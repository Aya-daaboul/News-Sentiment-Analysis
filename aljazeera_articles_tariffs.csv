tariffs,How much will Donald Trump’s tariffs cost US families?,"United States President Donald Trump’s broad array oftariffs on foreign goodshas spooked consumers, businesses and the stock market. But what will the specific impact be for typical American consumers?

US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered a figure on April 27 on CNN’s State of the Union.

The Democrat from New York said, as a candidate, Trump never fully explained to voters that tariffs wouldraise their costs. “It’s estimated it’ll raise the American costs … American families would have to pay about $4,000 more a year,” he said.

Calculating how typicalhouseholdswould be hit involves estimation and assumptions, especially given Trump’s frequent tinkering with what items will be tariffed and when. But Schumer’s figure is roughly in line with four independent estimates that PolitiFact identified.

Four of five estimates by groups with varying political ideologies range from $3,100 to $4,900 a year; the midpoint of that range is in line with Schumer’s figure. A fifth group estimated the cost to consumers would be $1,243.

The estimate variations stem from the groups’ differing assumptions about how the tariffs will be absorbed into the economy.

Schumer’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.

We identified five estimates on Trump’stariffs’ effecton US families, based on the tariffs he imposed before April 2 (including those onCanada and Mexico), the 10 percent across-the-board tariffs on virtually every country, and the 145 percent tariff on China. The estimates do not include the impact of higher country-by-country tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 but paused for 90 days beginning on April 9.

Here are the estimates in descending order.

Yale Budget Lab:The most recent estimate from the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University shows an average loss per household of $4,900. The lab also offered a more limited calculation that accounts for changes in consumer behaviour because of tariffs without factoring those in as losses; this worked out to a $2,600 loss per family.

The analysis found that low-earning families would be hit hardest. A family earning roughly $30,000 to $40,000 would lose 5.1 percent of its income, more than twice the proportional hit for a family earning well above $100,000.

Center for American Progress:The liberal group estimated an average loss of $4,600 annually.

American Action Forum:The centre-right think tank told PolitiFact that its pre-April 9 estimate of $3,900 loss per household remains a solid guess even though it was calculated using a 60 percent tariff on China, rather than the current 145 percent. Jacob Jensen, the group’s trade policy analyst, said tariffs as high as 145 percent curb consumer purchases so much that they tend to bring in less revenue than tariffs that are set at lower rates.

Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center:The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the average household loss would be $3,100.

Tax Foundation:The centre-right Tax Foundation put the average loss lower than the other four, at $1,243.

Erica York, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of federal tax policy, told PolitiFact that her group’s analysis has a more limited scope, encompassing households’ 2025 direct losses of income from higher taxes.

York said other groups’ estimates go beyond this, including loss in quality of life from having to switch to inferior products, factoring in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy response or using 2026 – assuming that it produces a full year of impact – rather than 2025, when the tariffs will be in force for less than a full year.

Differing methods such as these would produce variations in numbers, she said, citing the Yale Budget Lab’s dual estimates as an example.







Schumer said “it’s estimated” that Trump’s tariffs will mean “American families would have to pay about $4,000 more a year”.

Calculating the tariffs’ impact requires guesswork and is complicated by Trump’s frequent pauses on certain tariffs.

Four independent groups’ estimates range from $3,100 a year to $4,900 a year on average. The fifth, using a more restrictive method, estimated a $1,243 loss.

tariffs,Trump’s reciprocal tariffs: How much will each country be hit?,"President Donald Trump on Wednesdayannounceda range ofreciprocal tariffstargeting almost all countries that the United States trades with, taking a sledgehammer to Washington’s longstanding advocacy of free trade and globalisation.

Trump’slatest tariffs, which build on a series of similar steps he has taken since returning to office on January 20, are going to hit the countries with which Washington has large trade deficits, or that impose heavy tariffs on US goods. In 2023, the US imports were worth $1.1 trillion more than its exports; no other country has as large a trade deficit as the US.

Trump’s reciprocal tariffs also target countries likeSyria, which has faced Israeli attacks since the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, and Myanmar, which is reeling fromearthquake damage amid a civil war. They also target economies already struggling to balance their books, depending on loans from the International Monetary Fund, such asSri LankaandPakistan.

Here is how each country will specifically be targeted by Trump’s tariffs and the few sectors that are — for now — exempt from the penalties.

Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs in an executive order alongside an address in the Rose Garden at the White House on Wednesday. Trump had been describing April 2 as“Liberation Day”.

In the executive order, Trump said while the US trading policy has been built on the principle of reciprocity, taxes and barriers on US products by its trading partners had hurt the US.

The tariffs, he said, were a response. These reciprocal tariffs will come into effect on April 9.

During his address, Trump made the argument that the US is charging its trading partners with smaller tariffs compared with the tariffs and non-tariff barriers that the partners impose on the US.

“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” Trump said.

Holding up a chart of the new reciprocal tariffs, Trump cited the example of China, which he claimed charged US products with an average 67 percent tariff. “We’re going to be charging [China with] a discounted reciprocal tariff of 34 percent,” he said. “They charge us, we charge them less. How can anybody be upset? They will be because we’ve never charged anybody anything.”

But the effective tariff on China will actually be higher — and some countries will now be tariffed higher than the duties they levy on US imports. Chinese goods will face a 34 percent reciprocal tariff in addition to the20 percent tariffthat Trump imposed earlier, bringing the overall tariff on Chinese goods to 54 percent, close to his campaign promise of 60 percent. In 2024, China was the second-largest trading partner of the US.

The White House released an annexe of 57 target countries, territories and blocs which will face the increased tariffs. These include:



Yes. Apart from the 57 on the list announced on Wednesday, Trump has also imposed a flat 10 percent tariff on products coming from almost all the other trading partners of the US.

He did this by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.

Some of the leading countries that will face this 10 percent tariff rate on all exports to the US include:

These tariffs will come into effect on April 5.

While Canada and Mexico were not on the list of countries slapped with the latest tariffs, both US neighbours already face heavy tariffs.

On February 1, Trump signed executive ordersimposing 25 percent tariffson all goods imported from Mexico and Canada. Those tariffs were suspended for a month after negotiations between Trump and the leaders of the two countries.

In early March, Trump resurrected those tariffs, but on March 6,exempted goodsthat fall under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from these tariffs on March 6.

Non-USMCA-compliant energy and potash face a 10 percent tariff. All other non-USMCA-compliant products from Mexico and Canada continue to face 25 percent tariffs.

The White House on Wednesday reaffirmed that the tariffs on Mexico and Canada remain in place.

The exempt products include copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber articles, energy products and certain critical minerals that are unavailable in the US.

On March 26, Trump signed an executive order imposing 25 percent tariffs on auto imports and certain automobile parts. No additional tariffs on these products were announced on Wednesday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-how-much-will-each-country-be-hit
tariffs,Trump-China tariff war: Who’s winning so far?,"After United States President Donald Trump suspended his “reciprocal tariffs” on major US trading partners onApril 9, he ramped them up on China’s goods. US trade levies on most imports from China have climbed to 145 percent. Beijing retaliated with duties of its own, at 125 percent on US goods.

Trump has long accused China of exploiting the US on trade, casting his tariffs as necessary to revive domestic manufacturing and reshore jobs back to the US. He also wants to use tariffs to finance tax cuts. Most economists remain sceptical Trump will achieve his aims.

For now, the US and China are locked in a high-stakes game of chicken. The world is waiting to see which country will yield and which will stay the course. As Trump nears his first 100 days in office for the second time, here’s where the tariff war with China stands:

Trump recently played up the possibility of securing a trade deal with China. Last week, the US presidentsaidhis tariffs on China will “come down substantially” in the near future.

“We’re going to have a fair deal with China,” Trump told reporters on April 23, stirring hopes of a de-escalation. He also said his administration was “actively” negotiating with the Chinese side without elaborating.

On April 24, however, China’s Ministry of Commerce rebuffed president Trump’s remarks, saying there wereno talks taking placebetween the two countries.

“Any claims about the progress of China-US economic and trade negotiations are groundless and have no factual basis,” ministry spokesman He Yadong said.

While he insisted that Beijing won’t duck any economic blows from Washington, he also said the door was “wide open” for talks.

Last week, the Reuters news agency reported that China was evaluating exemptions for select US imports – a list of up to 131 products.

Beijing has not made any public statement on the issue.

Trump introduced his sweeping tariffs on China less than three weeks ago. The fallout for US businesses won’t be fully felt until later this year. Still, the warning signals are already flashing red.

Data from the US Department of Agriculture shows that exports of soya beans – the biggest US farm export – fell dramatically for the period April 11-17, the first full week of reporting since Trump’s China tariff announcement.

By April 17, net sales of US soya beans dropped by 50 percent compared with the previous week. That was driven by a 67 percent fall in weekly soya bean exports to China, which, until recently, was America’s biggest export destination for the legume.

According to Piergiuseppe Fortunato, an adjunct professor of economics at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, “China’s retaliatory tariffs will hit US farmers hard. Some may go out of business.” He added that all sectors with exposure to China would come under strain.

In 2023, the US exported roughly $15bn of oil, gas and coal to China. Losing that market would hit US energy firms.

Since the start of Trump’s tariff war, cargo shipments have plummeted. According to Linerlytica, a shipping data provider, Chinese freight bookings bound for the US fell by 30 to 60 percent in April.

The drastic reduction in shipping from America’s third largest trading partner – after Canada and Mexico – has not yet been felt. In May, however, thousands of companies will need to restock their inventories.

According to Bloomberg News, retail giants Walmart and Target told Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could roll out to Christmas.

Electronic appliances, such as TV sets and washing machines, made up 46.4 percent of US imports from China in 2022. The US also imports a lot of its clothing and pharmaceutical product ingredients from China. The price of these goods will begin to rise from next month.

On April 22, the International Monetary Fund raised its US inflation forecast to 3 percent in 2025, owing to tariffs – a full 1 percentage point higher than in January. The lender also lowered its US economic growth forecast and raised its expectation that the US will tip into recession this year.

Despite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trading partners.

According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, the US imported$438.9bnin Chinese goods last year.

That amounts to roughly 3 percent of China’s total economic output, which remains heavily reliant on exports.

In a report shared with its clients this month, Goldman Sachs said it expects Trump’s tariffs to drag down China’s gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 2.4 percentage points.

For their part, China’s top officials said the country can do without American farm and energy imports and promised to achieve a 5 percent GDP growth target for this year.

Zhao Chenxin, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that together with non-US imports, domestic farm and energy production would be enough to satisfy demand.

“Even if we do not purchase feed grains and oilseeds from the United States, it will not have much impact on our country’s grain supply,” Zhao said on Monday.

He also noted there would be limited impact on China’s energy supplies if companies stopped importing US fossil fuels.

In some ways, experts said, China has been preparing for this crisis.

Fortunato told Al Jazeera: “The US is one of China’s biggest export markets, so tariffs will slow GDP growth. But Beijing has played this smartly as it began diversifying its imports away from the US during the first Trump trade war” in 2018.

He also pointed out that “the US depends on China for up to 60 percent of itscritical mineralimports, used in everything from clean energy to military technology. The opposite flow simply isn’t there, so the US is more vulnerable.”

Trump has made little secret of his wish to conscript US allies into a trade war. The administration said it aims to strike free trade deals with the European Union, Great Britain and Japan.

More generally, reports suggest that Washington is asking trade partners to loosen their economic ties with China as a pre-condition for securing relief from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs.

Nevertheless, US allies seem largely opposed to any economic showdown with China. Last week, the European Commission said it has no intention of “decoupling” from China.

Elsewhere, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves recently told the Daily Telegraph newspaper: “China is the second biggest economy in the world, and it would be, I think, very foolish to not engage.”

Many countries are not in a position to abandon their trade ties with Beijing. The EU, in particular, has a huge trade deficit with China. Cutting off access to Chinese goods – both consumer products and inputs for industry – would bruise its already sluggish economy.

Across the developing world, China’s trade role is equally as crucial. Roughly a quarter of Bangladesh’s and Cambodia’s imports come from China. Nigeria and Saudi Arabia are similarly dependent on Beijing for their goods imports.

“It’s hard to see why countries would want to undermine their own business interests to try and reduce America’s trade deficit with China,” Fortunato said. “On this point, I think Trump has been short-sighted and may be forced to blink first on lowering tariffs with China.”

The Chinese Communist Party doesn’t need to worry about its next election cycle. Trump’s Republican Party does, so Beijing has the political upper hand in Trump’s trade war. Simply put, it has more time on its side.

For Trump’s party, his sabre rattling already looks politically costly. A newEconomist-YouGovpoll shows Americans reporting Trump’s economic actions have hurt them personally more than they’ve helped by a 30-point margin.

And public approval of the president’s economic management has been low for a while: It had fallen to 37 percent in aReuters-Ipsos pollpublished on March 31, his lowest score ever in that survey.

If Trump stays the course, it is likely that his approval ratings might fall still lower, jeopardising the Republican Party’s fragile grip on the US House of Representatives – and possibly the Senate, experts said.

“For these reasons”, Fortunato said, “China does not feel compelled to rush to the negotiating table to secure a trade deal. That will probably fall to Trump.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/28/trump-china-tariff-war-whos-winning-so-far
tariffs,Chinese export hike reported as tariff talks with US set to start,"China reported that its exports rose more than expected in April as it prepares for weekendtalksover tariffs with the United States.

Outbound shipments from the world’s second-largest economy registered a year-on-year rise of 8.1 percent last month, according to government data published on Friday. The result was substantially higher than the 2 percent predicted by economists amid thetrade warwith the US started by President Donald Trump.

The rise in overall exports in April came despite a 21 percent drop in sales to the US, after Trump announced a general tariff of 145 percent on Chinese goods.

China appears to have succeeded in efforts to pivot to other markets, said analysts.

“Reports of the death of China’s exports look to be greatly exaggerated,” said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at Dutch bank ING. “However you slice it, the data looks better than most market participants expected.”

The figures may also have been buoyed by demand for materials from overseas manufacturers rushing out goods during a 90-day pause on the US tariffs.

Economist Zichun Huang, of Capital Economics, warned that China’s export growth could “turn negative” later this year, with exports to the US set for “further declines” over the coming months, “not all of which will be offset by increased trade with other countries”.

The data was released a day before China’s trade envoy He Lifeng is due to sit down with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the Swiss capital Geneva.

The talks will be the first official engagement between Beijing and Washington on trade sinceTrumpslapped the 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods, prompting a retaliatory 125 percent duty from China.

Ahead of the meeting, Trump floated the idea of an 80 percent tariff on Chinese goods as an alternative to the punitive 145 percent, saying that the amount “seems right”.

The Reuters news agency, quoting unnamed sources, reported that behind closed doors, Chinese officials have grown increasingly alarmed about the effect of the tariffs war on the economy, and the risk of isolation as China’s trading partners have started negotiating deals with Washington.







The lead-up to the Geneva talks has highlighted the different negotiating approaches on either side, with Trump reportedly pushing for direct talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

That proposal was rejected, partly because Beijing was spooked by Trump’s public berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February, according to one source quoted by Reuters.

According to the source, any unscripted hostile interaction between the US and Chinese leaders would be seen as an unacceptable loss of face for Xi.

“Both sides I think are balancing, trying to look tough with not wanting to be responsible for sinking the global economy,” said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese business affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/9/chinese-exports-rise-ahead-of-tariff-talks-with-us
tariffs,"Sorry, America, tariffs won’t bring jobs back","At a White House dinner back in 2011, Steve Jobs was asked by President Obama what it would take to build iPhones in the United States. Jobs knew where this was going. “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” he replied. Supply chains and ecosystems that sustain manufacturing of hi-tech products like the iPhone take years to get going. The skills, capabilities and relationships that are involved take even longer to develop. Factories cannot simply be picked up from one place and transplanted into another.

President Trump decided to try, anyway. On “Liberation Day”, he announced sweeping tariffs, which were not reciprocal but based on the idea of balancing trade deficits.This has thrown the economy into turmoil and sent markets plunging – under pressure mainly from Wall Street, he delayed the higher tariffs for 90 days but ratcheted them up for China.Markets recovered somewhat but the uncertainty remains and might even have done some permanent damage already by being baked into the cost of capital.









Much analysis since the announcement about tariffs has focused on the formula used to calculate them, and the flawed understanding of economics that the new policy is based on. The formula for tariffs certainly does not measure what the president thinks it measures. Nor does it make sense for America to make everything itself. There are things that we buy in our individual lives without expecting the seller to buy something from us. And if a country tries to build everything, it cannot specialise. This means a decline in productivity and the country becoming less competitive in many areas that it would like to dominate.

Ceteris Paribus, imposing blanket tariffs will do more harm than good, but it is worth understanding the reason behind it. It is not that America is being “ripped off” by other countries. America’s competitiveness problem is rooted in the globalisation of production. More specifically, in the case of America, it is the “China syndrome” or the China Shock, terms coined by David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson in their 2013paper. As a result of a flood of imports from China, an estimated two to three million US manufacturing jobs were lost between 1999 and 2011. Many more have been lost since then. Some areas, especially where industries competed head-on with China – in the Midwest and South – were hit hard.

These job losses were not offset by new jobs in the same regions, with the affected communities experiencing lower wages, higher unemployment and increases in opioid addiction, social instability, and political polarisation. Even workers outside manufacturing saw wage stagnation, especially those without college degrees, as the labour market became more competitive and bargaining power weakened. Promises that displaced workers could “learn to code” or move to tech jobs often failed. Many workers couldn’t easily retrain or relocate, especially older ones or those in distressed communities.

With globalisation, Wall Street has benefitted, but not Main Street. It is not just low-value-added products, however. America’s trade balance in advanced technology products is also negative. In 2024, it incurred adeficitof nearly $300 bn in that category. America has been borrowing to finance deficits and to continue consuming. This strategy is fundamentally unsustainable and something has to change.

Is imposition of tariffs on the whole world the answer to America’s competitiveness problems? It depends upon what America is trying to achieve through that. Is it leverage? Unfettered access to foreign markets? Or bringing all the jobs that it has outsourced over the years back?

On leverage, America might be able to cut some deals, but at the expense of American people’s purchasing power. It might also be able to get countries to lower some barriers to American exports, but I doubt that will save GM or Ford. And as for bringing jobs back, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is now saying factories that return to the United States will be run mostly by robots!

Strongarming countries and companies into investing in America will only go so far. Transferring ecosystems around particular products takes many years. If America’s objective is to get its dominance in innovation, development and manufacturing back, slashing research funding across the board does not make sense, either. Going after university research eliminates the “commons” that all American corporations benefit from. It’s an own goal.

If the idea is to reverse the outsourcing corporations rely upon to generate wealth for investors, that’s like putting toothpaste back into the tube. How long is Trump willing to persist? Pressure is already mounting from powerful actors and fault lines are appearing within the Republican Party. China’s tit-for-tat stance is not helping. Tariffs are not likely to work for Trump, and persisting with this strategy and raising inflation will not do him any favours in the midterms, but the problem of Wall Street v Main Street will only get worse, and someone, whether Trump or his successors, will need to address it.

tariffs,How Trump flip-flopped on pausing tariffs,"In a reversal of the plan he defended for days, United States President Donald Trump delayed almost all of the country-by-countrytariffshe unveiled on April 2.

For two days, Trump and the White House denied that he was considering a pause in the tariff planshakingglobal markets.

During an April 7 Oval Office event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a reporter asked Trump, “Would you be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiation?”

“Well, we’re not looking at that,” Trump said. “We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they’re going to be fair deals. And in certain cases, they’re going to be paying substantial tariffs. They’ll be fair deals.”

On April 9 – hours after he told everyone to “BE COOL!” – Trump changed course. “I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

He made an exception for China, raising its tariff to 125 percent.

Tariffsare a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their cost is often passed on to consumers through higher prices.

The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. However, economists have said it’s unlikely high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans.

On the morning of April 7, X accounts amplified a significant exaggeration of a noncommittal response from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett responding to the possibility of a 90-day tariff pause. CNBC anchors repeated the unconfirmed information and later aired a correction.

Trump on April 7 shared a clip of Fox News host Maria Bartiromo saying earlier that morning, “Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening. … President Trump is not going to bend.”

The White House held Trump’s line; its “Rapid Response 47” X account said reports that Trump was expected to issue a 90-day pause were “fake news”. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC the same thing.

During an April 8 White House media briefing, a reporter asked Leavitt if Trump was considering holding off on imposing some tariffs or reversing them due to negotiations with other countries.

“The president was asked and answered this yesterday,” Leavitt said. “He said he is not considering an extension or delay. I spoke to him before this briefing, that was not his mindset. He expects that these tariffs are going to go into effect.”

The US stock market experienced tumultuous days and losses amid Trump’s announced tariffs.









Trump’s Truth Social announcement about a pause for most tariffs came shortly after 1pm ET on April 9. He said more than 75 countries had called federal officials tonegotiatea solution and had not retaliated, except for China.

A few hours later at an event with auto racers, a reporter asked Trump to explain his thinking. Trump said: “Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.”

Responding to another question about the pause, Trump said, “I think in financial markets, because they change. Look how much it changed today. We went from, you know, pretty moderate today, but over the last few days, it looked pretty glum to, I guess they say it was the biggest day in financial history.”

Even after the 9.5 percent increase in the S&P 500 market index on April 9, the metric was still down nearly 11 percent since its peak under Trump on February 19, wiping away all gains since early September 2024, under both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden.

A reporter noted how Trump went from no pause to a pause in two days.

Trump said: “You have to have flexibility. I could say, here’s a wall and I’m gonna go through that wall. I’m gonna go through it no matter what. Keep going and you can’t go through the wall. Sometimes you have to be able to go under the wall, around the wall, or over the wall. These guys know that better than anybody, right? You got to go around them sometimes, you’re not gonna go through them.”

Trump said he was thinking about a pause “over the last few days” as he was talking with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning, just wrote it up,” Trump said.

tariffs,Trump threatens tariffs on foreign films: Who could be hit?,"United States President Donald Trump hasthreatened to imposea 100 percent tariff on foreign films, calling them a “National Security threat” in a social media post on Sunday.

With details sparse, Trump’s threat has left many questions lingering. We unpack what his threat, if enforced, could mean; which film industries might take a hit; how his tariff targets might retaliate and how this would affect ticket prices.









“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. He added that other countries are offering “all sorts of incentives” to drive filmmakers and studios away from the US.

“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,” Trump wrote.

Trump also described foreign films as “messaging and propaganda”.

He said he was authorising the Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representative “to immediately begin the process” of imposing a 100 percent tariff on films coming into the US which are “produced in Foreign Lands”.

On Monday, the White House appeared to take a step back. “Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.

Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom also announced on Monday that he wants to create a $7.5bn federal film tax credit to boost the entertainment industry, working with the Trump administration.

That’s one of the many questions that have arisen from Trump’s threat.

As with most things, films in a globalised world rarely rely on resources from just one country: Hollywood movies, for instance, might have an American financial backer but could be shot in other countries, with actors and crew from different parts of the world.

For instance, one of 2024’s top-grossing Hollywood films, Wicked, was filmed in Sky Studios Elstree in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, in the United Kingdom.

Parts of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, released in 2023, were filmed in Warner Brothers’ studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire in the UK. Barbie’s California-esque Dreamhouse was actually built in a UK studio. During filming, Barbie’s production generated more than 80 million pounds ($106m) for the UK economy, creating jobs and supporting local businesses.

Trading bright pink pool slides for candy-churning Rube Goldberg machines, the same studio morphed into Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory in Paul King’s Wonka, released later that year.

Many US movies last year were also filmed partly or completely in Australia, including The Fall Guy, a comedy action film starring Ryan Gosling, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. Australia’s federal government offers incentives for big film projects in Australia, including a 30 percent rebate under the location offset scheme. New Zealand offers similar tax break incentives.

Released in the same year, US Gothic horror film Nosferatu was filmed in Prague, Czech Republic. US movies have also been filmed in New Zealand, Spain and Germany, among other countries.

On the flip side, many non-US films are shot at least partly in the US. Successful Bollywood movies of the past two decades have used the Brooklyn Bridge, Miami’s beaches and Chicago’s neighbourhoods as backdrops for plots that have ranged from romantic comedies to robberies – adding to the attraction of US cities for Indian tourists. It’s unclear whether such films – which bring revenue to the US – would classify as “foreign” films.

Indian films generate significant revenue from markets abroad. The 2016 film, Dangal, a biopic of India’s famous wrestling sisters, Geeta Phogat and Babita Phogat, generated about $12.4m from the US and Canada, according to website Box Office India.

Indian films gross about $100m at the US box office, Shibasish Sarkar, president of the Producers Guild of India, told the Press Trust of India (PTI) on Monday. “The diaspora market, which is price-sensitive, became a revenue source for Indian films,” filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri told PTI. Sarkar and Agnihotri speculated that ticket prices would increase if the tariffs were applied. “I don’t think anybody will watch them in theatres, especially when the films will be available on Netflix, Amazon, etc,” Agnihotri said.

The US is home to 5.4 million people of Indian origin, the largest Indian diaspora population in the world.

But it isn’t just Indian films that earn significantly in the US. Paddington in Peru, the 2024 film that’s part of the UK franchise revolving around Paddington, the anthropomorphic bear, earned more than $45m in the US.

Films from South Korea also fare well in US markets. In April this year, animated film The King of Kings, directed by Seong Ho Jang, earned $54.7m at the box office, surpassing Bong Joon-ho’s 2019 film Academy Award-winning Parasite, which generated $53.8m in the US. These are the top-earning South Korean films in the US. But The King of the Kings is an English-language film, starring big Hollywood names such as Oscar Isaac. Parasite is a Korean-language film.

On the other hand, films from countries like China are barely reliant on US viewership – with language still a barrier they haven’t been able to overcome.

In February this year, Chinese animated film Ne Zha 2 became the highest-grossing animated film in history, making $1.9bn from nearly 80,000 screens four weeks after its release, according to Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan. More than 99 percent of the Mandarin-language film’s box office income came from mainland China. Yolo, the Chinese comedy superhit from 2024, earned only $2m in the US despite being the 14th highest-grossing film globally, according to IMDb’s Box Office Mojo.

Australian home affairs minister and minister for the arts, Tony Burke, responded to Trump’s threat: “Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry.”

New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said his government was awaiting further details on the tariffs. “We’ll have to see the detail of what actually ultimately emerges. But we’ll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,” he said.

Philippa Childs, the head of UK media and entertainment union Bectu, called on her government to protect its film industry.

“These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering,” Childs said.

US media stocks fell on Monday in the aftermath of Trump’s announcement. The shares for streaming giant Netflix fell by 2.5 percent in early trading, while Disney, Warner Brothers and Comcast also declined between 0.7 and 1.7 percent.

“There is too much uncertainty, and this latest move raises more questions than answers,” PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told the Reuters news agency. “It doesn’t feel like something that will happen in the short term as everyone will be grappling to understand the whole process. Inevitably costs will be passed on to consumers.”

In recent years, Hollywood has faced several setbacks, among them the COVID-19 pandemic.

Last year, Hollywood studios grossed about $30bn globally, down by about 7 percent from 2023, according to Gower Street Analytics. Despite last year’s performance being better in terms of revenue than 2020, 2021 and 2022, it was still about 20 percent below the pre-pandemic average.

In 2023, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) – trade unions representing Hollywood writers and performers – went on strike, demanding better working conditions and stronger protection against AI use. This led to the closure of some studios while others scaled back staff.

In January this year,wildfiresravaged Los Angeles, the home of Hollywood. Several filming locations for television and movie productions in southern California were damaged or destroyed. Many actors alsolost their homesto the fire.

Many in the US film and television industry have rallied to bring production back to Hollywood, urging California legislators and Governor Newsom to enact measures such as raising tax incentives to bring this to effect. The argument is that Hollywood is full of middle-class workers, gig workers and local businesses hit by a decline in production.

“If we don’t stop the bleeding, then Los Angeles is at risk of becoming Detroit,” said filmmaker Sarah Adina Smith, an organiser of the “Stay in LA” campaign that calls for productions to remain in the city, Reuters reported in April.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/6/trump-threatens-tariffs-on-foreign-films-who-could-be-hit
tariffs,How much revenue has the US earned from Trump’s tariffs?,"United States President Donald Trump said this month that his tariffs were bringing in $2bn a day already. The real number turned out to be $192m per day at the time.

While the import revenue has increased slightly since then, it is still nowhere close to what the president had suggested.

On Friday, April 25, according to the most recent data from the US Department of Commerce, the US brought in $285m in customs and certain excise taxes for the day. Thus far in April, the total has hit more than $16.1bn. The daily income is up from $128m that was brought in on January 17, the last day of the administration of former President Joe Biden for which the US Treasury Department released a daily report.

Trump had threatened to impose “retaliatory tariffs”on nearly all trading partners across the globe. He kept the highest at 125 percent for China in addition to an earlier 20 percent rate because of the country’s role in the fentanyl trade, Trump said.

On April 9, barring China, he paused the retaliatory tariffs and put in place a 10 percent levy on all imports to the US. He also kept in place tariffs he had announced in March on imports of cars, steel, aluminium and potash, all of which are now feeding into US revenue. On Tuesday, the White House said Trump was aiming to ease some auto tariffs and companies paying car tariffs would no longer be charged other levies, such as on aluminium and steel, with reimbursements in the pipeline for such tariffs that had already been paid.

Beijing, in turn, has slapped the US with 125 percent tariffs. Since then, both sides have taken tiny steps back. The US exempted some electronic imports from China from its tariffs, and the latter was considering exemptions of certain imports, according to media reports.



All of this is expected to weigh on the US consumer. According to the Budget Lab at Yale, the American public faces the highest average tariff rate in more than a century at 28 percent.

Before Trump took office, there were still tariffs in place on a multitude of goods ranging from lumber to electric vehicles.

The Biden administration was tough on Chinese goods as well. In 2024, Biden introduced a 100 percent tariff on electric vehicles, 25 percent on steel and aluminium and 50 percent on semiconductor chips. The move, however, was a continuation of a tariff policy laid out during Trump’s first term.







Trump had introduced heavy tariffs on steel in 2018 at 25 percent, and 10 percent on aluminium quickly followed. In 2019, Trump lifted those tariffs on Canada and Mexico. In 2021, Biden walked back tariffs outlined by Trump specifically for the European Union as steel prices surged amid supply chain concerns brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2024, Biden also raised lumber tariffs on Canada – which have been a longstanding point of contention between the two nations – to 14.5 percent, up from 8.5 percent the year before. Those tariffs are expected to more than double in the coming months to 34.5 percent.

The lumber tariffs were slammed as “detrimental” by the National Association of Home Builders amid a housing affordability crisis in the US. But those challenges began in 2017 when the first Trump administration introduced a 20 percent tariff that was later reduced to 8.5 percent in April 2022.







Other notable tariffs introduced by the Biden administration were a result of widespread economic sanctions, including a 35 percent tariff on certain Russian imports in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Other countries like Canada and the United Kingdom imposed similar tariffs at 35 percent.

Trump’s tariffs have much of the world on edge, as well as Wall Street and Main Street. The US Commerce Department released a report this month on consumer spending that showed a 1.4 percent increase over last month. While ordinarily that would indicate an uptick in the economy, this time economists think it can be attributed to consumers spending on key goods before prices go up because of the new tariffs.

Other data show consumer confidence tumbling. The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index, released April 11 for the month of March, dropped 11 percent from the month before. In March, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence fell to a 12-year low.







Companies in the auto industry have already begun furloughs and layoffs. This month, Stellantis laid off 900 people, and General Motors laid off 200 as a result of tariff uncertainty. Volvo announced it would slash 800 US jobs due to the tariffs. The Budget Lab at Yale forecasts that the tariffs could cost 770,000 jobs in the US by the end of the year.

There are concerns in every corner of the world. In the citrus industry alone, there could be 35,000 jobs lost in South Africa because of the tariffs. In the Republic of Ireland, one of the world’s largest producers of pharmaceuticals, tariffs could cost as many as 80,000 jobs. And Mexico has expressed concerns that tariffs could result in the loss of upwards of 400,000 of its jobs.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/4/29/how-much-revenue-has-the-us-earned-from-trumps-tariffs
tariffs,Are US-made cars spared from Trump’s auto tariffs?,"United States President Donald Trump and his allies have offered a solution to avoiding price hikes because of hiscar tariffs: buy American.

Trump told NBC News on March 29 that he “couldn’t care less” if foreign car manufacturers raised prices in response to tariffs. “I hope they raise their prices because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars,” Trump said. “We have plenty.”









The administration’s25 percent tariffon imported cars took effect on April 3, and an additional tariff on imported auto parts is set to take effect on May 3.

Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their costs are often passed down to consumers through higher prices.

Fox News host Jesse Watters made a similar statement to Trump on April 3: “If you’re worried cars are going to cost more, buy American.” Watters cited a clip of Ford Motor Co’s promotion to temporarily give customers its employee rate on cars.







Bernie Moreno, a Republican senator from Ohio who owned multiple car dealerships before taking office, echoed Trump in an April 2 CNN interview.

Moreno said the “only ones that are mostly hurt are the cars that are made overseas, exclusively, and are shipped into the United States. The ultra-luxury cars.”

However, this is contradicted by an analysis by Cox Automotive, a research firm, which found that the “25 percent tariff on imported vehicles will apply to nearly 80 percent of vehicles priced under $30,000”. The analysis cited models such as the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Trax and Trailblazer, Nissan Sentra and Honda HR-V.

Senator Moreno added that among “mainstream cars – a Honda, a Toyota, a Subaru, a Ford, a Chevy – if one car goes up in price, because there’s a tariff, that person will just buy the other one that doesn’t have a tariff, which is your American-made automobile”.

Manycar expertssaid it is not so simple to avoid price increases by buying US cars, because those assembled in the US also use imported parts.

“The concept of an American-made car with all parts from the US is a fictional tale,” said Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. “They will tariff those parts.”

Car companies rely on imported parts to varying degrees. For example, the Tesla Model Y has 70 percent of the value of its parts made in the US or Canada. For the Ford F-150, it is 45 percent.

The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, otherfederal taxescould be cut. But economists have said it is unlikely that high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans.

In response to a PolitiFact email asking about Moreno’s statement on US-made cars, a spokesperson for the senator attacked the publication and provided no answers to its questions about cars and tariffs. The White House, when contacted, said that some auto parts are exempted from tariffs.







Moreno said that US-assembled cars that get parts fromMexicoand Canada will be “completely tariff-free” if they comply with theUS-Mexico-Canada Agreementthat Trump’s administration negotiated in 2018.

But many auto parts used in the US come from countries other than Mexico and Canada.

Jason Miller, a Michigan State University supply chain management professor, examined auto tariff data and told PolitiFact that it showed Mexico “clearly top of the list” for car parts imported into the US.Chinais second (because of lithium-ion batteries), Japan is fourth, South Korea is fifth and Germany is sixth.







Miller said Trump’s othertariffs on steel and aluminiummean that even if a car were 100 percent assembled from only domestic components, costs would still rise because steel and aluminium prices are increasing in the US.

“They just aren’t oversimplifying things, they are outright lying,” Miller said about people saying car shoppers can buy all US-made cars.  Also, not all auto parts from Mexico comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, so those are being tariffed, too, he said.

Amy R Broglin-Peterson, a Michigan State University expert on supply chain management, said, “All vehicles use at least some percentage of foreign parts – period. There is no vehicle model that uses 100 percent American-manufactured parts.”

The Wall Street Journal reported on April 4 that, at first glance, Ford is best positioned to weather tariffs because 80 percent of its cars, pick-up trucks and SUVs sold in the US are manufactured domestically, and so are many of the parts.

Many components of Ford’s F-150s, such as alternators and wheels, come fromother countriesand, starting in May, those parts could face a new 25 percent tax. The Wall Street Journal wrote, “So even though Ford’s trucks are built in the American heartland, import tariffs could jack up the average price by thousands of dollars”.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) publishes data about the US and Canadian content by value of the parts used to assemble passenger motor vehicles in the US and foreign countries. The data shows that some Toyota car lines built in the US, such as Corolla, include at least 25 percent value of parts imported from Japan.

A Toyota spokesperson said that 47 percent of vehicles the company sold in the US in 2024 were built in the US.

USA Today analysed NHTSA data for multiple automakers and found that “for all models assembled and available for sale in the US, 47 percent of the parts (by value) originated from the US or Canada”.

A Cox Automotive spokesperson said that the average US-made vehicle has about 50 percent of its parts or components by value imported.







The long-term effect of the tariffs on the car industry us difficult to predict. Cox Automotive predicted strong sales until the pre-tariff inventory declines.

“But all roads lead to this fact: In the coming months and years, as new tariffs settle into place, vehicle prices in the US are expected to increase,” Cox wrote in an April 4 market insights report.

Cox predicted that vehicles affected by these tariffs could see prices increase by 10 percent to 15 percent, and at least a 5 percent increase for vehicles not subject to the full tariff.







“Production disruptions and declines could be a reality this summer, especially as automakers and suppliers work to align practices with the new rules,” Cox wrote.

As the price of cars manufactured in foreign countries rises, producers of competing US models with fewer imported parts will raise their prices, not dollar for dollar, but perhaps 40 cents per dollar, Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted.

“US auto manufacturers are hurting, and they will raise prices where they can,” Hufbauer said.

tariffs,China says it is ‘evaluating’ Trump administration’s outreach on tariffs,"China has said it is considering proposals by the United States to begin negotiations on US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.

The US has “recently, through relevant channels, actively conveyed messages to China, expressing a desire to engage in talks”, China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Friday.

“China is currently evaluating this.”

Beijing’s remarks come after Chinese state media reported earlier in the week that the Trump administration had “proactively reached out” through multiple channels.

Trump’s trade war with China has resulted in a de facto mutual trade embargo between the world’s two largest economies.

Businesses and investors have been anxiously waiting for signs that Washington and Beijing will ease their steep tariffs on each other’s goods amid fears that a protracted standoff will inflict serious damage on the global economy.

The International Monetary Fund last month lowered its global growth forecast for 2025 to 2.8 percent, down from 3.3 percent in January, while JPMorgan Chase has put the likelihood of a US recession this year at 60 percent.

Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial services company in Beijing, said that China appears to be sincere about being open to talks provided the US is serious.

“Again, they’ve got a lot of tools: The tariffs are already in place, but they also have export controls and can launch more probes into US companies,” Beddor told Al Jazeera.

“The list goes on. Most importantly, they’re ready to stimulate to blunt the damage to economic growth. But policymakers also clearly understand that it would be a lot better if they didn’t have to use those tools because there was a de-escalation.”

Trump, who has slapped a 145 percent tariff on Chinese exports, has repeatedly insisted that his administration is in negotiations with Beijing, a claim that Chinese officials have rejected as “groundless”.

On Wednesday, Trump said there was a “very good chance” he would reach a trade deal with China, so long as it was “fair”.

In its statement on Friday, China’s Commerce Ministry said that its stance on the trade dispute had been consistent.

“If there is a fight, we will fight to the end; if there are talks, the door is open,” the ministry said.

“The tariff war and trade war were unilaterally initiated by the US, and if the US wants to talk, it should demonstrate sincerity by preparing to correct its erroneous actions and rescind the unilateral imposition of additional tariffs,” it said, adding that “attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and blackmail” would not work with China.

In an interview with Fox News that aired on Thursday night, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Trump’s tariffs were badly hurting the Chinese economy and Beijing was eager to talk.

“The Chinese are reaching out, they want to meet, they want to talk,” Rubio told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “We’ve got people involved in that.”

Rubio also said that the tensions were a “wake-up call” for the US, and the country should not be as dependent on China.

“Two more years in this direction, and we are going to be in a lot of trouble, really dependent on China,” he said. “So, I do think there is this broader question about how much we should buy from them at all.”

Steven Okun, the CEO of Singapore-based consultancy APAC Advisors, said it would not be a surprise to see meetings between Chinese and US officials “given the interdependence of their economies and the damage being done to both”, but characterising such contact as a “negotiation” would be premature.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/2/china-says-it-is-considering-trump-administrations-outreach-on-tariffs
tariffs,Trump Tariffs: What products do the EU and US buy from each other?,"The United States buys $235.6bn more in goods than it sells to the 27 countries that make up the European Union (EU).

That $236bn gap, known as the trade deficit, is something US President Donald Trump wants to reduce.









In an effort to close the gap, onApril 2the US imposed a 20 percent tariff on goods imported from the EU, aimed at reducing European exports to the US and encouraging domestic production.

In addition, the EU faces a 25 percent US tariff on steel, aluminium and cars.

In response, the EU decided to impose retaliatory tariffs on $23.8bn worth of US goods, with EU officials describing the US tariffs as “unjustified and damaging”.

In 2024, trade between the US and EU reached nearly $1 trillion, making the EU the biggest trading partner bloc for the US.

The US mainly exports fuels, pharmaceutical products, machinery and aircraft to the EU, according to the US International Trade Commission.

In 2024, the US sold $370.2bn worth of goods to the EU. The main exports include:

The US mainly buys pharmaceutical products from the EU, as well as mechanical appliances, cars and other non-railway vehicles.



In 2024, the US bought $605.8bn worth of goods from the EU. The main imports include:

According to the US International Trade Administration, the midwestern state of Indiana buys the most of any other state from the EU. It bought $49.3bn worth of goods in 2024.

New Jersey imported the second-most goods from the EU, valued at $40.9bn, followed by North Carolina, which bought $39.6bn.

Texas leads the US in exports to the EU, selling $81.5bn worth of goods in 2024. California ranks second, with $28bn in sales, followed by Louisiana at $20.8bn.

Explore the table below to see which states import and export the most to and from the EU.



Aerospace products and parts are the top exports from the US to the EU, with 15 states reporting this category as their primary export. These states include Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Washington.

Aerospace products consist of complete aircraft and aircraft parts, with the US specifically exporting Boeing commercial aircraft and Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets to the EU.



Pharmaceuticals and medicines are the leading import for 11 US states, including Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.

Motor vehicles and vehicle parts rank second, being the top import for eight states: Alabama, California, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas.

According to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), the US is the second-largest market for new EU vehicle exports after the UK, where the US accounted for 22 percent of the EU’s vehicle export market in 2024.

The Center for Automotive Research found that the Detroit Three automakers – General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) – will see an average cost of the tariff per vehicle for imported vehicle parts of $4,911, higher than the overall industry’s average of $4,239 per vehicle.

tariffs,EU imposes tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicles,"The European Union has imposed extra duties of up to 37.6 percent on imports of electric vehicles (EVs) made in China, the bloc announced, despite Beijing’s warnings the move would unleash a trade war.

The European Commission said on Thursday that the tariffs were put in place because of “unfair” state subsidies and will kick off on Friday.

There is, however, a four-month window during which the tariffs are only provisional and talks are expected to continue between the two sides.

The Commission, the EU’s executive, launched an investigation last year intoChinese EV manufacturerson whether state subsidies were unfairly undercutting European carmakers.

After four months, when the probe concludes, the Commission could propose “definite duties” that would apply for five years and on which the 27-member bloc would vote.

The move raises duties from the current level of 10 percent as trade spats widen between the EU and China, especially focusing on green technologies.

The provisional duties of between 17.4 percent and 37.6 percent, without backdating, are designed to prevent what Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built by state subsidies.







The Chinese government has previously said it would take “all necessary measures” to safeguard the country’s interests, which could includeretaliatory tariffson exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.

The United States has alreadyhiked customs dutieson Chinese EVs to 100 percent, while Canada is considering similar action.

“There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,” said He Yadong, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce.

The duties on Chinese manufacturers include 17.4 percent for BYD, 19.9 percent for Geely and 37.6 percent for SAIC, the EU said.

Companies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the antisubsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8 percent tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6 percent.

The Commission has estimated Chinese brands’ share of the EU market has risen to 8 percent from below 1 percent in 2019 and could reach 15 percent in 2025.

It said prices are about 20 percent below those of EU-made models.

Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, slammed the proposed tariffs and warned they would not strengthen Europe’s car industry in the long term.

“The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,” a Volkswagen spokesperson said in a statement.

The package unveiled by Ishiba on Friday includes support for corporate financing as well as subsidies to lower petrol prices by 10 yen ($0.07) a litre (0.26 gallons), and partially cover electricity bills for three months from July, a government document showed.

“I have instructed cabinet members to make the utmost efforts to aid firms and households that have been worried about tariff impact,” Ishiba said at a tariff task force meeting.

US tariffs could have a significant impact on Japanese industries that support the economy such as automobiles and steel, he said.

To help small and mid-sized companies more vulnerable to economic swings, a larger scope of firms will be eligible for low-interest loans extended by government-backed banks.

The government will also consider additional measures to boost domestic consumption depending on the impact of US tariffs on Japan’s massive automotive industry.







Friday’s package could be financed by a reserve fund, eliminating the need to compile an extra budget, said economy minister Ryosei Akazawa.

US President Donald Trump on April 2 introduced a 25 percent tariff on car and truck imports. He also announced a 24 percent tariff on all Japanese goods, later cutting that to 10 percent for 90 days.

Akazawa, who serves asJapan‘s top trade negotiator, will visit Washington next week for a second round of trade talks.

On Thursday, the Nikkei business daily reported that Japan is considering increasing soya bean imports from the US as part of negotiations.

tariffs,"Trump says lower tariffs depend on China, as US states sue over trade war","United States President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to lower his crippling tariffs on China, but insisted the timeline for any relief will depend on Beijing.

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he could announce new tariff rates on US trading partners,including China, over the next few weeks, depending on the outcome of his administration’s negotiations with other countries.

“That depends on them. We have a situation where we have a very, very great place. It’s called the United States of America, and it’s been ripped off for years and years,” Trump said when asked how soon he could lower the 145 percent tariffhe has imposed on most Chinese goods.

“In the end, what I think is going to happen is we’re going to have great deals, and by the way, if we don’t have a deal with a company or a country, we’re going to set the tariff.”

Trump said he got on “very well” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and he hoped to see the sides reach a deal.

“Otherwise, we will set a price,” Trump said.

Asked earlier on Wednesday if his administration was “actively” talking to China, Trump said: “Actively. Everything is active. Everybody wants to be a part of what we’re doing.”







Trump’s comments came as Wall Street rallied for a second straight day on hopes that Washington and Beijing will de-escalate tensions that have spiralled into an effective trade embargo between the world’s two largest economies.

The benchmark S&P 500 closed 1.67 percent higher on Wednesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished up 2.50 percent, adding to gains the previous day spurred by US Treasury Scott Bessent’s comments that a trade with China was “unsustainable”.

On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration was considering slashing tariffs on Chinese goods by 50-60 percent in a bid to lower tensions.

The report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said that Trump was considering a number of options for easing the duties but would expect to see Beijing lower its 125 tariffs on US goods in return.

On Tuesday, Trump publicly acknowledged that his 145 percent tariff on China was “very high” and said the rate would “come down substantially” at some point.

China has said itopposes protectionist measuressuch as tariffs, but that it is prepared to “fight to the end” if the US continues to escalate its trade salvoes.

“We have made it very clear that China does not look for a war, but neither are we afraid of it. We will fight, if fight we must,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a regular media briefing on Wednesday.

“Our doors are open if the US wants to talk. If a negotiated solution is truly what the US wants, it should stop threatening and blackmailing China and seek dialogue based on equality, respect and mutual benefit.”







The US-China trade war has raised fears of a global economic slowdown, with the International Monetary Fund earlier this week slashing its 2025 growth forecast from 3.3 percent to 2.8 percent.

On Wednesday, a group of 12 US states, including Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois and New York, filed a lawsuit challenging Trump’s authority to impose the tariffs without the approval of the US Congress.

In the suit filed at the US Court of International Trade in New York, the states said that Trump had “upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy”.

“President Trump’s insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless – it is illegal,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement.

“Arizona cannot afford President Trump’s massive tax increase. No matter what the White House claims, tariffs are a tax that will be passed on to Arizona consumers.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/4/24/trump-says-lower-tariffs-depend-on-china-as-us-states-sue-over-trade-war
tariffs,US Senate rejects bid to block Trump’s tariffs,"The United States Senate has rejected an effort to block US President Donald Trump’s tariffs amid bipartisan concerns about the impact of his trade salvoes on the economy.

The upper house of the US Congress voted 49-49 to knock back the resolution on Wednesday, hours after government data showed that the US economy shrank for the first time in three years.

Three Republican senators – Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – voted for the measure in a rare rebuke of Trump from within his own party, along with all present Democrats and Independents.

“The United States Senate cannot be an idle spectator in the tariff madness,” Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who represents Oregon, said ahead of the vote.

“The Congress has the power to set tariffs and regulate global trade.”

The resolution was widely viewed as a symbolic gesture since it was unlikely to have gained traction in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and would ultimately be subject to Trump’s veto power.

“It’s still a debate worth having, because, you know, if a month from now, we have massive tariffs go on, and we have a massive sell off in the stock market, and we didn’t have a first good quarter in growth, and if it’s worse again in the second quarter, people would start asking, ‘Is it good policy, or is it a bad policy?’” Paul, who co-sponsored the resolution, said of the failed vote.

Trump has played down fears that his sweeping tariffs, including a 145 percent duty on China, could tip the US into recession.

The US Department of Commerce on Wednesday reported that the economy contracted 0.3 percent during the first three months of the year, a period that occurred before Trump imposed his steepest tariffs.

The agreement with the UK marks Trump’s first trade deal since he imposed tariffs on dozens of countries onApril 2, a date he called “Liberation Day”. Separately, Trump has introduced bespoke tariffs on certain US imports, includingcarsandsteel.

Trump has long accused other countries of exploiting the US on trade, casting his tariffs as necessary to bring jobs back to the US. He also wants to use tariffs to finance future tax cuts.

Until now, most imports from the UK to the US have faced ablanket 10 percent tariff. The UK, like other countries, was also hit with 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium exports to the US, as well as a 25 percent tariff on cars and car parts.

Under the new agreement, US tariffs on UK goods will be set at 10 percent while tariffs on UK steel and aluminium will be reduced to zero. The 10 percent rate is still much higher than the 2.5 percent tariffs on cars under the administration of former US President Joe Biden. The deal will raise $6bn in revenues for the US and create $5bn in new export opportunities, the White House said.

The UK has agreed to lower tariffs on US goods to 1.8 percent from 5.1 percent and to provide greater access in UK markets for US goods. It has also agreed to purchase $10bn of Boeing BA.N planes, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the White House on Thursday during the trade deal announcement.

Starmer said the deal delivered on his promise to protect British carmakers and the steel sector. “All of these tariff cuts will come into place as soon as possible,” Starmer said following his phone call with Trump.

The deal will also create an aluminium and steel-trading zone and secure the pharmaceutical supply chain, Trump wrote in a social media post as the deal was announced at the White House.

The UK has not been forced to drop its 2 percent digital services tax on US tech firms, as was previously expected.

A UK government statement said: “The Digital Services Tax remains unchanged as part of today’s deal. Instead, the two nations have agreed to work on a digital trade deal that will strip back paperwork for British firms trying to export to the US – opening the UK up to a huge market that will put rocket boosters on the UK economy.”

While both governments will likely present the agreement announced today as a significant win, it is essentially about returning to the status quo – removing the newly imposed tariff barriers.

It remains to be seen how much any agreement will contribute to both countries’ economic output.

In 2023, the UK had an overall trade surplus with the US. The UK reported a surplus of 71.4 billion pounds ($95bn) in goods and services. Most of that headroom came from services, however.

On the goods side, the UK exported 15.3 percent of its goods to the US in 2023 – amounting to roughly 60 billion pounds ($80bn).

Machinery and transport equipment accounted for the largest share, at 27 billion pounds ($36bn), ahead of chemicals at 14 billion pounds ($19bn).

On the flipside, the US exported 58 billion pounds ($77.2bn) of goods to the UK in 2023. Ten percent of all goods imported by the UK came from the US in that year, second only to Germany.

Machinery and transport equipment accounted for the largest share, worth nearly 20 billion pounds ($27bn), followed by fuel – amounting to 18.7 billion pounds ($25bn).

On the services side, the US exported 102 billion pounds ($76bn) in services – things like advertising and banking – to the UK in 2023, and imported 127 billion pounds $170bn in British services. These are unaffected by tariffs.

Trump cautioned that the agreement, with its preservation of a 10 percent tariff, was not a template for other countries. “That’s a low number,” Trump said.

Trump’s top negotiating officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trade partners since the president’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement on April 2.

Although Trump delayed implementing “reciprocal” tariffs for most countries by90 dayson April 9, he did raise them for China to 145 percent.Beijing, in turn, slapped a 125 percent tariff on US goods.

The reciprocal tariffs, which varied from 10 percent to 39 percent, were designed to hit countries with which Washington has large trade deficits, or that impose heavy tariffs on US goods.

On Tuesday, Trump said he would review potential trade agreements over the next two weeks to decide which ones to accept. Last week, he said that “we [already] have potential trade deals” with South Korea and Japan.

Following his 90-day reprieve, steep reciprocal tariffs are due to be imposed on US trade partners in early July, leaving country representatives racing to avoid a full-blown trade spat with the world’s number-one economy.







According todatafrom the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the total goods trade between the US and China stood at an estimated $582.4bn in 2024.

US exports of goods to China totalled $143.5bn while US imports from China totalled $438.9bn. The upshot is that the US trade deficit with China was $295.4bn last year, 5.8 percent higher ($16.3bn) than in 2023.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will meet with China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland this weekend for talks, which may be the first step inresolving a trade warbetween the world’s two largest economies.

Meetingswill take place in Geneva, and are expected to address reductions on broad tariffs, duties on specific products, export controls and Trump’s decision to end “de minimis” exemptions on low-value imports.

China’s Commerce Ministry said last week that it was “evaluating” an offer from Washington. The Geneva meeting will be the first between the two countries since the announcement of Trump’s trade tariffs in April.

On Tuesday, Bessent told Fox News, “We [the US and China] have a shared interest that isn’t sustainable. And 145 percent and 125 percent is the equivalent of an embargo. We don’t want to decouple. What we want is fair trade.”

Trump has accused China of manipulating its currency to make its exports cheaper. He has also slammed Beijing for adopting what he says are market-interfering practices, such as direct government support for Chinese companies, as well as tax breaks and preferential financing.







In 2023, the European Union exported 502 billion euros ($563bn) worth of goods to the US and in turn imported 344 billion euros ($386bn) of goods, amounting to a goods trade surplus in the EU’s favour of 157 billion euros ($177bn).

After Trump temporarily dropped his 20 percent reciprocal tariffs on the EU in April, the EU paused retaliatory duties on 21 billion euros ($24bn) of US goods until July 14, including on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, chicken and clothing.

Since then, Brussels has said it wants to increase US goods imports by 50 billion euros ($57bn) to address the “problem” in their trade relationship.

Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s top negotiator, recently told The Financial Times that the bloc is making “progress” towards striking a deal.

But Sefcovic suggested that the EU would not accept an indefinite 10 percent tariff on its exports as a fair resolution to trade talks. He added that his “ambition” was still to strike a “balanced and fair” deal with the White House.

He also said he wants his US counterparts to take into account US services that are exported to the EU.

The EU experienced a services trade deficit of 109 billion euros ($123bn) with the US in 2023 in terms of services. Brussels exported 319 billion euros ($361bn) in services to the US that year, while importing 427 billion euros ($483bn).

Taking this into account would bring the US overall trade deficit with the EU to about 50 billion euros ($57bn), he said.

The new $57bn US deficit could be closed quickly, Sefcovic added, with deals to purchase more US gas and agricultural products. Talks are currently continuing.

In the first three months of 2025, India exported $27.7bn of goods (mainly pharmaceutical and engineering products) to the US, while importing $10.5bn of goods (mainly aircraft and medical goods), meaning a US trade deficit of $17.2bn.

On Tuesday, Trump revealed that India had agreed to drop all tariffs on US imports “to nothing”. New Delhi has not yet issued an official statement confirming Trump’s remarks.

At a White House event alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump said, “India has one of the highest tariffs in the world. We are not going to put up with that. They have agreed to drop it to … nothing. They wouldn’t have done that for anybody else but me.”

According to Bloomberg, India has reportedly proposed eliminating tariffs on select US imports – including steel, car parts and pharmaceuticals – as part of ongoing bilateral trade talks with Washington.

India currently imposes tariffs on US imports ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent, depending on the product category.

tariffs,"Global alarm, condemnation as Trump tariffs hit Mexico, Canada and China","A barrage of condemnation has rained down on United States President Donald Trump following his decision toimpose stiff tariffson imports from neighbouring countries, Mexico and Canada, as well as its largest supplier of goods, China.

Sunday saw no pause in the expression of criticism on the US leader, a day after he signed three separate executive orders, imposing 25 percent on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10 percent on all imports from China.

Trump has justified hissweeping decision, citing a national emergency of fentanyl and “illegal” immigration pouring into the world’s largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP).







Reactions from Mexico, Canada and China were the most immediate, as well as a raft of other nations, groups and organisations:

President Claudia Sheinbaum ordered retaliatory tariffs against Trump’s decision. In a lengthy post on X, she said her government sought dialogue rather than confrontation with its top trade partner to the north, but that Mexico had been forced to respond in kind.

“I’ve instructed my economy minister to implement the Plan B we’ve been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico’s interests,” Sheinbaum posted, without specifying what US goods her government will target.

Sheinbaum also rejected as “slander” the White House’s allegation thatdrug cartelshave an alliance with the Mexican government, a point Trump’s administration used to justify the tariffs.

The Mexican president also spoke to Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a call on Saturday, where they agreed to “continue working together in areas of common interest”, according to a read-out from Canada.







Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on X that Trump’s tariffs were a “flagrant violation” of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

“It is one of the heaviest attacks Mexico has received in its independent history. It is not admissible, it cannot be accepted, a unilateral decision of such magnitude … We are all going to lose, they will too,” Ricardo Monreal, the governing party congressional leader, said.

The US is by far Mexico’s most important foreign market. Mexico overtook China as the top destination for US exports in 2023. Almost a third of Mexico’s GDP depends directly on exports to the US, economic analyst Gabriela Siller wrote on X.

US exports to Mexico accounted for more than $322bn in 2023, Census Bureau data showed, while the US imported more than $475bn worth of Mexican products.

Mexico has been preparing possible retaliatory tariffs – ranging from 5 percent to 20 percent – on pork, cheese, fresh produce, manufactured steel and aluminium, according to sources familiar with the matter. The auto industry would initially be exempt, they said.

Trudeau announcedretaliatory measures, with 25 percent levies on a raft of US imports, including beer, wine and bourbon, as well as fruits and fruit juices, including orange juice from Trump’s home state of Florida.

Canada would also target goods, including clothing, sport equipment and household appliances. Some of those tariffs will take effect on Tuesday, the same day as Trump’s tariffs.

Trudeau said the coming weeks would be difficult for Canadians but that Americans would also suffer from Trump’s actions.

“Tariffs against Canada will put your jobs at risk, potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities,” Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa.

“They will raise costs for you, including food at the grocery store and gas at the pump.”







The 9,000km (5,600-mile) US-Canada border handles more than $2.5bn in trade a day, especially in energy and manufacturing, according to Canadian government data from 2023.

“An attack of this magnitude, Canadians will demand that their government respond. I hope Americans understand right now that in Canada there’s a lot of anger. We are supposed to be the United States’s closest ally, and folks are trying to wrap their heads around why this is happening,” said Lana Payne, head of Unifor, representing Canadian autoworkers.

British Columbia Premier David Eby said Trump’s tariffs are a “complete betrayal of the historic bond between our countries and a declaration of economic war against a trusted ally”.

“As British Columbians, and as Canadians, we will stand strong and united in the face of this unprecedented attack,” he said.

Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford said Canada “now has no choice but to hit back and hit back hard”.

“As premier of Ontario, the federal government has my full support for a strong and forceful response that matches US tariffs dollar for dollar. Canada has so much of what America needs: high-grade nickel and other critical minerals, energy and electricity, uranium, potash, aluminium. We need to maximise our points of leverage and use them to maximum effect. The federal government needs to also pursue every legal route to challenge these unfair, unjustified and illegal tariffs,” he said.

China’s finance and commerce ministries denounced Trump’s decision while leaving the door open for talks to avoid a deepening conflict.

The ministries said Beijing will challenge the decision before the World Trade Organization and take unspecified “countermeasures”. The  Ministry of Commerce said the tariff “seriously violates” international trade rules, urging the US to “engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation”.

But their response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had markedChina’s trade showdownwith Trump in his first term as president.







China’s sharpest pushback on Sunday was over fentanyl, which Beijing has been urging the US to crack down.

“Fentanyl is America’s problem,” the Ministry of Finance said. “The Chinese side has carried out extensive anti-narcotics cooperation with the United States and achieved remarkable results.”

Meanwhile, Zhiwei Zhang, an expert on the Chinese economy, said Trump’s action was “not a big shock to China’s economy”, adding that it was “unlikely to change the market expectation on China’s macro outlook”.

The EU, which has itself been threatened with tariffs by Trump, said that it “regrets” the US decision to impose tariffs.

“Tariffs create unecessary economic disruption and drive inflation,” a spokesperson for the European Commission said. “They are hurtful to all sides.”

The spokesperson said that, while the EU was “not aware of any additional tariffs being imposed on EU products”, it would “respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods”.

The EU backs free trade and low tariffs to “drive growth and economic stability within a strong, rules-based trading system”, the spokesperson added, before saying that there was “a lot at stake”.

Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said Japan, a leading US trade partner, was “deeply concerned about how these tariffs could affect the world’s economy”.

He stressed on Sunday the need to “thoroughly assess” foreign exchange movements and the outlook of monetary policy in the US, Tokyo-based Kyodo News reported.

“We will have to closely look at how Japan would be particularly affected and take the necessary steps [in response],” Kato was quoted as saying.

Other politicians, analysts and business groups also weighed in.

Acting President Choi Sang-mok has ordered government agencies to closely monitor any effect of Trump’s tariff on South Korean companies and the country’s economy, according to the official Yonhap news agency.

South Korean companies such as Samsung, LG and others with a production base in Mexico had been bracing for the US tariffs.

Yonhap quoted CFO Park Soon-cheol as saying Samsung Electronics had been assessing “potential opportunities and risks from the altering geopolitical landscape, including the US presidential election”.

LG Electronics is also considering manufacturing its refrigerators and TVs at its washing machine and dryer manufacturing plant in Tennessee in the central region of the US as part of efforts to evade tariffs, Yonhap quoted company officials.

The home appliances maker currently operates TV, refrigerator and vehicle components manufacturing plants in Mexico.

The US Senate minority leader says the new tariffs are likely to drive up costs for American consumers.

“You’re watching the Super Bowl next week. Wait till Trump’s tariffs raise your pizza prices,” the Democratic senator wrote on X.

“You’re worried about car prices. Wait till Trump’s Canada tariffs raise your car prices.”

“Energy markets are highly integrated, and free and fair trade across our borders is critical for delivering affordable, reliable energy to US consumers. We will continue to work with the Trump administration on full exclusions that protect energy affordability for consumers, expand the nation’s energy advantage and support American jobs.”

“We continue to believe that vehicles and parts that meet the USMCA’s stringent domestic and regional content requirements should be exempt from the tariff increase. Our American automakers, who invested billions in the US to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/2/global-alarm-condemnation-as-trump-tariffs-hit-mexico-canada-and-china
tariffs,Trump’s tariffs: A simple illustrated guide to 15 economic terms to know,"Throughout the past few weeks, United States President Donald Trump has announced a series of tariff policies, with shifting statements that have led to growing concerns about global economic instability.

With Trump’s tariffs affecting nearly every country, many terms have been thrown around to describe the potential results.









From trade wars to stock market drops, this article explains, in simple terms with illustrations, what these key terms mean, including those that may become more important in the coming months.

Tariffs are simply taxes imposed at the border by one country on the goods of a foreign country. They are usually aimed to protect local businesses from foreign competition.



A trade war occurs when, for example, two countries dispute trade practices and one country places extra tariffs on goods from another that it believes is engaging in unfair trade practices. The other country retaliates with tariffs and this tit-for-tat continues, thus escalating into a trade war.

It’s like an economic tug-of-war where both sides keep pulling harder instead of finding a way to agree.

A good example is the US-China trade war, which has been in effect since 2018 when the US first placed tariffs on Chinese goods. More recently, the tit-for-tat between Washington and Beijing has seen tariffs on China rise to 145 percent.

A trade deficit occurs when a country buys (imports) more goods than it sells (exports), meaning the demand for foreign goods is greater than the supply of its own products.

For example, the US has a trade deficit with China because it buys more goods from China, like electronics and clothing, than it sells to it.

Atrade surplusis the opposite. This happens when a country sells more goods than it buys.

For example, the US has a trade surplus with The Netherlands because it sells more goods, like machinery and agricultural products, to the Netherlands than it buys from it.



Subsidies are financial support or money given by the government to help local businesses or industries, making their products cheaper or more competitive.

For example, following Trump’s 25 percent tariff on all foreign automobiles and auto parts, South Korea announced emergency support for its auto sector by raising electric vehicles subsidies to boost demand.



The stock market is a place where shares of companies and other financial instruments are bought and sold. For example, if you buy Amazon shares, you’re owning part of the company, and the stock’s value can go up or down, meaning you can make or lose money.

An index is a way to measure how a group of stocks is performing.

In the US, three of the biggest indices are:



The Fed (short for the Federal Reserve) is the central bank of the United States.

It helps control the country’s money supply, sets interest rates, and tries to keep the economy stable – more on these later.



Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage.

For example, when the Fed raises interest rates, borrowing money becomes more expensive, and when it lowers rates, borrowing money becomes cheaper.

Interest rates go up when central banks want to slow inflation or cool down an overheating economy.



Inflation measures how quickly the price of things rises over time. This means that money doesn’t buy as much as it used to.

For example, if a sandwich cost $2.50 a year ago and now the same sandwich costs $3.00 then the inflation rate for the sandwich is 20 percent.

Inflation can occur when demand for a product is higher than supply, or when it costs more to make the product. It can also occur if there’s too much money in the economy, like when a country prints more cash.

The Fed tries to keep inflation steady. If prices rise too fast, it can hurt the economy by making goods and services too expensive. The Fed changes interest rates to help keep prices under control.



The exchange rate is the value of one country’s money compared to another’s.

For example, one US dollar will get you about 0.90 euros.

Exchange rates are important because they affect the cost of buying and selling goods between countries.

A strong currency makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive, while a weak currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive. The rates also affect travel, investments and global business.



Market trends are the general direction in which prices or markets are moving over time – going up, down, or staying stable.

They help investors and businesses understand what’s happening in the economy.

Economists use terms like “bull” and “bear” market to refer to these trends.

Economists often use a formula based on the S&P 500 to determine if we’re in a bull or bear market, with a 20 percent change from the last high as the key threshold.



Debt is the money a government owes to another, usually with the agreement to pay it back later with interest.

For example, if the US needs money for things like healthcare or defence, it might borrow from China by selling US Treasury bonds.

A bond is like a loan where you lend money in exchange for interest and repayment later.

China buys these bonds, lending money to the US, which promises to pay it back with interest over time. This lets the US get the money quickly without raising taxes or cutting spending.



​As of March 2025, the US national debt stands at approximately $36.56 trillion. This substantial debt level has raised concerns about the nation’s fiscal health and its ability to manage future financial obligations.

Trade agreements are deals between countries that make it easier to buy and sell goods.

For example:



GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific period, usually a year or a quarter. It is used to measure the size and health of a country’s economy.



A recession is when the economy becomes weaker for a period of time.

A recession is typically identified when a country’s GDP declines for two consecutive quarters (six months).

During a recession, several things usually happen:

Since 1950, the US has had 11recessions.



Trade policies refer to government policies that govern the exchange of goods and services between countries.

Broadly speaking, there are two opposing views on how countries should engage in global trade.

tariffs,US “reciprocal tariffs” will ultimately backfire,"On April 2, the United States announced it would implement “reciprocal tariffs” on its trading partners, including a 34 percent tariff on China and rates ranging from 10 to 39 percent on Arab countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Iraq.

The move triggered widespread discontent both around the world and within the US. The so-called “reciprocal tariffs” are unlikely to achieve the stated goal of “rebalancing trade”. Instead, they risk pushing the US economy – and potentially the global economy – into recession.









The imposition of “reciprocal tariffs” by the US poses a serious challenge to the existing international trade and economic order. The US claimed it had suffered losses in international trade and was using “reciprocity” as a justification to raise tariffs. This approach disregards the balance of interests achieved through years of multilateral trade negotiations and ignores the fact that the US has long reaped substantial benefits from international trade.

The so-called “reciprocal tariffs”, determined based on unilateral and subjective assessments, violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, severely undermine the legitimate rights and interests of relevant parties, and pose a grave threat to the rules-based multilateral trading system.

The “reciprocal tariffs” are set to undermine the stable functioning of the global economy. According topreliminary estimatesby the WTO, the tariff measures introduced by the US since the beginning of this year could lead to an overall contraction of approximately 1 percent in global merchandise trade in 2025 – a significant downward revision from previous forecasts.

The tariff measures implemented by the US threaten the stability of global industrial and supply chains, cast uncertainty over the future of economic globalisation, and could severely disrupt the circulation of the world economy, with the potential to trigger a global economic and financial crisis.

The “reciprocal tariffs” will ultimately backfire. The European Union, Canada, and others have stated their intention to implement countermeasures against the US. The Budget Lab at Yale University has predicted that if other countries enact full tit-for-tat retaliation, US consumer prices will increase by 2.1 percent, while the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate will decline by 1 percent.

Currently, consumer confidence in the US is steadily declining, and these “reciprocal tariffs” will further raise household spending on goods, increasing the financial burden on American families. They will also raise manufacturing costs, weaken the competitiveness of US businesses, and eventually push the US economy towards recession.

The trade and tariff wars have no winners. Protectionism leads nowhere. The tariff hikes, made under the pretext of reciprocity, represent a typical act of unilateral bullying that benefits no one.

China firmly rejects this move and will do what is necessary to defend our legitimate rights and interests. We urge the US to stop doing the wrong thing and resolve trade differences with China and other countries through consultation with equality, respect and mutual benefit.

tariffs,"Trump’s 100-day scorecard: Executive orders, tariffs and foreign policy","United States President Donald Trump is marking his first 100 days back in office with a rally in Macomb County, Michigan, just north of Detroit, a city renowned for its automotive industry.

In the space of just more than three months, he has signed more executive orders than any other president, sent markets spiralling with tariffs and for the most part stuck to his America First policy, except when it comes to Israel.









Al Jazeera looks at some of his biggest decisions in numbers:

Trump has signed at least 142executive ordersso far, which, according to the American Presidency Project, is more than any other US president in their first 100 days in office.

An executive order is a directive issued by the president to federal agencies that has the force of law but does not require congressional approval.

On January 20, his first day in office, Trump signed 26 orders, which included pardoning more than 1,500 people convicted on January 6, 2021, Capitol riot charges; withdrawing from the World Health Organization; and renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.

The majority of Trump’s executive orders have focused on immigration and border security as well as energy and trade.



Since returning to office, Trump haspardonedmore than 1,500 people, including his supporters convicted in connection with the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot after he lost the 2020 presidential election. Other notable pardons include Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road dark web marketplace, who was serving a sentence for drug trafficking and money laundering.



Tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was created by Trump through an executive order on January 20, in which he gave DOGE a mandate to slash government spending.

According to figures published onDOGE’s website, the organisation is estimating that it has cut $160bn from the federal budget, representing about 8 percent of the $2 trillion Musk had initially pledged to save.

DOGE said the biggest cuts have been made to the Department of Health and Human Services ($47.4bn), Agency for International Development ($45.2bn) and Department of State ($2.6bn). These figures have, however, been criticised for lacking sufficient evidence to back them up.



According to data collated byCNN, at least 121,000 workers have been fired from federal agencies with about 10,000 employees fired from the Agency for International Development (USAID), where 100 percent of the jobs were culled. USAID was the first agency Trump went after, and it has now been almost dissolved.







Trump’s administration has implemented a flurry of tariffs to, in his words, reduce the US trade deficit, remedy unfair trade policies against the US, bring manufacturing jobs back to the country and generate income for the US government.

Starting on February 1, Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs onCanadian and Mexicangoods, including a 10 percent levy on Canadian energy, and hit Chinese goods with a 10 percent tariff.

In the weeks that followed, Trump targeted steel and aluminium as well as auto imports with tariffs of 25 percent. By April, Trump had placed a baseline 10 percent tariff on goods imported from the rest of the world.





Chinareceived the highest tariff rate at 145 percent. However, some exemptions have been applied to technology-related items, such as smartphones.

Canada and Mexico are facing tariffs of 25 percent on goods that are noncompliant with the trilateral USMCA trade deal they have with the US, affecting $63.8bn worth of trade, according to Bloomberg News.

TheEuropean Unionis facing what is for now a suspended 20 percent tariff rate.

Since coming into office, Trump has sentshockwavesthrough the markets, largely due to his flip-flopping tariff announcements, which have caused uncertainty and volatility.

Since the November election, despite an initial spike, all major indices have fallen:

Since inauguration day, the markets have fallen even further:



In his first 100 days in office, Trump has hosted at least 11 world leaders.

Unsurprisingly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was the first leader to arrive at the White House on February 4. It was during this visit that Trump said he would turn Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.

World leaders who have visited Trump include:

Since entering office, Trump has said he maintains an America First policy.

On Ukraine, Trump has criticised the scale of US spending under former President Joe Biden, arguing that European countries should shoulder a greater share of the burden. On March 3, Trump ceased all military aid to Ukraine, a move that drew sharp criticism from European allies. The Trump administration has held several meetings with Ukrainian and Russian officials to try to end the fighting.

In the Middle East, Trump has brandished proposals to take control of Gaza and redevelop it, an idea widely condemned for implying the ethnic cleansing of 2.3 million Palestinians. At the same time, his administration has continued sending US bombs to Israel, including 900kg (2,000lb) bombs, reinforcing unwavering US support for Israel.

Since Trump’s inauguration on January 20, Israeli forces havekilledat least 2,392 people in Gaza and 105 in the occupied West Bank. Additionally, about 3,000 people have either died from wounds sustained in Israeli attacks or were pulled dead from beneath the rubble.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, the US has significantly increased its military actions in Yemen with attacks on Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Operation Rough Rider began on March 15, whose stated aim is stemming Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping.

From March 15 to April 18, at least 207 US attacks were recorded in Yemen, resulting in at least 209 deaths, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).



During his 2024 election campaign, Trump made at least 75 promises, which included everything from mass deportations to releasing the 2021 Capitol Hillrioters.

PolitiFact, an American nonprofit project operated by the Poynter Institute that fact-checks news statements, has been tracking Trump’s promises with its MAGA-Meter. According to its scorecard, Trump has kept six of his promises, broken one, stalled on four and is working on fulfilling 23.

tariffs,"Vietnam, US kick off trade talks as Hanoi seeks relief from Trump’s tariffs","Vietnam and the United States have kicked off trade talks, the Vietnamese government has said, as Hanoi scrambles to avoid a crippling 46 percent tariff announced by US President Donald Trump.

Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien and US Trade Representative Jamieson L Greer held a phone call to officially initiate their negotiations on “bilateral economic and trade issues”, Vietnam’s trade ministry said on Thursday.

Nguyen told Greer that Vietnam wants to develop a “comprehensive strategic partnership” with the US and promote “economic and trade relations in a balanced, stable, sustainable, and effective manner”, the ministry said.

“He noted that Vietnamese ministries and agencies are ready to negotiate solutions to issues of US concern and work together with the US to find reasonable solutions that benefit both sides, based on the spirit of harmonized interests and shared risks,” the ministry said, adding that Greer expressed confidence that the two sides “would soon reach suitable solutions to foster stable and mutually beneficial economic and trade relations.”

Vietnam is one of the world’s most trade-dependent economies, with its exports in 2023 accounting for more than 87 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), according to the World Bank.

Trump’s 46 percent tariff on Vietnamese exports is among the highest tax rate imposed on a trading partner under his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs.

Since Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his steepest tariffs on April 9, Vietnamese exports, like those from dozens of other countries, have been subject to a baseline duty of 10 percent.

tariffs,‘Nothing is off the table’: World leaders react to Trump’s tariffs,"Broad,hard-hitting tariffsannounced by United States President Donald Trump have triggeredglobal alarmand retaliatory threats from key allies, with analysts warning they could push the US and other countries towards a recession.

Still, many US trade partners responded cautiouslyto the levies– which range from a baseline 10 percent to 49 percent – showing a reluctance to escalate into a full-scale trade war with the world’s largest economy.

“This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy,” said Olu Sonola, Fitch Ratings’ head of US Economic Research, in a report. “You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.”







Here’s how US allies, other countries, business groups, and experts are responding:

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, responding to a new 20 percent tariff on the EU, called the measure a “major blow to the world economy”.

“The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe,” she said, adding groceries, transport and medicine will cost more. “And this is hurting, in particular, the most vulnerable citizens.”

Von der Leyen acknowledged that the world trading system has “serious deficiencies” and said the EU was ready to negotiate with the US but also was prepared to respond with countermeasures.

German chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the recent tariffs decision by the US President is in his view “fundamentally wrong and it is an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world, itself an American achievement.”

“We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision,” he said.

Speaking later he added: “It’s perfectly obvious: even if Europe did nothing at all, it would lead to economic difficulties for the U.S. All this is basic economics that we have been able to read about in the textbooks on trade wars for 100 years.”

French prime minister Francis Bayrou said because of the tariffs “it’s an immense difficulty for Europe.”

“I think it’s also a catastrophe for the United States and for US citizens.”

Irish prime minister Michael Martin called the decision by the US “deeply regrettable.”

“I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy.”

Italy’s prime minister Georgia Meloni said: “We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the goal of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favour of other global players.”

The Spanish government will implement a 14.1-billion-euro ($15.66 billion) plan to cushion the impact of the new US tariffs on the Spanish economy, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.

“This tariff attack by the US administration makes no distinction between friends and enemies, it doesn’t discriminate based on ideology or trade balance; it’s against everyone and everything,” Sanchez said.

He added that he was also asking the European Commission to set up a fund financed by revenues from tariffs on imports from the United States that will be increased in response to the move that he said was unfriendly and unjustified.

Finland’s President Alexander Stubb has o that all of Europe should engage with the United States on the issue of trade tariffs.

“My recommendation to all my European partners is to engage with the American administration, he said. “Engagement is the key,” he added.

Swedish trade minister Ulf Kristersson said the country does not want “growing trade barriers.”

“We don’t want a trade war … We want to find our way back to a path of trade and cooperation together with the US, so that people in our countries can enjoy a better life.”

The UK played it diplomatically, declaring that the US remains its “closest ally” despite a new 10 percent tariff on British goods.

Secretary of State for Business and Trade Jonathan Reynolds said the UK sought a trade deal to “mitigate the impact” of the tariff. “Nobody wants a trade war and our intention remains to secure a deal,” he said. “But nothing is off the table and the government will do everything necessary to defend the UK’s national interest.”

Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter said the country’s Federal Council will quickly determine the next steps.

“The country’s long-term economic interests are paramount. Adherence to international law and free trade remain core values.”

The closest US ally in Asia said the 24 percent tariff on it is “extremely regrettable” and may break World Trade Organization rules and the two countries’ trade agreement.

“I have again strongly urged (Washington) not to apply them [the tariffs] to Japan,” Yoji Muto, trade and industry minister, told reporters.

Asked if Japan will impose retaliatory tariffs or is considering filing a suit to the WTO, government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said: “We decline to disclose details of our considerations.”

Al Jazeera’s Fadi Salameh, reporting from Tokyo, said the tariffs will deal a heavy blow to the auto industry that the country will struggle to respond to.

The Ministry of Commerce, reeling from a 34 percent tariff on top of the20 percent already imposed earlier this year, said China would “resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests”, without saying exactly what it might do.

“China urges the United States to immediately cancel its unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through equal dialogue,” it said.

Bill Bishop, an analyst and commentator on China affairs, said the US should expect a swift response from China, including more export controls on critical minerals and inquiries into US firms. Beijing may also make a “larger than expected devaluation” of its currency against the US dollar to offset the cost of the new tariffs, Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter.

India has it was “examining the implications” of the new tariffs announced by Trump and trying to see “opportunities” in them, as its Asian competitors were hit harder by the tariffs announced the day before.

“Negotiations are underway between the Indian and US trade teams to expeditiously conclude a mutually beneficial, multi-sector bilateral trade agreement,” India’s commerce ministry added in a statement.

Sri Lanka’s apparel manufacturing industry has warned that sweeping US tariffs will disrupt the island’s largest export sector and place thousands of jobs at risk.

“The tariff level is extremely high relative to our regional competitors,” said Yohan Lawrence, head of the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF), referring to a 44 percent tariff imposed by US President Trump on Sri Lankan goods.

JAAF said in a statement the tariff hike could “significantly disrupt” the garment industry and threatened “thousands of jobs”.

“Our focus now is on engagement, agility, and ensuring Sri Lanka remains a trusted sourcing destination,” Lawrence said, adding that the government had appointed a committee to study the impact of the new tariffs.

Acting President Han Duck-soo called for talks with US officials to shield the export-reliant economy from the effect of the 25 percent tariff and ordered emergency support measures for businesses.

Han asked the industry minister to analyse the content of the tariffs and actively negotiate with Washington to minimise the effect, a ministry statement said.

“As the global trade war has become a reality, the government must pour all its capabilities to overcome the trade crisis,” Han said.

Al Jazeera’s Jessica Washington, reporting from Seoul, said “hundreds of small and medium enterprises will be affected”.

“But at the moment it does seem South Korea believes there is a path forward involving negotiation,” she said.

Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese said: “The (Trump) administration’s tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership.”

“This is not the act of a friend. Today’s decision will add to uncertainty in the global economy and it will push up costs for American households,” he added.

Trade minister Todd Mcclay said: “New Zealand’s interests are best served in a world where trade flows freely … New Zealand’s bilateral relationship with the U.S. remains strong. We will be talking with the administration to get more information, and our exporters to better understand the impact this announcement will have.”

The government of Latin America’s largest economy said it was “evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization”, following Trump’s 10 percent tariff.

Earlier in the day, Brazil’s Congress approved a bill that establishes a legal framework for Brazil to respond to potential unilateral trade measures targeting its goods and services, including countermeasures such as tariffs.

Colombian president Gustavo Petro said: “We will only make U.S. imports more expensive if they take away our jobs. But we won’t raise tariffs if their goods help create higher-value jobs.”







As US stock futures and Japan’s stock index dropped, market analysts warned of severe disruption from tariff hikes reaching levels unseen in more than a century.

“The magnitude of the rollout — both in scale and speed — wasn’t just aggressive; it was a full-throttle macro disruption,” said global market strategist Stephen Innes.

“The [average] US tariff rate on all imports is now around 22 percent, from 2.5 percent in 2024. That rate was last seen around 1910,” added Sonola, of Fitch Ratings. “Many countries will likely end up in a recession.”

The pain is likely to be especially intense in Asia Pacific nations, with the highest tariffs for impoverished, financially precarious countries like Laos at a 48 percent tariff, Cambodia at 49 percent and Myanmar at 44 percent.

“An export-dependent region is going to really struggle with sudden huge price increases. The damage to poorer countries is particularly cruel,” Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera.







While some US trade representatives welcomed the protection for domestic industries, others expressed concern that higher costs could squeeze already tight margins for manufacturers and drive up prices for consumers.

“The high costs of new tariffs threaten investment, jobs, supply chains and, in turn, America’s ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the pre-eminent manufacturing superpower,” said Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.

Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said the measures prioritise US manufacturers and workers.

“These hardworking men and women have seen unfair trade cut the ground from beneath their feet for decades. They deserve a fighting chance,” he said in a statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/nothing-is-off-the-table-how-us-trade-partners-are-responding-to-tariffs
tariffs,China says US tariff exemptions ‘small step in correcting wrong practice’,"China has welcomed the announcement by the United States of a series ofexemptions from import levies on consumer electronics, which it said was a “small step” in correcting President Donald Trump’s “wrong practice” of imposing 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.

“China is now evaluating the impact,” a Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday, after Washington said smartphones, computers and other electronics would be excluded.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday told ABC’s This Week that smartphones, computers and some other electronics would come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors that may be imposed in a month or so.

Beijing called on Washington to “completely cancel” its reciprocal tariffs. “We urge the US to … take a big step to correct its mistakes, completely cancel the wrong practice of ‘reciprocal tariffs’ and return to the right path of mutual respect,” the Commerce Ministry statement said.

The Trump administration late on Friday granted exclusions from steep tariffs on electronics, imported largely from China, providing a big break to tech firms like Apple that rely on imported products.

The move came as retaliatory Chinese import tariffs of 125 percent on US goods took effect on Saturday, with Beijing standing defiant against its primary trade competitor.

Washington and Beijing’s escalating tariff battle has raised fears of an enduring trade war between the world’s two largest economies and sent global markets into a tailspin.

The fallout has sent shockwaves through the US economy, with investors dumping government bonds and the dollar tumbling.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS Sunday that there are no plans yet for Trump to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump insisted on Friday on his Truth Social platform that “we are doing really well on our tariff policy”, even after Beijing announced its latest hike.

While Trump has referred to tariffs as a way to bring manufacturing back to the US, analysts say it will likely take years to ramp up domestic production.

tariffs,"Biden slaps new tariffs on Chinese imports, ratcheting trade war","President Joe Biden has slapped major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment, taking potshots at Donald Trump along the way as he embraced a strategy that’s increasing friction between the world’s two largest economies.

The Democratic president said on Tuesday that Chinese government subsidies ensure the nation’s companies do not have to turn a profit, giving them an unfair advantage in global trade.

“American workers can outwork and outcompete anyone as long as the competition is fair,” Biden said in the White House Rose Garden. “But for too long, it hasn’t been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies … it’s not competition, it’s cheating.”

China immediately promised retaliation. Its Ministry of Commerce said Beijing was opposed to the tariff hikes by the United States and would take measures to defend its interests.

Biden will keep tariffs put in place by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump while ratcheting up others, including a quadrupling of EV duties to more than 100 percent and doubling the duties on semiconductor tariffs to 50 percent.

The new measures affect $18bn in imported Chinese goods including steel and aluminium, semiconductors, electric vehicles, critical minerals, solar cells and cranes, the White House said. The EV figure, while headline-grabbing, may have more political than practical impact in the US, which imports very few Chinese EVs.

The US imported $427bn in goods from China in 2023 and exported $148bn to the world’s number-two economy, according to the US Census Bureau, a trade gap that has persisted for decades and become an ever more sensitive subject in Washington.

US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the revised tariffs were justified because China was stealing US intellectual property. But Tai recommended tariff exclusions for hundreds of industrial machinery import categories from China, including 19 for solar product manufacturing equipment.

The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between Biden and Trump, his Republican predecessor, to show who’s tougher on China.

Asked to respond to Trump’s comments that China was eating the US’s lunch, Biden said of his rival, “He’s been feeding them a long time.” The Democrat said Trump had failed to crack down on Chinese trade abuses as he had pledged he would do during his presidency.

Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s press secretary, called the new tariffs a “weak and futile attempt” to distract from Biden’s own support for EVs in the United States, which Trump says will lead to layoffs at car factories.

Administration officials said their measures are combined with domestic investment in key industries and unlikely to worsen a bout of inflation that has already angered US voters.

Biden has struggled to convince voters of the efficacy of his economic policies despite a backdrop of low unemployment and above-trend economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showed Trump had a seven percentage-point edge over Biden on the economy.

Analysts have warned that a trade tiff could raise costs for EVs overall, hurting Biden’s climate goals and his aim to create manufacturing jobs.

Biden has said he wants to win this era of competition with China but not to launch a trade war. He has worked in recent months to ease tensions in one-on-one talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Both 2024 US presidential candidates have departed from the free-trade consensus that once reigned in Washington, a period capped by China’s joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. Trump’s broader imposition of tariffs during his 2017-2021 presidency kicked off a tariff war with China.

As part of the long-awaited tariff update, Biden will increase tariffs this year from 25 percent to 100 percent on EVs, bringing total duties to 102.5 percent, from 7.5 percent to 25 percent on lithium-ion EV batteries and other battery parts and from 25 percent to 50 percent on photovoltaic cells used to make solar panels. Some critical minerals will have their tariffs raised from nothing to 25 percent.

More tariffs will follow in 2025 and 2026 on semiconductors, as well as lithium-ion batteries that are not used in electric vehicles, graphite and permanent magnets, as well as rubber medical and surgical gloves.

A number of lawmakers have called for massive hikes on Chinese vehicle tariffs or an outright ban over data privacy concerns. There are relatively few Chinese-made light-duty vehicles being imported now.

The United Auto Workers, a politically important union that endorsed Biden, said the tariff moves would ensure that “the transition to electric vehicles is a just transition.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/14/biden-slaps-new-tariffs-on-chinese-imports-ratcheting-trade-war
tariffs,China’s Xi says tariffs undermine ‘legitimate rights’ of all countries,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned that tariffs threaten the interests of all countries amid an ongoing de facto trade embargo between China and the United States.

During a meeting with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev on Wednesday, Xi said trade wars “undermine the legitimate rights and interests of all countries, hurt the multilateral trading system and impact the world economic order”, the state-run news agency Xinhua said.

“Xi said that China is willing to work with Azerbaijan to safeguard the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law, firmly protect respective legitimate rights and interests, and defend international fairness and justice,” Xinhua said.

Xi’s remarks come as trade between the world’s two largest economies is at an effective standstill following the imposition of punishing tariffs on each other’s exports.







US President Donald Trump’s administration has imposed a 145 percent tariff on most Chinese goods, with China slapping a 125 percent duty on US exports in response.

The trade war has raised fears of a global economic slowdown, with the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday revising its 2025 growth estimate from 3.3 percent to 2.8 percent.

Global stocks surged on Wednesday after comments by Trump and top administration officials raised hopes of a trade deal between Washington and Beijing.

In a speech to investors on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a trade war with China was “unsustainable” and he expected the sides to reach a deal on trade at some point.

Following Bessent’s remarks, Trump acknowledged that the tariff on Chinese goods was “very high” and said the rate would “come down substantially” in time.

“It will not be anywhere near that number,” Trump said.

On Wednesday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the door for talks was “wide open” but the Trump administration should stop making threats if it wanted to reach a deal.

“We do not wish to fight, nor are we afraid of fighting,” spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during a regular news conference, adding that “continuing to exert extreme pressure is not the correct way to have dealings with China”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/4/23/chinas-xi-says-tariffs-undermine-legitimate-rights-of-all-countries
tariffs,"China FM vows to fight Trump tariffs, says US is ‘meeting good with evil’","China’s top diplomat has declared that Beijing will “firmly counter” United States pressure after President Donald Trump heaped tariffs on Chinese goods. Foreign Minister Wang Yi also accused Washington of “meeting good with evil” for provokinga trade warbetween the world’s two largest economies.

Speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of a key political meeting in the Chinese capital on Friday, Wang warned that the “law of the jungle” could take hold in the world if nations were to pursue purely their own interests.

The US and China have been reengaging in tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs since Trump’s return to office in January. The US has imposed flat tariffs of 20 percent on all Chinese imports, and in response, China slapped additional 15 percent duties on US imports including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key US companies.

“China-US economic and trade ties are mutual,” Wang told reporters.

“If you choose to cooperate, you can achieve mutually beneficial and win-win results. If you use only pressure, China will firmly counter,” he added.

Wang also rejected Trump’s assertion that the imposition ofnew US tariffsis punishment for Beijing’s failure to help with the US fentanyl overdose crisis.

“The abuse of fentanyl is an issue that the US has to solve itself,” Wang stressed.

Touting Beijing’s cooperation in the fight against thefentanyl epidemicin the US, Wang said Washington should not “repay kindness with resentment, let alone impose tariffs without reason”.







“No country can imagine that it can suppress China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other hand,” he added.

Despite the brewing tension, Wang insisted that both countries still have “broad common interests and space for cooperation”.

However, some reports say the Trump administration may be preparing to impose even more tariffs on Beijing.

According to a report by the Reuters news agency, Washington is planning to charge fees for docking at US ports on any ship that is part of a fleet that includes Chinese-built or Chinese-flagged vessels, and will push allies to act similarly or face retaliation.

The draft executive order, dated February 27 and reviewed by Reuters, is reportedly aimed at reviving US domestic shipbuilding and weakening China’s grip on the global shipping industry.

Chinese shipbuildersaccount for more than 50 percent of all merchant vessel cargo capacity produced globally each year, up from just 5 percent in 1999, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

That gain came at the expense of shipbuilders in Japan and South Korea. US shipbuilding peaked in the 1970s and now accounts for a sliver of the industry’s output.

The US would also impose tariffs on Chinese cargo-handling equipment, according to the draft order.

The US administration and Chinese officials have yet to comment on the report.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/7/china-fm-vows-to-fight-trump-tariffs-says-us-is-meeting-good-with-evil
tariffs,Have Trump’s tariffs killed US-Africa preferential trade?,"United States President Donald Trump’s tariffs announcement on most trading partners, including several in Africa, will affect businesses and people across the continent and likely force more producers to trade with China, experts have warned.

Trump’s “Liberation Day” declaration on Wednesdaythrew markets into chaos, as the US took its strongest turn to protectionist policies since the 1930s, weakening a global trade system the US helped build and strengthen.

The tariffs,which include a baseline, universal 10 percent duty on all US imports as well as additional tariffs on “worst offender” countries like Nigeria and South Africa, will also likely override a decades-long open trade agreement that has seen African manufacturers export goods to the US duty-free and that has been credited for creating tens of thousands of jobs, analysts say.

Established in 2000, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) framework helped grow the continent’s exports of textiles, steel, and agricultural products, among others, to the US.

The AGOA was set for a second renewal this year, but is now likely to be jeopardised by Trump’s trade war, according to analysts.

Here’s what to know about how African countries were hit and what the likely effects could be:

Africa’s largest economies, Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (31 percent), were among those on Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs list — that is, countries the president said “treat us badly”.

They included those that impose high tariffs on US goods or have introduced other barriers to US trade, according to Washington. Those tariffs will take effect on April 9, while the universal tariffs begin on April 5.

Southern African countries were particularly badly hit. Lesotho, the small Southern African country that Trump claimed “ no one has heard of” last month, was hit with thehighest tariff ratesat 50 percent. The country, which carries the second-highest HIV burden of any other in the world, is still reeling from the shock of Trump’s sweeping aid cuts earlier that have gutted HIV response efforts across the region.

Other Southern African countries hit were: Madagascar (47 percent); Mauritius (40 percent); Botswana (37 percent); and Angola (32 percent).

South Africa was also earlier affected by a separate 25-percent tariff on all foreign-made cars that went into force this week. South Africa exports vehicles and parts worth $2bn to the US under the AGOA framework, according to the country’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Competition.

Here are the tariffs in excess of 10 percent imposed on other African countries:

South Africa’s government, which has been involved in a series of spats with Washington in recent weeks, was the first to respond to the tariff hikes.

In a statement on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office called the tariffs on the country “punitive” and added that they would “serve as a barrier to trade and shared prosperity.” The government also pledged to seek redress with Washington.

The Presidency has noted with concern the newly imposed tariffs on South African exports to the United States of America (USA).https://t.co/Y3YgJd7ECP

— The Presidency 🇿🇦 (@PresidencyZA)April 3, 2025



“The tariffs affirm the urgency to negotiate a new bilateral and mutually beneficial trade agreement with the US, as an essential step to secure long-term trade certainty,” the statement read.

According to the US government, South Africa charges a 60 percent tariff on US goods, while Lesotho charges 99 percent. Madagascar, the White House claimed, levies 93 percent tariffs on US goods, and Mauritius, 80 percent.

Trump and his close ally, Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, have criticised South Africa for land reform policies that they claim discriminate against the country’s white minority population. Trump has also offered citizenship to white South Africans. On Wednesday, during his announcement, Trump said, “Bad things are going on there.”

Experts say the tariffs will most significantly impact African economies that are reliant on US trade, and that they will effectively overrideAGOAprivileges. Currently, 32 African countries are eligible for the programme. Countries can be, and have been, taken off the list – such as Niger and Gabon, which lost their benefits after military coups.

The AGOA, which expires in September, grants duty-free access to more than 1,800 products from eligible sub-Saharan African countries and has formed the backbone of US-Africa trade policy for 25 years. It was renewed for 10 years in 2015. Chocolate and basket-weaving materials from Mauritius, musical instruments from Mali and nuts from Mozambique are among the products that have reached US buyers through AGOA.

While it is still officially operational, it’s unclear if the Trump administration will renew it again. Certainly, Trump’s tariff announcements “set it along the path to die”, Cheta Nwanze, lead partner at Lagos-based risk analysis firm SBM Intelligence, told Al Jazeera.

“African countries aren’t known for making firm geopolitical stances, so many of them will try to hold on to AGOA, which means it will go into zombie mode rather than dying off,” he said.

The programme has been hailed by economists for years for opening the US market to African manufacturers, although critics say its strict production and packaging requirements often favour bigger economies. Kenya’s AGOA sales, mainly textiles and apparel, went from $55m in 2001 to $603m in 2022.

South Africa and Nigeria are the top US trading partners on the continent. South Africa primarily exports precious stones, steel products, and cars (mainly from BMW South Africa) to the US. Nigeria exports crude oil and other petroleum products. In return, the US exports crude oil, electrical goods and aircraft to South Africa, and mostly vehicles and machinery to Nigeria.

Ghana (cocoa and crude), Ethiopia (coffee), and Kenya (textiles, tea) also record large volumes of trade with the US annually under the AGOA. Though not listed as “offenders”, these countries face the 10 percent universal tariffs.

Heavier tariffs would have varying but largely negative impacts on African manufacturers, analysts say, and could lead to increased living costs and a loss of jobs that would affect the general populace.

“Increased export costs would reduce competitiveness, potentially decreasing revenue and destabilising economies,” Nwanze of SBM Intelligence told Al Jazeera.

Sectors such as the agricultural and mineral extraction businesses are likely to be particularly vulnerable, he added, as most African manufacturers sell raw goods, not finished products, to the US.

Nigeria is still in the throes of a cost-of-living crisis that has led to high levels of hunger and poverty. South Africa, meanwhile, already records some of the highest levels of unemployment in the world, with an estimated six out of 10 people out of a job. Experts there had earlier estimated that a 25-percent blanket tariff would be a “worst case scenario”.

Speaking to the South African publication IOL before Trump’s announcement, Casey Sprake, an economist at South African investment firm Anchor Capital, said a 25-percent scenario could cut the country’s economic growth by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points. The country ended up with 31 percent.

In the short term, countries like South Africa appear to want to reason with Trump for more favourable terms.

In a statement earlier this week, Trade Minister Parks Tau said the country was urgently seeking a meeting with Washington. Tau noted that South Africa’s automobile exports account for only 0.99 percent of total US automobile imports and 0.27 percent of auto parts – figures he said hardly posed a threat to the US market.

In general, African nations are likely to turn to alternative trade partners, such as China, to avoid US tariffs, Nwanze added. Already, for nearly 20 years, China has overtaken the US as Africa’s top trading partner and represents one of the continent’s largest bilateral lenders.

China imports primary goods, such as crude oil, iron ore, copper, and is increasingly focusing on agricultural produce, as well. On the other hand, the country exports finished products, such as electronics, back to the continent.

The first official engagement, since the US slapped a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods, prompting a retaliatory 125 percent duty from China, began on Saturday at an undisclosed location in Geneva, Switzerland, according to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua.

A motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in the suburb of Cologny, The Associated Press news agency reported.

A diplomatic source, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon.

The trade dispute, which effectively amounts to a mutual boycott of products, was prompted by US PresidentDonald Trumplast month when he announced sweeping duties on almost every country in the world, which are now subject to a 90-day reprieve while negotiations take place.

Experts believeChinamay be looking for the same 90-day waiver as well as a reduction of the 145 percent tariff – Trump suggested that it could be reduced to 80 percent, saying in a Truth Social post on Friday that the amount “seems right”.

Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Friday that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally, adding that China would need to make concessions as well.

Bessent has said the meetings in Switzerland would focus on “de-escalation”.

“The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the … tariffs at the same time,” said Sun Yun, director of the China programme at the Washington, DC-based Stimson Center, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal.

“It cannot just be words,” she said.







Trump has justified the punitive tariff by citing unfair trade practices and accusing Beijing of failing to curb the export of chemicals used to produce fentanyl, a lethal synthetic opioid.

China, for its part, says it will not bow to “imperialists” and bullies.

With distrust running high, both sides have been keen not to appear weak, and economic analysts have low expectations of a breakthrough.

Trump has suggested the discussions were initiated by China. Beijing said the US requested the discussions and that China’s policy of opposing US tariffs had not changed.

Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin met both parties in Geneva on Friday and said the fact that the talks were taking place was already a success.

“If a roadmap can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions,” he told reporters on Friday, saying talks could continue into Sunday or even Monday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/10/us-and-chinese-officials-hold-geneva-talks-to-de-escalate-trade-war

Amazon has disputed the allegation, saying it is not planning to display any added trade charges.

At a news conference marking President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt lashed out at Amazon over news reports that suggested the company was considering displaying theadded cost of tariff dutieson its online platform.

“Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Leavitt asked.

She further attacked the company by saying that “Reuters recently wrote [that] Amazon partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm,” holding up what appeared to be a news article printout.

Though Amazon denied the White House’s allegation, its stock pricesank brieflyfollowing Leavitt’s comments before recovering again shortly afterwards.

The White House’s tirade against the retail giant is an indication of the pressure it is facing over Trump’s new tariffs –145 percentin the case of China and 10 percent on all other countries – which analysts say will lead to higher prices.

And while Amazon says it won’t proactively expose the tariffs as the reason prices are rising, other major online retailers aren’t as skittish.

On Tuesday,Punchbowl Newsreported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs – right next to the product’s total listed price,” to illustrate how Trump’s tariffs are affecting thecost of goods.

The Trump administration’s fierce reaction to the Punchbowl article appeared to be based on a misinterpretation of internal plans being considered by Amazon, rather than any final decision.

Less than an hour after Leavitt’s news briefing, Amazon issued a statement saying that, though one of its teams had discussed “the idea of listing import charges on certain products,” it was “never a consideration for the main Amazon site”.

Only Amazon’s Haul service – its recently launched, low-cost storefront – “considered the idea” of listing import charges on certain products, a company spokesperson told The Associated Press news agency. But he said this “is not going to happen”.

The AP also reported that Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain about the reported plans on Tuesday morning. The administration seemed to change its tune after the conversation.

“Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters before leaving the White House for Michigan on Tuesday afternoon. “He solved a problem very quickly and he did the right thing. He’s a good guy.”

Trump’s tariffs – and the retaliatory responses from targeted countries,notably China– threaten to increase prices for online retailers and, by extension, American consumers. Amazon won’t be spared.

Amazon’s United States revenues topped $600bn last year. Its core business offering is to charge third-party sellers to use its website, and then leverage those commissions to fund its vast delivery infrastructure.

In 2024, 83 percent of US households shopped with Amazon. The retail giant has, in recent years, adjusted its focus from selling big-ticket items like TVs and gaming consoles to everyday goods like laundry detergent and toilet paper.

Revenues, in turn, have gone up. In 2023, Amazon processed 5.9 billion delivery orders in the US, a whopping 15.7 percentage point increase in a single year. Its share of the US parcel market also rose by 16.3 percentage points from 2022 levels.

In the US, Amazon makes roughly 40 percent of e-commerce sales. Its business model relies heavily on third-party merchants, many of whom are based in China – they can offer bargain prices due to low manufacturing and regulatory costs.

A staggering 71 percent of the goods sold by Amazon in the US are manufactured in China, according to a 2024 survey by Jungle Scout. For context, that’s 2.5 times more than the number of products sourced from the US.

Third-party sellers are now faced with a choice of either raising prices or absorbing the extra costs of Trump’s tariffs. It’s an existential threat for many merchants, who subsist on razor-thin margins. E-commerce is going to take a hit.

Numerous online retailers have decried Trump’s trade moves. Several big-name companies including Amazon’s rivals Temu and Shein have already raised prices while specifically pointing to the costs of tariffs.

Earlier this month, Temu and Shein said in separate but nearly identical notes that their operating expenses had gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs”. They both announced that price hikes would take effect on April 25.

Temu, owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, now lists added “import charges”, which have reportedly doubled many items’ prices, although those available in local warehouses currently appear to be exempt.

Meanwhile, Shein, which is focused on fast fashion and based in Singapore, has a checkout banner that now reads, “Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You’ll never have to pay extra at delivery.”

Though Temu and Shein have experienced rapid growth in recent years – they were the top two most downloaded apps in the US in 2023 – their share of America’s e-commerce market remains much smaller than Amazon’s.

Still, their exposure to tariffs on Chinese imports remains just as significant.

According to a 2023 investigation by the US House Select Committee, nearly half of Temu and Shein’s goods shipments to the United States originated from China – amounting to approximately 600,000 packages per day.​

Like other e-commerce firms, Temu and Shein are attempting to move some production lines to the US, as well as stocking more inventory there. But these measures won’t be enough to prevent Americans from swallowing higher prices.

Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that Trump’s unpredictable tariff policy and countermeasures by America’s trading partners will likely deal aheavy blowto US prosperity.

At the start of the year, the IMF expected the American economy to grow at 2.7 percent in 2025. Following the announcement of Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, the fund lowered its projection to 1.8 percent.

The IMF has also grown gloomier on consumer prices and now sees US inflation hitting 3 percent this year, compared with its January forecast of 2 percent. Much of that rise will be felt in the form of Chinese imports.

On April 16, the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that Trump’s tariffs were generating a “challenging scenario” for the central bank and were likely to generate higher inflation.

Powell added that Trump’s tariffs were likely to cause “at least a temporary rise in inflation”. He also suggested that “the inflationary effects could also be more persistent”.

tariffs,Imposing tariffs on China will not help resolve the US fentanyl crisis,"On February 1, the United States government announced a new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports under the pretext of combatting the proliferation of the opioid fentanyl. The following day, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that China firmly deplored and opposed this move and would take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.

Indeed, a new tariff is counterproductive not only when it comes to efforts to rein in the production and distribution of fentanyl but also for bilateral trade relations.









The US is one of the largest consumers of fentanyl-based drugs in the world and in recent years, their abuse has exacerbated drug addiction and caused many deaths. The crisis has its roots in longstanding opioid use patterns in the country, the profit-driven nature of the US pharmaceutical industry, inadequate public awareness and ineffective social governance.

China has some of the world’s toughest counternarcotics policies and laws. In the spirit of humanity and goodwill, China has given support to the US’s response to this issue. At the US’s request, China announced back in 2019 the decision to officially schedule fentanyl-related substances as a class. China has conducted counternarcotics cooperation with the US side in such fields as the scheduling of drug-related substances, intelligence sharing, and cooperation on individual cases.

Yet, the US still insists on dramatising the issue and accuses China of driving its fentanyl crisis. But scapegoating other countries for a domestic crisis will not make the problem disappear; tariffs certainly will not.

The unilateral sanctions imposed by the US risk weakening its anti-drug cooperation with China and may also force fentanyl precursor transactions to be conducted on the black market or through third countries, making law enforcement even more difficult.

Furthermore, these unilateral sanctions imposed violate the basic principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which both China and the US are members. According to the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) – the precursor to the WHO – trade shall be conducted in a non-discriminatory manner.

However, the unilateral sanctions imposed by the US on specific countries or enterprises essentially constitute discriminatory treatment. This undermines fair competition among WTO members and poses a potential threat to multilateral trade rules.

Additionally, the US practices violate the principle of national treatment laid out in Article III of GATT. The article requires that imported products must not be accorded unfavourable treatment based on their origin after entering the territory of a WTO member. The sanctions the US imposed may directly restrict the import of legal drugs or their precursor chemicals, resulting in discrimination against imported goods from China.

The US may seek to justify its unilateral tariffs by citing threats to public health or national security, which under GATT can be used to justify tariffs. But to invoke GATT’s Article XX (“General Exceptions”) or Article XXI (“Security Exceptions”), the US would have to demonstrate not only the relevance and necessity of imposing tariffs to protect public health or national security, but also the absence of other less trade-distorting and equally effective means. Factors such as the complexity of the fentanyl crisis and domestic demand make it difficult for the exceptions to be applied.

The frequent use of unilateral sanctions by the US not only violates the core rules of the WTO but also disrupts the international trade order and multilateral cooperation. In particular, abusing exception clauses may prompt other countries to question the fairness and efficacy of WTO rules. The possible retaliation in response to US tariffs from other WTO members could lead to a global trade conflict and encourage the trend towards fragmentation of the global trading system.

In the long run, the US sanctions will backfire at home as well. Higher tariffs will result in increased prices for imported goods, increasing the burden on American consumers and undercutting the competitiveness of US companies globally.

The US needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way instead of threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes. Reducing domestic demand for drugs and enhancing law enforcement cooperation can be effective solutions to the fentanyl crisis.

Trade and tariff wars have no winners. Pressuring or threatening China is not the right way to engage, as my country will firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests.

Keeping business ties between China and the US robust serves the fundamental interests of both countries and both peoples, and benefits global economic growth. China hopes the US will work with it to address concerns through equal-footed consultation, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in counternarcotics cooperation, and jointly promote the steady, sound and sustainable growth of bilateral trade and economic ties.

tariffs,"Trump imposes 50% tariff on Africa’s Lesotho, the highest among nations","The Trump administration has imposed a steep 50 percent tariff on Lesotho, a small, impoverished African nation of two million people – the highest tariff levied on any country.

The measure delivers a severe blow to Lesotho’s economy, which relies heavily on exports for its modest $2bn gross domestic product (GDP).

United States President Donald Trump, who mocked Lesotho last month as a country “nobody has ever heard of”, announced it as part of a sweeping set of“reciprocal tariffs”laid out on Thursday.

Trump’s new tariffswere calculated based on the US trade deficit with each country, divided by the total value of imports from that nation. As a result, smaller economies with limited imports from the US – such as Lesotho and Madagascar – were hit hardest.

Lesotho’s trade surplus with the US is largely driven by diamond and textile exports, including Levi’s jeans. In 2024, its exports to the US totalled $237m, accounting for more than 10 percent of its GDP, according to Oxford Economics.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration claims Lesotho imposes a 99 percent tariff on US goods.

The high levies on Lesotho and other African states signalled the end of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal that was supposed to help African economies develop through preferential access to US markets, trade experts said.

It also compounded the pain after Trump’s administration dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which was a major aid provider to the continent.

Thabo Qhesi, a Maseru-based independent economic analyst, said the US tariff on Lesotho “is going to kill the [country’s] textile and apparel sector”, its largest private employer.

“If the closure of factories were to happen, the industry is going to die and there will be multiplier effects,” Qhesi said. “So Lesotho will be dead, so to say.”

The Lesotho government did not comment immediately on the trade tariffs. But its foreign minister told the Reuters news agency last month the country, which has one of the highest HIV/AIDS infection rates in the world, was feeling the impact of the aid cuts as the health sector had been reliant on them.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/trump-imposes-50-tariff-on-africas-lesotho-the-highest-among-nations
tariffs,Ryanair threatens cancelling Boeing aircraft order amid tariffs: Report,"European budget airline Ryanair threatened to cancel hundreds of orders of Boeing aircraftamid tariffs imposedby the United States, which have driven prices higher and is considering alternative suppliers, including Chinese planemaker COMAC.

The news agency Reuters first reported the story on Thursday.

The airline had ordered 330 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft – at a list price of more than $30bn.

Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary said in a letter to an undisclosed senior US lawmaker “If the US government proceedswith its ill-judged plan to impose tariffs, and if these tariffs materially affect the price of Boeing aircraft exports to Europe, then we would certainly reassess both our current Boeing orders, and the possibility of placing those orders elsewhere,” Reuters reported.

The threat byEurope’s largest low-cost carrier, and one of Boeing’s biggest customers, was the latest sign of a potential reordering of the global aerospace industry if Trump does not exempt the sector from his tariff plans.



The letter, seen by Reuters, was a response to a warning by US Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, about the security implications of Ryanair following through on an earlier suggestion it might consider a COMAC order.

But with COMAC not yet certified in Europe, and Boeing’s main rival Airbus saying it is sold out through the rest of the decade, Ryanair may find it hard to follow through on its threat, one industry source told Reuters.

O’Leary’s letter is an escalation from a previous threat in April, in which he said that the airline would delay deliveries.

In March, he said that Boeing executives had privately expressed confidence that aircraft would be exempted from Trump’s tariffs.

According to Reuters, aircraft industry sources said that Boeing and Airbus contracts do not include any provision for tariffs, since the industry has for decades operated without them. Tariffs only become due once ownership of the aircraft has passed to the purchasing airline and the contract has been completed.

Most aircraft purchase contracts include a clause requiring all sides to pay their own taxes without explicitly mentioning tariffs, the sources said. But many aerospace companies are said to be reviewing the wording of contracts for future deals on the assumption that trade turbulence will remain for some time.

O’Leary’s comments in the letter may in part be a tactical intervention before a period of potentially tough negotiations with Boeing behind the scenes, the industry sources told the outlet.

O’Leary said in the letter that the Irish airline has not had any discussions with COMAC about aircraft purchases since about 2011, but that it would “of course” consider it if they were 10 to 20 percent cheaper than Boeing’s main rival, Airbus.

Airbus, which is Boeing’s only competitor for large single-aisle aircraft that are currently certified in Europe, has repeatedly said it is sold out through the rest of the decade.









No Western airline has bought a COMAC plane. The Chinese company has applied for certification for its C919 jet in Europe, but not in the US.

The C919 jet is approximately 150 seats, or up to about 190 in dense layouts, smaller than the Boeing planes Ryanair currently flies and the MAX 10, which make up most of the planes it has on order, which can seat up to 230.

Ryanair’s threat comes as Boeing is looking to resell potentially dozens of planes locked out of China by tariffs after repatriating a third jet to the US in a delivery standoff that prompted more criticism of Beijing from Trump.

It is rare for airlines to cancel aeroplane contracts, rather than delay delivery, because of the small number of suppliers and the risk of returning to the back of the queue for capacity, dampening growth, analysts say.

And attempts by airlines to cancel contracts are typically resisted by planemakers, who can cite a list of excusable factors like supply chain delays, according to industry sources and previous court filings.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/1/ryanair-threatens-cancelling-boeing-aircraft-order-amid-tariffs-report
tariffs,China’s Xi says tariffs ‘yield no winners’ as he begins Southeast Asia tour,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned that trade wars “yield no winners” as he prepares to kick off a tour of Southeast Asia against the backdrop of heightened trade tensions between China and the United States.

Writing in Vietnam’s Nhan Dan newspaper ahead of his visit to the country on Monday, Xi said that countries should work to advance a “comprehensive and inclusive global economic globalization”.









“Trade wars and tariff wars yield no winners, and protectionism offers no solutions,” Xi said.

“There is a need to resolutely protect the multilateral trading system, sustain the stability of global production and supply chains, and maintain an open and cooperative international environment.”

At a time of rising unilateralism and protectionism, China’s economy has remained a “key driver of the world economy,” Xi said.

“China will persist in high-level openness, creating more opportunities for the world, and contributing to the shared development of countries through its own high-quality development,” the Chinese leader said.

Xi arrives in Vietnam on Monday as part of a five-day tour that will also see him visit Malaysia and Cambodia.

The trip comes as Beijing is seeking to portray itself as a reliable trade partner for the region amid the uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump’s back-and-forth announcements on tariffs.

Trump has slapped a baseline tariff of 10 percent on dozens of countries, many of them in Asia, in addition to targeted tariffs of 25 percent on vehicles, steel and aluminium.

The US president has said he will introduce new tariffs on semiconductors this week, while steep “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of US trade partners are on pause until July following his announcement of a 90-day reprieve last week.

Trump’s pause did not include China, whose exports have been slapped with a 145 percent tariff.

China is the biggest trade partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as the top trade partner of Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia individually.

Vietnam is the biggest buyer of Chinese goods in the region, with imports from China surging more than 30 percent to $144bn in 2024, according to the General Department of Vietnam Customs.

After Vietnam, Xi is scheduled to visit Malaysia from Tuesday to Thursday, followed by a visit to Cambodia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/14/chinas-xi-says-tariffs-yield-no-winners-as-he-begins-southeast-asia-tour
tariffs,‘Cool head’: How Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum got Trump to halt some tariffs,"As United States President Donald Trump’s sweeping 25-percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada were about to kick in on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hit back.

Even before the tariffs actually came into effect, Trudeau put out a statement, calling the tariffs “unjustified” and imposing immediate retaliatory tariffs. Then, a few hours later, on Tuesday morning, he addressed a news conference where he referred to Trump as “Donald”, called the tariffs a “very dumb thing to do”, and accused the US president of trying to cripple the Canadian economy to annex the country.

In contrast, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s first comments only came in a news conference on Tuesday. She promised to defend Mexican interests. But while announcing tit-for-tat tariffs on US imports, she said these would only come into effect on Sunday, giving it time to strike a deal with the US.

That deal came over a phone call with Trump on Thursday, during which, according to Sheinbaum’s account, the US president initially refused to budge on the tariffs. But the Mexican president persisted – and, by the end, Trump had relented.

He announced a waiver until April 2 from the tariffs on all Mexican imports covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) and used warm words for Sheinbaum. “I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum,” he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. “Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border.”

Later, he extended that reprieve to Canada, too – but continued to target Trudeau, whom he has repeatedly mocked andmade unsubstantiated claimsagainst.

So why is Mexico’s president approaching Trump’s tariffs so differently from how Canada and Trudeau are handling them? What did she say to Trump on Thursday? How is Mexico responding to Sheinbaum’s strategy? How did we get here? And what’s at stake?

Even before he was sworn into office for a second time in January, Trump announced he would impose 25-percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, citing concerns over border security and drug trafficking, particularly the flow of fentanyl into the US.

The US is the second-largest goods trader in the world after China, and Trump’s tariffs have rattled global markets.

These tariffs were initially scheduled to take effect on February 4, but negotiations between Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico resulted in the US postponing their imposition for a month.



In those negotiations, Trudeau and Sheinbaum agreed to boost border security to prevent drug trafficking and the entry of migrants into the US.

Trudeau appointed a “fentanyl czar” to tackle that issue. Sheinbaum deployed 10,000 additional soldiers to the US-Mexico border to help curb irregular immigration. Within Mexico, her law enforcement agencies busted fentanyl gangs, raided labs and made arrests. Last week, Mexico sent 29 drug cartel leaders to the US for prosecution.

Still, on Tuesday, Trump enacted the 25-percent tariffs, affecting a wide array of goods, before partly – and temporarily – rolling them back on Thursday. Additional tariffs were also imposed on China.

The US’s top three trading partners – Mexico, Canada and China – account for more than 35 percent of the goods that the world’s largest economy imports or exports.

Canada responded promptly and assertively to the US tariffs with retaliatory protectionist measures of its own that it had first announced on February 1.

Starting on Tuesday, Canada imposed 25-percent tariffs on $21bn worth of US goods with the threat of tariffs on another estimated $87bn if the dispute lasts.

Trudeau warned that Canada “will not back down from a fight” and tariffs would remain in place until the US tariffs are withdrawn.

Products including meats, grains, certain alcohol, clothes, footwear, motorcycles and cosmetics are just some of the US goods that will be subject to immediate tariffs, according to Canada’s Department of Finance.

Some Canadian provinces have taken steps of their own, ordering the removal of all US liquor from stores, for instance.

Trudeau, in comments on Tuesday, also seemed to back Canadians who are choosing to boycott American goods and boo the US national anthem at sporting events.

Trudeau had a call with Trump on Wednesday, but while the US president said it ended on a “somewhat ‘friendly'” note, he subsequently accused Canada of allowing fentanyl to enter the US – even though experts said only a minuscule amount of the opioid comes into the US across its northern border.

Ultimately, relief in the form of tariff exemptions on Canadian imports into the US that are covered by the USMCA only came after Trump’s call with Sheinbaum the following day.

While Trump and Trudeau have exchanged heated personal remarks in recent weeks, Sheinbaum has taken a more measured approach.

In her comments on Tuesday, Sheinbaum expressed the intention to implement “tariff and non-tariff measures” to safeguard Mexico’s interests but refrained from immediate action, suggesting she intends to exhaust all diplomatic channels first.

“What I can tell you is that this is a very definitive moment for Mexico … There is not going to be submission. Mexico is a great country, and Mexicans are brave and resistant,” she said.

If the tariffs continued, Mexico would “reach out to Canada and other nations”, Sheinbaum said. She added that Mexico may look for other trading partners besides the US and could shift trade alliances “if necessary”.

Recounting her conversation with Trump at a news conference later on Thursday, Sheinbaum said Trump initially insisted that the tariffs enforced on Tuesday would stay.

But Sheinbaum sent Trump a chart that demonstrated how seizures of fentanyl by agents along the US-Mexico border had fallen dramatically since she sent her 10,000 soldier-strong force there.

She told him their collaboration was yielding results in strengthening security along the border, and the tariffs would hurt that partnership, Sheinbaum told reporters.

The pitch worked.

On Truth Social, Trump announced that tariffs on Mexican imports covered by the USMCA would be waived until April 2, when he intends to implement reciprocal tariffs on all countries. He spoke of his respect for Sheinbaum. “Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!” he said.

The Mexican president reciprocated the gesture, with a message of her own. “Many thanks to President Donald Trump. We had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results, within the framework of respect for our sovereignties,” she wrote on X.

At a briefing with reporters in early February, Sheinbaum offered insights into her mindset, saying that amid threats from Trump, Mexico needed to keep a “cool head”.

This cautious strategy reflects Mexico’s heavy reliance on the US as a market: More than 75 percent of Mexico’s exports go to its northern neighbour, so any dramatic disruption in that equation could bleed the country’s economy. Last year, the US imported $505.8bn in goods from Mexico and exported $334bn, resulting in a trade deficit of $171.8bn.

To be sure, Canada also needs the US for its exports: More than 70 percent of Canadian exports go to the US.

But the context of Trump’s tariffs on Mexico and Canada is quite different, Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera.

While Trump in the past has mooted the idea of bombing Mexico’s drug cartels, many of which his administration has designated as “terrorist” organisations, he has been much more direct in seeking Canada’s territory.

Trump has frequently said his northern neighbour should become the 51st US state.

And while Trump has said he respects Sheinbaum, he has repeatedly referred to Trudeau, including after their call on Wednesday, as governor rather than prime minister.

“In Canada’s case, Trudeau noted that Trump’s actions are aimed at crippling the Canadian economy to pave the way for an eventual annexation, which goes beyond a mere trade war,” Nadjibulla said, referring to Trump’s repeated threats to absorb Canada.

“It’s an existential fight for Canada’s sovereignty, so there’s a strong incentive to push back immediately and forcefully,” she said.

Commenting on the new tariffs, Trudeau on Tuesday said Trump was planning to cause the “total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us”.

“Retaliation here isn’t just about tit-for-tat tariffs. It’s about defending the country’s independence,” Nadjibulla said.

Sheinbaum also has something that Trudeau does not: Time.

Canada is fast approaching national elections, and Trudeau’s Liberal Party is playing catch-up. After trailing the opposition Conservative Party by double digits for more than a year, the country’s governing party has started torapidly close the gapas Trudeau pushes back against Trump’s moves and the US president’s steps stoke a wave of patriotism among Canadians.

Sheinbaum, on the other hand, took office only in October and is wildly popular. In two polls in February, her approval rating was 80 percent and 85 percent.

It’s too early to say.

But on Wednesday, the Trump administration exempted auto manufacturers from the 25-percent tariffs for a month. While the sector’s supply chains are spread across North America, Mexico is the biggest beneficiary of the reprieve. Cars, trucks, other vehicles and auto parts constitute 27 percent of its exports to the US. For Canada, that figure stands at 13 percent.



Then, on Thursday, she won a reprieve on tariffs for all Mexican exports covered by the USMCA.

And Sheinbaum enjoys more than just popular support in Mexico. Her approach to Trump and his tariffs appears to have the trust of Mexican investors, too.

The IPC, the main index of the country’s stock exchange, is up 6 percent from the start of the year. By contrast, the S&P/TSX, the benchmark Canadian stock exchange index, is almost where it was at the start of the year.

Even with the temporary reprieve on Thursday, many goods exported by Mexico and Canada to the US – including Canadian oil, for instance – are not covered by the USMCA and so are subject to Trump’s tariffs. Canadian oil faces a 10 percent tariff. And on April 2, Trump plans to introduce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world.

With such tariffs, and the retaliatory steps taken by other countries, businesses exporting goods and services as well as consumers will pay higher prices. A potential recession in some or all three North American countries is a possibility.







But even if Trump decides to de-escalate, Nadjibulla said, “the damage to trust is already substantial.”

“We’ve seen him threaten new tariffs in April and continue to shift targets. That level of unpredictability erodes confidence among allies and trading partners,” she said.

The tariffs could also affect negotiations on renewing the USMCA, a free-trade pact that came into effect in 2020, was negotiated by Trump’s team during his first term and replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994. A review of the USMCA is due in 2026, but the tariffs could see talks take place sooner.

“How do you negotiate a stable agreement when one party is consistently changing the rules or imposing new tariffs without warning?” Nadjibulla asked.

“Even if some tariffs get lifted or eased, the bigger issue is that Canada and others now view the US as a less reliable trade partner,” she added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/6/cool-head-how-mexicos-claudia-sheinbaum-is-handling-trump-and-tariffs
tariffs,"Trump’s auto tariffs could help China’s carmakers, experts say","China’s automakers could be among the surprising beneficiaries of United States President Donald Trump’s trade war as a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts takes effect on Thursday, analysts say.

The White House has argued the tariff is necessary to protect the US auto industry and strengthen the country’s industrial base and supply chains.

The US last year imported $475bn worth of auto parts, engines and vehicles, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, primarily from Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Germany and Canada.

China’s presence in the US auto industry has been limited since Trump launched his first trade war in 2018 and imposed tariffs on $380bn worth of Chinese goods.

Chinese-made “light vehicles” – cars, vans, and motorcycles – represented only 0.4 percent of light vehicle sales in the US in 2024, according to JATO Dynamics, an automotive market research firm.

This limited presence is largely due to low brand recognition in the US for Chinese automakers and a 100 percent tariff imposed last year by former US President Joe Biden.

Starting in 2027, the US will also ban the sale of any Chinese-made “connected vehicle” hardware or software on alleged national security grounds.

These systems, commonly found in EVs, allow vehicles to exchange data via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or satellite.

Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Chinese automakers are less immediately affected by the US tariffs than their global competitors, which could give them a long-term advantage.

“With European, Japanese and South Korean brands financially burdened by the US market, Chinese brands now have weakened competitors. The cost of doing business in the US will hurt every automaker in that market, but Chinese automakers don’t rely on the US for significant revenue,” Fiorani told Al Jazeera.

Chinese automakers could also benefit as their competitors face higher costs due to the tariffs, potentially making them more cost competitive in other markets, Fiorani said.







The benefits will be most apparent in the EV market, according to experts, even as they remain locked out of the US.

China dominates both EV manufacturing and battery production, and last year its EV powerhouse BYD surpassed Elon Musk’s Tesla in annual global revenue thanks to strong domestic sales.

China is also home to six of the world’s top 10 EV battery manufacturers.

While Trump’s tariffs are expected to have a limited impact on Tesla, which relies less on foreign parts, experts say they will harm would-be competitors to BYD like South Korea’s Hyundai, Japan’s Nissan, and Germany’s BMW and Mercedes.

Tu Le, the founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights, said Trump’s tariff policies and push to onshore manufacturing in the US could make American brands less competitive in the long term, ultimately benefitting China.

“The reality is, if things continue as they are for the US auto industry, it could be uncompetitive in four years. Instead of investing in clean energy or charging infrastructure, they are focusing on bringing factories back to the United States,” Lu told Al Jazeera.

However, Chinese auto parts suppliers could suffer greater fallout from the tariffs than automakers due to their higher exposure to the US market, according to Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

“Chinese carmakers don’t sell much in the US, especially due to high tariffs on electric vehicles, which Chinese brands tend to dominate. However, Chinese auto part manufacturers have historically seen the US as a major market,” Marro told Al Jazeera.

“If disruptions occur, it would likely affect the intermediate components part of the supply chain, which could have cascading effects on the final assembly of US vehicles.”







A significant question surrounding Trump’s auto tariffs is how they will affect Chinese and other foreign manufacturers that have relocated to Mexico to take advantage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and proximity to the US border.

Following Trump’s 2018 trade war with Beijing, many Chinese manufacturers moved operations to Southeast Asia and later Mexico to avoid tariffs.

As a result, Mexico’s trade with the US has surged, surpassing China to become the US’s top trading partner in 2023.

In 2024, Mexico supplied more than 40 percent of US auto parts, but many originated from Chinese factories that established operations there over the past eight years.

While the Mexican and Canadian auto industries will receive some exemptions from Trump’s 25 percent tariffs thanks to the USMCA, the EIU’s Marro said that Mexico City is expected to reassess its Chinese manufacturing base as it tries to negotiate down additional tariffs.

During his presidential campaign last year, Trump incorrectly claimed that Mexico allowed Chinese automakers to build factories to ship finished vehicles to the US without paying taxes.

The issue remains a point of contention, particularly after Trump’s return to the White House in January.

The Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter, reported last month that Mexico’s Ministry of Commerce had been delaying approving a BYD manufacturing facility due to concerns smart car technology could make it across the US border.

Tu Le from Sino Auto Insights said some Chinese companies might seek permission to set up manufacturing in the US.

“I think there is going to be a huge opportunity for Chinese automakers to negotiate a way to build in the United States. I think the Trump administration might see that there is investment happening in the EU,” he said.

Such a development would follow similar moves by other Asian carmakers, such as South Korea’s Hyundai, which recently announced a $21bn investment in the US ahead of the tariff deadline.

Ilaria Marzocco, a senior fellow specialising in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said prospects for Chinese automakers remain uncertain due to current restrictions on “connected vehicles” imposed by the Bureau of Industry and Security in January.

“I think many people are speculating about a deal where Chinese automakers invest in the US. But aside from the politics, which are challenging, the current connected vehicle restrictions would make it very difficult,” Marzocco told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/trumps-auto-tariffs-could-help-chinas-carmakers-experts-say
tariffs,"Trump pauses some Mexico, Canada tariffs: What’s exempt, and what’s next?","United States President Donald Trump, on Thursday,paused tariffson several imports from Mexico and Canada for a month. Earlier, he had imposed 25 percent tariffs on almost all imports from both countries.

He first announced a halt on the tariffs for Mexico after a phone call with that country’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Later, he extended that reprieve to Canada.

Here is what happened, which products the pause applies to and what comes next:

On Thursday, Trump signed orders temporarily exempting goods from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) from the 25 percent tariffs. The order suspending tariffs took effect at 05:01 GMT on Friday.

These tariffs had kicked in on Tuesday, a month after Trump had firstannounced 25 percent tariffson all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10 percent tariffs on imports from China, in February. The tariffs were initially supposed to come into force on February 4, but Trump had postponed them by a month following negotiations with Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

On Wednesday, Trump had temporarilyexempted car manufacturersfrom the 25 percent tariffs for a month.

The tariff pause announced on Thursday will remain until April 2, Trump announced. That’s when Trump has threatened to impose a global regime of reciprocal tariffs on all US trading partners: Each country will face the same tariff rates that it subjects US goods to.

But even before that, Trump is still set to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminium imports on March 12. Canada and Mexico are big exporters of these products to the US – particularly Canada, which supplies the US with most of its aluminium.

In his Truth Social post, Trump wrote: “After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement. This Agreement is until April 2nd.”

Trump added that he did this “out of respect” forSheinbaum, adding the US and Mexico have had a good relationship and the two countries are working together to regulate undocumented migration and the flow of fentanyl into the US.

He later said Canadian exports to the US covered by the USMCA would also be similarly exempt.

USMCAis short for United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free-trade agreement negotiated during Trump’s first term.

It was signed in 2018 and came into force on July 1, 2020, replacing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

The USMCA is supposed to be reviewed every six years.

While details of specific products that will be exempt are unclear, the overall benefit to Mexican exports is significant.

In 2024,Mexico’s total exportsto the US were worth about $505.8bn. According to US Census Bureau data, the exports that fell under the USMCA were about $249.7bn.

This means Trump’s reprieve will apply to about 49 percent of Mexico’s exports to the US.

In 2024, Canada’s exports to the US were worth about $412.7bn. Out of these, about $156.9bn were under the USMCA.

Hence, Trump’s pause applies to 38 percent of Canada’s exports to the US.

Almost all agricultural products traded between the US and Canada fall under the USMCA. Additionally for Canada, Trump’s reprieve also applies to potash, a fertiliser.

The pause does not fully cover energy products, on which Trump has imposed a separate 10 percent tariff. Canada is the biggest source of US oil imports.

Mexican President Sheinbaum posted on X on Thursday, “We had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results, within the framework of respect for our sovereignties.”

While Mexico had initially planned to announce retaliatory tariffs on Sunday at a public event in Zocalo, the heart of capital Mexico City, that gathering is now poised to be more of a celebration of the reprieve.

When Trump first announced the tariffs, Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs worth $30 billion Canadian dollars ($21bn) on US products including orange juice, peanut butter, cosmetics, footwear and paper products. Two Canadian officials told The Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity that these tariffs will remain in place.

Canada has delayed its second wave of retaliatory tariffs on $125 billion Canadian dollars’ ($87.3bn) worth of US imports until April 2, Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc wrote in an X post.

Doug Ford, the premier of Canada’s Ontario, also said the 25 percent tariffs on Ontario’s electricity, which is supplied to 1.5 million Americans in Minnesota, New York and Michigan will remain. “A pause on some tariffs means nothing. Until President Trump removes the threat of tariffs for good, we will be relentless,” Ford wrote in an X post.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is stepping down from his position after elections for his Liberal Party’s leadership on Sunday, told reporters he saw a trade war between the US and Canada in the foreseeable future after he had a call with Trump on Wednesday. “It was a colourful call. It was also a very substantive call,” Trudeau said.

Shortly after, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during an event in New York: “If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say ‘Oh, we’re going to do this,’ then tariffs are going to go up.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/7/trump-pauses-some-mexico-canada-tariffs-whats-exempt-and-whats-next

tariffs,"Trump tariffs of 25% on Canada, Mexico set to kick in March 4","United States President Donald Trump has said that his proposed 25-percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods will go into effect on March 4 and threatened an extra 10-percent duty on Chinese imports because, he claims, deadly drugs are still pouring into the US from those countries.

Trumpsaid in a poston his Truth Social site on Thursday that he would impose the additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods on March 4. This would come on top of the 10 percent tariff that he levied on February 4 on imports from China over the fentanyl opioid crisis.

Trump said drugs, namely fentanyl, were still coming into the US at “very high and unacceptable levels,” with a large percentage of them the deadly opioid fentanyl.

“We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,” Trump added. “China will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date.”

Those comments Thursday cleared up some of theconfusion Trump sowedduring his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday when he seemed to suggest that he may push the deadline back for about one month until April 4.

But subsequent comments from Trump administration officials indicated that the April deadline was for Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” matching import duty rates of other countries and offsetting their other restrictions. His trade advisers consider European countries’ value-added taxes to be akin to a tariff.

Kevin Hassett, the top White House economic adviser, told CNBC television on Thursday that Trump would determine new tariffs after a study is completed by April 1.

Trump decided to add the extra tariffs on China and stick to the Tuesday deadline for Canada and Mexico given what his administration sees as insufficient progress in reducing fentanyl deaths, a White House official told Reuters.

“There are ongoing discussions with the Chinese, Mexico and Canada. We’ve gotten a good handle on the migration issue, but there are still concerns on the other issue of fentanyl deaths,” the official said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, 72,776 people died from synthetic opioids in 2023 in the US, chiefly from fentanyl.







Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican officials were due to meet Trump administration counterparts in Washington, DC on Thursday and Friday to try to forestall the tariffs, which could deal a serious blow to a highly integrated North American economy.

Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard will meet newly confirmed US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Thursday and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday.

In Canada, Public Safety Minister David McGuinty said on Thursday that the progress Canada has made on tightening security along the border with the United States and combating drug smuggling should satisfy the Trump administration.

“The evidence is irrefutable – progress is being made,” McGuinty said in televised remarks to reporters in Washington before two days of talks with US officials, adding that any test on those metrics had been “met”.

The Canada Border Services Agency said in a statement that it was launching a targeted, cross-country initiative to intercept illegal contraband arriving and leaving the country, with a focus on fentanyl and other synthetic narcotics.

China, in a letter to Greer, said the two countries should address concerns in economic and trade fields through equal dialogue and consultation.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/27/trump-tariffs-of-25-on-canada-mexico-set-to-kick-in-march-4
tariffs,"Penguins, vaccines: Can negotiations save Trump’s oddest tariff targets?","President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on more than 180 trading partners of the United States last week.

He described these as “reciprocal tariffs” against countries that impose heavy duties on US imports, aimed at rebalancing a global trade equation that he has long argued is weighted against his country.

The president has cited imbalanced US trade to justify his argument. Indeed, the US has thelargest trade deficitin the world and, in 2023, its import costs were $1.1 trillion more than its exports.

However, some of his tariff targets are sparsely populated islands that barely trade with the US and pose little economic challenge to the world’s largest economy.

Still, others are countries that the US has a trade surplus with — raising questions about the Trump administration’s formula for calculating the tariffs, even as it says dozens of countries are lining up to negotiate with Washington on lowering the duties slapped on their goods.

So what is the tariff formula used by the Trump team? Which are some of the hardest-to-explain targets? And can negotiations help these and other countries and territories?





When Trump announced the tariffs, he held up a chart listing the “reciprocal tariff” percentages for each country and territory next to the tariffs that he claimed these nations and territories were imposing on US imports.

In fact, he claimed that he was being gentle and imposing tariffs that were half, in many cases, of the tariffs that he said the target countries were imposing on US goods.

But, in reality, the formula used by the Trump administration to calculate what it says are reciprocal tariffs has nothing to do with the tariffs imposed by other countries on the US at all.

Instead, to determine its tariff rate for a country, the administration has divided the trade deficit by two times the value of total imports from that country and multiplied the resulting number by 100 to obtain a percentage value.

A trade deficit occurs when a country’s imports are worth more than its exports, while a surplus refers to when exports are of higher value than imports.

For example, the US trade deficit with China in 2024 was $295bn and the total imports from China were $439bn. Dividing the deficit by the imports yields 0.67, and this number halved is 0.34. Trump has imposed a reciprocal tariff of 34 percent on China. The equation does not actually factor in the tariff percentage that China has imposed on US products.

And the Trump administration has not followed even this formula uniformly — if it did, there should be no tariffs imposed on countries and territories with which the US has a trade surplus.

Here are some of Trump’s most bizarre tariff targets:

Trump hit the Australian territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands, about 1,700km (1,056 miles) from Antarctica and 4,000km (2,485 miles) from Perth city, with a 10 percent tariff.

These islands are not inhabited by people, but instead by seals, penguins, and other flying bird species.

World Bank data shows that in 2022, the US imported products worth $1.4m from the islands. Most of these products are unnamed “electronics and machinery”. In 2024, the US did not trade at all with the territory, according to US Census data.

Australian leaders, including Trade Minister Don Farrell, speculated that Trump tariffed the islands by mistake. “Poor old penguins, I don’t know what they did to Trump, but, look, I think it’s an indication, to be honest with you, that this was a rushed process,” Farrell told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on April 4.

But Trump’s aides insist that this was not a mistake.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News on Sunday that the islands were tariffed so that Trump’s other tariff targets do not try to bypass their tariffs by exporting their products to the US through remote islands like Heard and McDonald. “If you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us,” said Lutnick.

Trump also slapped a 29 percent tariff on another Australian territory, Norfolk Island.

The territory is in the South Pacific Ocean, about 1,600km (990 miles) northeast of Sydney, with a population of about 2,000. World Bank data shows that the US imported goods worth $273,000 in 2022 from the territory. Most of these goods were labelled as “chemicals”.

In 2024, the US had a trade deficit of $100,000 with Norfolk Island.

“I’m not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is safe from this,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, speaking of the tariffs imposed on the territory.

Cocos or Keeling Islands is another Australian territory in the Indian Ocean with a 10 percent tariff.

The island with 544 people had a trade surplus of $1.5m with the US in 2024.

Yet another Australian territory in the Indian Ocean – home to 1,692 people – Christmas Island also faces a 10 percent US tariff.

In 2024, the territory had a trade surplus of $400,000 with the US. A quarter of the island’s exports go to the US, where it sends paintings, amine compounds  — chemicals used for making nylon and dyes — and broadcasting equipment, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.

This territory of New Zealand in the Southern Pacific Ocean has been hit with a 10 percent tariff by the US.

In 2024, Tokelau had a $100,000 trade surplus with the US, exporting $200,000 worth of products. The total population of these atolls is 2,600, according to World Population Review.

Trump has charged Reunion, a small French overseas department in the Indian Ocean, with a 37 percent tariff, according to a chart shared on X by the White House on April 2. The island is about 9,000km (5,600 miles) from France.

Its total population is 882,000, according to the latest World Population Review data. The US had a $32.2m trade deficit with Reunion in 2024.



Trump has hit the overseas British territory with 10 percent tariffs — even though its only real trading hub is a military base that the US counts as among its most strategic footholds in the Indian Ocean.

The territory, a group of several islands, does not have a permanent population. However, there is a joint military base of the US and the United Kingdom on its largest island, Diego Garcia. Some 4,000 people, mostly military personnel, inhabit this base.

The US had a $5m trade deficit with the territory in 2024, which exported products worth $500,000 to the country last year.

Like many of these small islands, large countries that the US has a trade surplus with too have been hit with tariffs — defying the formula used to justify levies.

The US has imposed a 10 percent tariff on Australia, saying Canberra charges it 10 percent tariffs.

Australia is a strange target because the US does not have a trade deficit with the country, a variable that falls at the centre of the tariff calculation. In 2024, it enjoyed a trade surplus of $17.9bn with Australia, according to US Census data.

In 2023, 3.57 percent of Australian exports went to the US. Responding to the tariffs on Australia, Albanese said: “The administration’s tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership.”

Trump has hit the UK with a 10 percent tariff as a reciprocal move.

The US also does not have a trade deficit with the UK; instead, it had a trade surplus of nearly $12bn.

In 2023, nearly 24 percent of the UK’s exports went to the US.

Trump has hit the Netherlands, alongside other countries in the European Union, with a 20 percent tariff. However, the US does not have a trade deficit with the country. In fact, in 2024, it had a surplus of nearly $56bn.

Vaccines are the Netherlands’ top export to the US.

As a part of the EU, Belgium faces a 20 percent US tariff.

In 2024, the US had approximately $6.3bn of trade surplus with Belgium.

Brazil faces a 10 percent tariff from the US despite its trade deficit of $7.4bn in 2024.

The US is the second-largest market for Brazilian exports after accounting for 10.4 percent of its exports.

On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC’s Meet the Press thatmore than 50 countrieshad reached out to the US to negotiate the tariffs. “This figure should be interpreted more as a sign of confusion than clarity,” Carlos Lopes, a Chatham House associate fellow for the Africa Programme, told Al Jazeera.

It is unclear what those talks will be about since the tariffs imposed by Trump are not reciprocal — contrary to the US claims — and are based, in many cases, instead on its trade deficit with those nations. And even countries with which the US has a trade surplus have not been left unscathed.

“Many of these contacts are likely exploratory, driven by uncertainty rather than a well-defined negotiation agenda. The ambiguity of the ‘reciprocal tariff’ concept — especially as applied unilaterally — raises more questions than it answers,” said Lopes, whose areas of expertise include international trade and China.

In many ways, say experts, all of this underscores what the tariffs are really about — and what they are not about.

The goal of Trump’s tariff announcement was not to display mathematical precision, but to display power, Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Research Programme and a China studies fellow at the Indian public policy centre Takshashila Institution, told Al Jazeera.

The tariffs are aimed at bringing countries to the negotiating table to discuss broader US economic concerns, he suggested. “Now whether that’s actually what’s going to happen as an outcome remains to be seen.”

It is also unclear whether the US is open to negotiations. While Trump’s close aide billionaire Elon Musk has expressed hopes for“a zero-tariff situation”between the US and Europe, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said the tariffs arehere to stay.

“Trade policy, particularly in goods, is part of a long-term framework shaped by decades of negotiated multilateral and bilateral commitments. Attempting to reframe it as a series of ad hoc deals, driven by perceived imbalances in goods trade alone, risks replacing a positive-sum system with a zero-sum logic,” said Lopes.

Ultimately, Kewalramani said, Trump’s stated goal is to reindustrialise the US and create jobs. “I don’t think the tariff policy is aimed at achieving one goal, but instead was a silver bullet thought in Trump’s head,” he said.

“Maybe to some extent, it will stimulate industry, but it won’t bring back the jobs that went away 35 years ago,” Kewalramani said.

What it will do, he said, is reduce overall trade. “If Trump wants to see that as a reduction of deficit, fair enough.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/8/penguins-vaccines-can-negotiations-save-trumps-oddest-tariff-targets
tariffs,Trump administration considers China tariff cuts: Report,"The administration of United States President Donald Trump is mulling lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods amid talks with Beijing, the Reuters news agency has reported, citing an unnamed source.

No action would be made unilaterally, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

The source’s comments followed a report from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) newspaper that the White House is considering cutting its tariffs on Chinese imports in a bid to de-escalate tensions. China tariffs could come down from their current level of 145 percent to between 50 percent and 65 percent, the paper said, citing a White House official.

“We are going to have a fair deal with China,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday, but did not address the specifics of the WSJ report. His remarks followed optimistic comments he made on Tuesday that a deal to lower tariffs was possible.









US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also declined to comment on the WSJ story, but said that he would not be surprised if tariffs went down. Bessent saidboth countries see the current rates as unsustainable, but said he does not know when any negotiations might start. Bessent added that there needs to be a de-escalation before trade talks can proceed.

“I think both sides are waiting to speak to the other,” Bessent said.

Separate talks between the two countries over tackling the fentanyl epidemic have not yielded results so far, sources say.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai said any reports on tariffs were “pure speculation” unless they came directly from Trump.

The tariff levels outlined in the Wall Street Journal report would likely still be high enough to deter a significant chunk of trade between the world’s two largest economies. German shipper Hapag-Lloyd said Wednesday that 30 percent of its US-bound shipments from China have been cancelled.

China has retaliated with 125 percent tariffson US imports, along with other measures.

US stocks extended their early session gains after the report. The market had opened sharply higher on relief among investors after Trump backed away from threats to fire the head of the US Federal Reserve and said a deal with China was possible. The benchmark S&P 500 index was up roughly 3 percent in mid-morning trading.









The WSJ reported that discussions remain fluid and several options are on the table. One option would be a tiered approach similar to one proposed by the House of Representatives Committee on China late last year: 35 percent levies for items the US deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100 percent for items deemed as strategic to US interests. That bill proposed phasing in those levies over five years.

In addition to the steep tariffs on China, Trump has also imposed a blanket 10 percent tariff on all other US imports and higher duties on steel, aluminium and autos. He has suspended targeted tariffs on dozens of other countries until July 9 and floated additional industry-specific levies on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. That has roiled financial markets and raised fears of global recession.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF)said on Wednesdaythat the tariffs will slow growth and push debt higher across the globe. The IMF – which recently released a Global Financial Stability Report – said that US economic growth would be 1.8 percent for the year, a sharp downturn from the 2.7 percent it previously forecasted.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/4/23/trump-administration-considers-china-tariff-cuts-report
tariffs,"Donald Trump’s trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China explained visually","The United States haspostponedplanned 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports by a month, following 11th-hour calls between President Donald Trump and leaders from Canada and Mexico on Monday.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to boost border security to prevent the trafficking of drugs and migrants into the US, averting a trade war for now.









But the 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods took effect on Tuesday, attracting retaliatory measures from Beijing. Chinese goods have already been subjected to previous tariffs starting in Trump’s first term between 2017 and 2021.

The tariff war by the US, the second-largest goods trader in the world after China, has rattled markets worldwide. From January to November 2024, the value ofgoodstraded between the US and the world reached $4.88 trillion, with $2.98 trillion in exports and $1.90 trillion in imports.

The United States’s top trading partners – Mexico, Canada and China – account for more than 40 percent of total goods traded, valued at more than $2 trillion.



A tariff is a government-imposed tax on imported goods and services, paid by businesses bringing them into the country. Designed to protect domestic industries, tariffs often drive up costs for consumers by making foreign products more expensive, potentially reducing demand.

For example:

Following talks with Trump, Mexican President Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau both made commitments to bolster security at their shared borders with the US.

“I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.

Following his call with Trump, Trudeau announced that Canada would move forward with its previously outlined $1.3bn border plan, while also committing to appointing a “fentanyl czar” and officially designating cartels as “terrorist” organisations.

“Fundamentally it’s very good news that tariffs have been paused and Canada needs to do everything possible to engage with Trump – work on border security issues etc,” Vina Nadjibulla, vice president, research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera.

“But beyond the immediate crisis, we need to work on structural issues that led to this over-dependence on the US. We need to build capacity to export [to places other than the] US and invest in our own competitiveness,” Nadjibulla added.

No, tariffs have been used by several countries before. Historically, in the US from 1790 to 1860, tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue.

Tariffs can also be used to “punish” a foreign producer of goods for not abiding by international trade practices. In 2018, the US began placing tariffs on Chinese goods worth hundreds of billions citing unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. This marked the start of the US-China trade war, where items such as semiconductors, batteries and electronics such as washing machines were taxed.

In the same year, Trump also introduced a 25 percent levy on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminium, affecting a number of countries including Canada, Mexico, India, Brazil and Argentina.







Tariffs are often used to protect certain domestic industries from foreign competitors. This happens by increasing the price of those imported goods. The notion behind tariffs is that buyers will choose domestic products over expensive foreign imports, which in turn will help the domestic industry grow. However, this isn’t always the case.

For example, for the US to produce avocados – 90 percent of which are imported from Mexico – would be a long and arduous feat given that avocados are produced in just three states: California, Florida and Hawaii.

During Trump’s presidential campaign, he promised to impose tariffs on the US’s biggest trading partners in retaliation over undocumented migrants and the flow of drugs, especially fentanyl.

Trump also emphasised using tariffs as a means to bolster domestic manufacturing and encourage foreign businesses to establish factories within the US territory.

Tariffs are also used to generate revenue for a country with the extra income from the taxes levied on imported goods being used for public spending. For example, in 2019, $79bn of revenue was generated in tariffs, double the value from 2017, according to the Brookings Institution. However, the majority of this burden was passed on to consumers who paid higher prices.

“During 2018-2020, President Trump mainly used tariffs as a bargaining chip,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. “This time, the motivations seem broader, including a desire to bring more manufacturing back to the US, shift the tax burden away from income taxes and onto tariffs, and use tariffs both as leverage and as punishment. We’re looking at a much larger scale than we saw under Trump’s first term.”

A range of goods will be heavily affected by Trump’s imposed tariffs. Based on what the US imports the most from Canada, Mexico and China, this will include items such as cars, fuel, computers and electrical equipment. Food items like avocados are also likely to see a price increase.

Trump signed three executive orders placing 25 percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10 percent tariff on Canadian oil and an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods.

Canadais a large exporter of crude oil with 97 percent of its crude oil exports going to the US in 2023, while Mexico exports a large amount of produce such as fruit and vegetable as well as automobile parts.

China is a major exporter of electrical equipment and electronics including chips, laptops and smartphones.

Canada, Mexico and China have all stated that they would react with retaliatory tariffs. Trudeau had said on Saturday that a 25 percent levy would be slapped on a slew of US imports, which have subsequently been paused.

Beijing criticised the latest tariff, saying it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization (WTO), an intergovernmental body responsible for regulating international trade. China has placedcounter-tariffson US imports that will come into effect on February 10.

Under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, US trade representatives wield power to counteract unfair trade practices by foreign countries. This has been at the heart of Washington’s trade war with China since 2018 when tariffs were placed on the world’s largest exporter.

In a significant move, the Biden administration expanded these tariffs in September 2024 to target items such as electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors and solar panels, with levies ranging between 25-100 percent.



“It appears there’s a temporary pause on tariffs against Mexico and Canada. However, tariffs on China are likely to take effect on February 4, and President Trump has signalled additional tariffs against the EU and others. So yes, we could be heading into a trade war,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera.

“In response, countries will likely adopt a range of strategies – from direct retaliation to hedging their trade relationships among the US, China, and other partners. Globally, we can expect inflationary effects and significant disruptions to supply chains.”

“Yes. Both the tariffs themselves and any mitigation measures – such as subsidies or support programmes for affected sectors – will contribute to inflation,” Nadjibulla said. “Higher prices associated with tariffs, combined with the cost of remedy efforts, will lead to inflationary pressures overall.”

“Where possible, buying local products and avoiding certain imports may help consumers manage rising costs,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera.

But they cannot completely escape the inflationary pressure triggered by the tariff war.

Yes, in most cases the cost of items will go up. This is not just final product goods, but capital goods too, which would increase production costs and result in higher costs for final products. Additionally, higher costs for raw materials and parts would raise prices through the supply chain.

According to an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), a US-based nonprofit organisation researching the global economy, machinery and electronics will face the largest import tax – given they are mostly sourced from China and because they currently face low tariff rates.

Other US imports from China likely to be hit the hardest would also include toys and sporting equipment.

Ultimately the consumer. US-based businesses will face paying higher taxes. In most cases, the cost of tariffs is indirectly picked up by consumers as importing businesses are likely to increase the price of said goods to manage the taxes levied.

“Consumers will shoulder much of the burden through higher prices, but businesses will also feel the impact. Industries such as the Canadian and US auto sectors may be especially hard-hit,” Nadjibulla from the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada said.

In theory, the imposition of tariffs would encourage more domestic production, which, in turn, would require more employment. Similarly, if foreign companies are being encouraged to bring their factories to the United States, it would increase employment.

For example, after Trump imposed 20-50 percent tariffs on washing machines, more jobs were brought to two regions where appliances were not previously manufactured: Clarksville, Tennessee and Newberry, South Carolina.

In 2018, LG completed an investment in a new smart factory in Clarksville, to be staffed with 700 employees. Similarly, in 2018, Samsung built an appliance manufacturing facility in Newberry, South Carolina, hiring 1,000 employees.

The US administration would hope the latest tariff war will incentivise corporations to set up more factories and businesses in the US.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/4/donald-trumps-trade-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china-explained-visually
tariffs,‘A historic moment’: Donald Trump unveils sweeping ‘reciprocal’ tariffs,"United States President Donald Trump has unveiled his long-anticipated “reciprocal tariffs“, in a move that is expected to rattle global trade relations.

On Wednesday, Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden, where the colonnades had been draped with large US flags, to sign the executive orders authorising the tariffs.

He framed the tax hikes as a blow against unfair trade practices, painting a portrait of the US as a country exploited by even its closest allies.

“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” Trump told an audience of manufacturing workers, cabinet members and journalists.

“ Foreign leaders have stolen our jobs. Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories. And foreign scavengers have torn apart our once-beautiful American dream.”

But he proclaimed that Wednesday would mark a turning point in US history, marking an end to the “vicious attacks” he said the country had weathered.

“ April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed,” Trump said.

Invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, Trump announced a 10-percent tariff on all countries, scheduled to take effect on April 5.

Then, he revealed there would be “individualised” tariffs for countries that have the largest trade deficits with the US. Those tariffs would come into effect four days later, on April 9.

Trump explained that his team calculated the “individualised” tariffs by taking half of what he claimed those countries had charged the US for its exports.

“ We will charge them approximately half of what they are — and have — been charging us. So the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal,” Trump said. “I could have done that, I guess, but it would’ve been tough for a lot of countries. We didn’t want to do that.”

He then beckoned Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to the Rose Garden podium with a chart that illustrated some of the upcoming tariffs.

The graph showed the European Union was headed for 20-percent tariffs. China, meanwhile, had been assigned 34 percent. Vietnam would receive 46 percent, and Thailand 36 percent.

Noticeably absent were Mexico and Canada, the US’s two largest trading partners and its immediate neighbours.

Those countries, the White House explained, would remain under punitive tariffs, designed to bring them in line with Trump’s policies on border security.

All goods not covered under the US-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement would face a 25-percent tariff, with the exception of energy products. They face 10-percent tariffs instead.

Wednesday’s announcement, while widely expected, still sent shockwaves across the globe.

“Long story short, this is a historic moment,” said Dan Ciuriak, the director of the Canada-based Ciuriak Consulting firm, giving a nod to the isolationist policies of the Trump administration.

“I think it will reshape the world. I think we are seeing the possibility of the emergence of something like a ‘Fortress North America’.”

He noted that poorer countries in places like Southeast Asia appear to be among the hardest hit by the impending tariffs.

“ The developing countries have been hit by very, very high tariffs. And that will have geopolitical ramifications,” Ciuriak said.

“These countries are the poorest in the world, and the notion that they have been getting rich on the back of American workers is not very tenable. I don’t think that this is going to play well in the rest of the world. So we will see, I think, tectonic shifts in international relations as a result of that.”

Within minutes of Trump’s announcement, the international backlash started to erupt, with world leaders denouncing the sweeping tariffs as unjustified.

“The unilateral action that the Trump administration has taken today against every nation in the world does not come as a surprise,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanesesaidin a news conference. “But let me be clear: They are totally unwarranted.”

Australia faces 10-percent tariffs from the Trump administration. Like many leaders, Albanese pledged to protect his country’s workers from the repercussions of those taxes.

“The administration’s tariffs have no basis in logic, and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership. This is not the act of a friend,” he added.

Ireland’s Taoiseach Micheal Martin, meanwhile, offered a broad message warning of the damage to both global trade relations and to the US’s own consumers.

“I strongly believe that tariffs benefit no one. They’re bad for the world economy. They hurt people. They hurt businesses,” hesaid. “So I regret deeply the decision of the US administration this evening to levy a tariff of 20 percent on all goods imported from the European Union.”

Even Canada, which was exempt from the so-called reciprocal tariffs, chimed in with its outrage over the US’s broader policy of lashing out at longtime trading partners.

“During this crisis, we must act with purpose and force,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carneywroteon social media. “My government will fight U.S. tariffs, protect Canadian workers and industries, and build the strongest economy in the G7.”

Canada is among the countries that have pledged to respond to the Trump administration’s tariffs with retaliatory measures. Other countries, including Mexico, have demurred: Earlier on Wednesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would avoid pursuing “tit-for-tat” tariffs.

Experts say tariffs — a kind of import tax — very often fall on the shoulders of consumers.

Trump has framed his tariffs as a means of reducing trade deficits and bringing foreign manufacturing back to US shores. He also said he plans to use the tariffs to offset the US debt and pave the way for tax cuts.

But critics point out that trade deficits — when the money spent on exports is greater than earnings from imports — are not necessarily a bad thing. They can be a sign of consumer habits or a strong currency.

Opponents of the tariffs also argue that it will take years for new factories to be established in the US, making any economic benefit a distant prospect.

Reporting from the New York Stock Exchange, Al Jazeera correspondent Kristen Saloomey noted that market volatility has been an issue for investors this week, as they braced for the tariffs and the resulting economic uncertainty.

“President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement came after stock markets in the United States had closed in positive territory and immediately sent the futures market into negative territory, signalling another shaky start to the markets on Thursday,” Saloomey said.

What might follow Trump’s announcement, she added, is unclear. Economists have been watching stock market indexes like the S&P 500 for signs of what’s to come.

“Market analysts have been disagreeing as to whether or not we’ve seen the worst of this policy’s impact on markets,” Saloomey explained.

“Some have argued that — with a 10-percent drop in the S&P last month — markets had already priced in the cost of doing business with these tariffs. Others have warned that things might get worse with inflation and even a recession possible in the future as a result of these policies.”

But Trump and his allies have brushed aside fears of an economic downturn. From the Rose Garden, Trump offered a preemptive rebuttal to the foreign leaders who might “complain”.

“To all of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors and everyone else who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs, I say: Terminate your own tariffs. Drop your barriers. Don’t manipulate your currencies,” Trump said.

He also signalled he felt the tariffs were relatively generous, given the abuse he felt the US had faced.

“We are being very kind. We’re kind people, very kind,” he said, before adding: “You are not so kind when you get ripped off.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/2/a-historic-moment-donald-trump-unveils-sweeping-reciprocal-tariffs

tariffs,Trump Tariffs: What products do China and the US buy from each other?,"The United States bought $439bn worth of goods from China in 2024 – more than three times the $143.5bn it sold in return. That $295bn gap, known as the trade deficit, is something US President Donald Trump is determined to shrink.

In an effort to close the gap, Trump has raised tariffs on China to 145 percent. This means Chinese goods sold to the US are now taxed at 2.45 times their original price, making them much more expensive and less competitive in the US market.









China has retaliated with 125 percent levies on US goods.

The tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs between the world’s biggest trading powers has led to uncertainty on what it means for the cost and production of everyday items such as smartphones, semiconductors and clothing.

China’s Ministry of Commercesaidit is willing to “fight to the end” and has accused the US of violating the rules of the World Trade Organization.



February 1

On February 1, President Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on China. The order also placed 25 percent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports.

March 4

The president placed an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods on February 27, which came into effect on March 4.

April 2

A 10 percent tariff was applied to all nations importing goods to the US as well as higher tariffs on select countries, including China that had a 34 percent tariff placed on it.

April 4

China’s Ministry of Finance announced a retaliatory 34 percent tariff on imports from the US.

April 7

President Trump threatened more levies on China’s retaliatory tariffs with an additional 50 percent tariff on Beijing, meaning that China could face 104 percent taxes on all exports.

April 9

China responded with an additional 50 percent tariff on US goods, meaning an additional 84 percent import tax on US goods coming to China.

President Trump later said he would pause reciprocal tariffs for the next 90 days, bringing tariff levels to a baseline 10 percent. However, this did not apply to China; instead, President Trump raised tariffs on exports to 125 percent.

April 10

The White House stated the 125 percent reciprocal tariff on China would be levied in addition to the 20 percent tariff already imposed, bringing the final tariff rate to 145 percent.

On April 11, President Trump said smartphones, laptops and a host of other tech components would besparedfrom so-called “reciprocal tariffs”.

The US Customs and Border Protection agency listed 20 product categories, including all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing equipment. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays.

However, on Sunday, Trump threatened new tariffs on Chinese electronic goods, three days after his administration announced exemptions. On Monday, he advanced plans to introduce tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceutical products.



In 2024, the US sold $143.5bn worth of goods to China.

China’s biggest purchases from the US were mineral fuels, oil seeds, machinery and aircraft. As a single product, soya beans are the largest US export to China, primarily used as pig feed.

In 2024, the US’s main exports to China included:

In 2024, the US bought $439bn worth of goods from China.

China is a major supplier of electrical equipment and electronics including chips, laptops and smartphones to the US.

In 2024, the US’s main imports from China were:

According to the US International Trade Administration, California buys the most of any other state from China. It bought $122.8bn worth of goods in 2024.

Illinois imported the second-most amount of goods from China at $42.1bn, followed by Texas, which bought $35.9bn worth of goods.

Texas sells the most of any other state to China. In 2024, it sold $22.5bn of goods to China. California sold the second-most of any state at $15.1bn, followed by Washington at $12bn.

Explore the table below to see which states import and export the most to and from China.



Miscellaneous manufactured commodities are the leading imports for 15 states, including Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.

These include items like jewellery and for silverware manufacturing, sporting and athletic goods manufacturing, doll, toy, and game manufacturing, and all other miscellaneous manufacturing.

Communications equipment ranks second, being the top import for six states: Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.



Animal slaughtering and processing is the leading export from six states to China, including Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah.

Aerospace products and parts rank second, being the top export from five states: Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky and Ohio.

tariffs,What tariffs are China imposing on the US – and why are they significant?,"China has reacted swiftly to the imposition of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods by United States President Donald Trump.

They went into effect at 05:01 GMT on Tuesday, and moments later, China’s Ministry of Financeannouncedit would impose 15 percent tariffs on imports of US liquid natural gas (LNG) and coal and 10 percent levies on oil, farm equipment and some automobiles.









In addition, China’s Ministry of Commerce and its General Administration of Customs said Beijing will begin imposing export controls on some rare earth minerals and metals central to the booming US tech industry and its green energy industry. China also announced measures against some US businesses.

China set Monday as the start date for its economic countermeasures even though it has already been hit by US tariffs. Trump is expected to speak by phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.

During Trump’s first term as president, China and the US also waged economic warfare in the form of tit-for-tat tariffs that upended the global economy. This time, Trump said he imposed tariffs on China over its role in the flow of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, into the US.

So what are the implications of China’s tariffs against the US? And what can the example of similar moves by Trump against Mexico and Canada tell us about the potential fallout from China’s rebuttal?

On Saturday, the same day that Trumpannounced tariffson China, he also declared that the US would impose 25 percent tariffs on goods coming to the US from its two neighbours, Canada and Mexico.

In addition to a charge of ignoring the flow of fentanyl into the US, he also accused the two neighbouring nations of not doing enough to stop undocumented migration to the US over their borders.

Canada and Mexico responded with brusqueness similar to China’s: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum immediately ordered retaliatory tariffs while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would institute matching 25 percent tariffs on nearly $100bn in US goods.

The rhetoric and threats from the leaders of all three countries escalated until Monday when Trump had calls with both Trudeau and Sheinbaum, after which he announced that he had agreed to a 30-day pause before the tariffs would go into effect.

Trudeau and Sheinbaum, for their part, said they had agreed to enhance efforts to enforce their borders.

As Trump’s call with Xi looms, it appears the Chinese president is giving diplomacy a chance to work as it did in the cases of Canada and Mexico, according to Lynn Song, chief economist for China at the Dutch financial firm ING.

“Delaying the tariff implementation until February 10 will allow for top level leadership to meet before then, which still creates an opportunity for both sides to step back from the brink and de-escalate the situation,” he told Al Jazeera.

But Julien Chaisse, a professor at City University of Hong Kong who specialises in international economic law, said that much will depend on the US and how Trump views China’s decision to threaten retaliatory tariffs.

“If Trump sees this as a direct challenge, his administration could respond with additional trade restrictions. This would intensify the conflict,” he told Al Jazeera.







If diplomacy fails and China, the world’s largest consumer of energy, follows through on its threats to retaliate, the US will be hit with tariffs on its LNG, coal and crude oil in what Song called a “reasonably measured response”.

China’s antimonopoly regulator also announced investigations into Alphabet’s Google while including PVH Corp, the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein, and biotechnology company Illumina on a list of potential companies that could be targeted with sanctions.

Electric trucks imported from the US will also be hit with a 10 percent tariff, potentially impacting Trump ally Elon Musk’s Tesla, which has been promoting its electric trucks in China.

China’s move to curb the export of critical minerals and metals used in things like electronics, military equipment and solar panels comes at a time when Beijing isstrengthening its dominanceover the mining and processing of these materials.

The new controls, which came into effect immediately and are not subject to Monday’s deadline, cover the metals tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium and molybdenum and their related products.

China’s Commerce Ministry said this measure was to “safeguard national security interests”.

While the controls stop short of an outright ban, exports are likely to drop sharply as companies scramble to get export licences, a process that takes roughly six weeks. It’s not clear whether US importers will qualify for licences.

“It is a response with equal magnitude but in a different way than in 2018,” Gary Ng, a senior economist with the investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera, referring to the tariff war the two countries engaged in during Trump’s 2017-2021 first term.

“This time, it is a mix of tariffs on targeted products, export control and restrictions on market access. It means China is using its role as one of the world’s largest markets and producers to bargain with the US.”

China’s moves against US imports target a relatively small percentage of the total goods it brings in from the US, Song said, adding that ING’s initial calculations put this number at 10 to 12 percent based on 2024 data.

The US is a relatively small source of crude oil for China, accounting for 1.7 percent of its imports last year and worth about $6bn. It imported an average of 230,540 barrels per day from the US in 2024, a 52 percent decline from the same period in 2023.

About 5.4 percent of China’s LNG imports come from the US, totalling 4.16 million tonnes last year and worth $2.41bn, customs data showed. China bought about 10 percent of US LNG exports last year.

These LNG purchases, however, are nearly double what they were in 2018, the last time the US and China went toe to toe in a trade war.

The US is not a major source of coal for China. Only 6.4 percent of US coal production goes to China, US export data showed.

The materials Beijing has put export restrictions on have the potential to hit the US harder.

Tungsten is used in the production of things such as artillery shells, armour plating and cutting tools because of its extreme hardness.

About 60 percent of tungsten consumed by the US goes towards tungsten carbide, used in construction, metalworking, and oil and gas drilling. China produced roughly 80 percent of the global supply in 2023.

Also on this list are indium, critical in the production of phone and TV screens, and tellurium, bismuth and molybdenum, essential to things like metalworking.

China is one of the world’s leading producers of all of these materials, setting the US tech and clean energy sectors up for pain.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/4/what-tariffs-is-china-imposing-on-the-us-and-why-are-they-significant
tariffs,"Why did Trump pause Canada, Mexico tariffs? Inside 24 hours of chaos","United States President Donald Trumpannouncedthat he would “immediately pause” tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 30 days after speaking with their leaders on Monday.

However, a 10 percent tariff on all China exports comes into effect on Tuesday.

So what led to this decision, and why was the pause announced?

On February 1, Trump signed executive orders imposing 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, with a partial exemption for Canadian energy and oil exports, and a 10 percent tariff on China.

Trump has also spoken against the high trade deficit in goods with the three countries that together stands at more than $480bn. China, Mexico, and Canada collectively made up more than 40 percent of US imports of goods last year at $1.2 trillion.

He said these tariffs would remain in place until the countries took steps to curb the flow of migrants and drugs, particularly fentanyl, into the US. The tariffs risked increasing the cost of online goods and prompted global market uncertainty over the risk of a sharp slowdown in global growth.

However, on Monday, the leaders of Mexico and Canada struck last-minute deals, pausing the impending tariffs.

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the deployment of 10,000 National Guard officers to the border to curb drug trafficking and migrants into the US after speaking with Trump.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also had two calls with Trump after which he announced a 30-day pause in the US tariffs. In return, Canada has agreed to send forces to the border to fight drug trafficking and undocumented migration as demanded by the new US administration.

Meanwhile, the 10 percent tariff Trump imposed on China took effect at 12:01am EST (05:01 GMT) on Tuesday.

China imposed retaliatory tariffs on a range of US goods and products, including a 15 percent levy on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Beijing also slapped 10 percent tariffs on crude oil imports and farm equipment.

Amid the tariff war, Trump said he intends to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days.

I just had a good call with President Trump. Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan — reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly…

— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau)February 3, 2025



According to experts, the primary objective of the tariffs was “to strategically meet the goals of Trump’s foreign policy and domestic policy, and that was to stopthe flow of the illegal drug fentanylinto the United States”, Al Jazeera’s Kymberly Halkett reported from the White House.

“You have to remember fentanyl is responsible for approximately 70,000 overdose deaths in the US each year. While much attention has been focused on Mexico and the southern border, US officials have also identified Canada and the northern border as key entry points for the drug,” Halkett added.

According to a report by The New York Times, in 2024, US Customs and Border Protection agents seized approximately 19kg (42 pounds) of fentanyl at the northern border, a stark contrast to the nearly 9,600kg (21,164 pounds) intercepted at the US-Mexico border, where cartels mass-produce the drug.

Canada’s McGill University professor of economics Julian Karaguesian suggests that this dispute may not be over.

“It’s possible that President Trump was just trying to not only make a show but actually fulfil a campaign promise and create a flurry of activity to show his base and to show the wider American public that he is not only fulfilling his campaign promises but he is doing it with extreme prejudice,” Karaguesian said.







Trump has repeatedly criticised China for allowing fentanyl to flood into the US, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to curb the supply of both counterfeit and real fentanyl.

China has called the fentanyl crisis “America’s problem”.

“China is one of the world’s toughest countries on counter-narcotics both in terms of policy and its implementation. Fentanyl is an issue for the US. In the spirit of humanity and goodwill, China has given support to the US’s response to this issue,” a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said in a release on Tuesday.

“It’s important to remember that the PRC [People’s Republic of China] was already facing tariffs imposed by the Trump administration during his first term, and the Biden administration never removed them. These new tariffs come on top of those existing measures,” Ja Ian Chong, from the National University of Singapore, told Al Jazeera.

“So far, China has responded relatively calmly, suggesting that a 10 percent tariff is something they can withstand. While the PRC economy has slowed, they have been working to diversify into other markets and boost domestic consumption. We will have to see how that strategy unfolds,” he added.

During his first term in 2018, Trump launched a fierce two-year trade war with China, imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on about $50bn worth of Chinese imports.

“We have a tremendous intellectual property theft problem,” Trump said in 2018. “It’s going to make us a much stronger, much richer nation.”

To end that trade war,China agreed in 2020to increase its annual purchases of US goods by $200bn, but the plan was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Washington’s annual trade deficit with China remained above $300bn, according to Chinese customs data released last month.

China, the world’s second-largest economy, says the “unilateral tariff hike” by the US “seriously violates World Trade Organization rules”. It also launched an anti-monopoly investigation into Google and imposed controls on rare earth exports crucial for the manufacture of semiconductors.

It is not quite clear yet. But analysts say the Trump administration would likely hold negotiations with Mexico in the next 30 days.

“The big concern for Donald Trump is the flow of illegal substance fentanyl as well as illegal immigration into the United States, something that the US president addressed already through an executive order,” Al Jazeera’s Halkett said.

The Al Jazeera correspondent said US officials are going to negotiate the trade deficit with Mexico over the next month. The US trade deficit with Mexico stands at more than $100bn.

At the northern border, Trump said he was very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations, but he was also looking for a “final economic deal”.

“I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final economic deal with Canada can be structured,” Trump posted on social media. “FAIRNESS FOR ALL!”

Trump has also expressed interest in Canada becoming the 51st state of the US, a notion that Trudeau has rejected.

On Monday, Canada also made important announcements.

“Canada had agreed to name Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organisations. We’re going to name a fentanyl ‘tsar’ as a result of the conversation between Prime Minister Trudeau and President Trump. There is the creation of a Canada-US joint strike task force to combat organised crime,” Canada’s McGill University professor of economics Julian Karaguesian said.

“While those commitments by Canada have been successful in getting a one-month delay in the imposition of tariffs,” Karaguesian said, “I don’t personally believe this is the end of the story.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/4/why-did-trump-pause-canada-mexico-tariffs-inside-24-hours-of-chaos
tariffs,"How have Canada, China and Mexico responded to Trump’s tariffs?","US President Donald Trump has pushed into new trade law territory with an emergency sanctions law to justify punishing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and an extra duty on Chinese goods.

Trump signed three separateexecutive orderson Saturday, imposing the tariffs, which have beenglobally criticised.

Here’s what you need to know about Trump’s tariffs and how the affected countries have retaliated.

It imposes a 10 percent bill on all imports from China and a 25 percent levy on goods from Mexico and Canada.

One exception to this is Canadian energy products, including oil, natural gas and electricity, which will be taxed at 10 percent.

The tariffs come with no exceptions, according to White House officials – and would even apply to Canadian imports values less than $800, which are currently duty-free.

Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the taxes, accusing the targeted countries of not doing enough to stop illegal immigration or drug trafficking into the United States.

The aim is to hold them “accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonousfentanyland other drugs from flowing into our country”, the White House said in a statement.

The action makes good on Trump’s repeated campaign threat to impose widespread tariffs, a policy he defends and believes helps generate revenue, protect American jobs and create leverage.

The word “tariff”, Trump has often joked, “is themost beautiful wordin the dictionary”.

Trump has repeatedly said he would like to see Canada become the “51st state”, and in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,Trump called out his country’s northern neighbour.

“We have a tremendous deficit with Canada. We’re not going to have that any more. We can’t do it,” Trump said, teasing another way to avoid the tariffs.

“As you probably know, I say: ‘You can always become a state. And then, if you are a state, we won’t have a deficit. We won’t have to tariff you,’” Trump said.

Tariff collections are to begin at 12:01am EST (05:01 GMT) on Tuesday, according to Trump’s executive orders. But imports that were loaded onto a vessel or onto their final mode of transit before entering the US prior to 12:01am Saturday would be exempt from the duties.

The taxes will stay “until the crisis alleviated”, according to the White House, which provided no specific benchmarks needed for them to be lifted.







Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau begrudgingly announced Ottawa would respond in kind, putting 25 percent tariffs on up to $155bn in US imports.

Those tariffs would include American beer, wine and bourbon, as well as fruits and fruit juices, including orange juice from Trump’s home state of Florida, said Trudeau. Canada would also target goods including clothing, sports equipment and household appliances.

Trudeau questioned why Trump would threaten a historic US-Canada partnership that he said is the strongest “the world has ever seen”.

According to the US government, Canada was the largest buyer of the country’s goods in 2022, accounting for $356.5bn in purchases. An estimated$2.7bnworth of goods and services crossed the US-Canada border each day in 2023.

“The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,” said Trudeau. “We didn’t ask for this, but we will not back down.”

Mark Carney, a frontrunner to replace Trudeau as Canada’s next premier, also slammed the Trump tariffs and said Canada would be “united” and “stand up to a bully”.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Saturday ordered retaliatory tariffs in response to the tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico.

In a lengthy post on X, Sheinbaum said her government sought dialogue rather than confrontation with its top trade partner to the north, but that Mexico had been forced to respond in kind.

“I’ve instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we’ve been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defence of Mexico’s interests,” Sheinbaum posted, without specifying what US goods her government will target.

The US is by far Mexico’s most important foreign market, and Mexico in 2023 overtook China as the top destination for US exports.

Mexico has been preparing possible retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US, ranging from five percent to 20 percent, on pork, cheese, fresh produce, manufactured steel and aluminium, according to sources familiar with the matter. The auto industry would initially be exempt, they said.

Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on X that Trump’s tariffs were a “flagrant violation” of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement — which Trump had himself shepherded in his first term, as a substitute for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

“Plan B is under way,” Ebrard said. “We will win!”

US exports to Mexico accounted for more than $322bn in 2023, Census Bureau data showed, while the US imported more than $475bn worth of Mexican products.

In her post, Sheinbaum also rejected as “slander” the White House’s allegation that drug cartels have an alliance with the Mexican government, a point Trump’s administration used to justify the tariffs.







China’s government has denounced the tariffs and Trump’s demand that Beijing needed to staunch the flow of fentanyl, a deadly opioid, into the US, while leaving the door open for talks with the US that could avoid a deepening conflict.

Beijing will challenge Trump’s tariff at the World Trade Organization (WTO) – a symbolic gesture – and take unspecified “countermeasures” in response to the levy, which takes effect on Tuesday, China’s Finance and Commerce Ministries said.

That response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had marked China’s trade showdown with Trump in his first term as president and repeated the more measured language Beijing has used in recent weeks.

China’s toned-down response marked a contrast with the direct retaliation and heated language from Canada and Mexico.

China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement that Trump’s move “seriously violates” international trade rules, urging the US to “engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation”.

Filing a lawsuit with the WTO could give Beijing a win in messaging by standing up for the rules-based trading system long advocated by US administrations of both parties. Beijing has taken the same step in a challenge to tariffs of up to 45 percent on Chinese-made electric vehicles by the European Union.

At the same time, a WTO appeal poses no immediate cost or threat to Washington.

China’s sharpest pushback was over fentanyl, an area where the administration of former US President Joe Biden had also been urging Beijing to crack down on shipments of the China-made precursor chemicals needed to manufacture the drug.

“Fentanyl is America’s problem,” China’s Foreign Ministry said. “The Chinese side has carried out extensive anti-narcotics cooperation with the United States and achieved remarkable results.”







The closest parallel to Trump’s action was the late President Richard Nixon’s use of IEEPA’s predecessor law, the 1917 Trading With the Enemy Act, to impose a 10 percent across-the-board US tariff in 1971 to stem rising imports amid a balance-of-payments crisis after pulling the dollar off the gold standard.

Courts upheld Nixon’s action, but Jennifer Hillman, a trade law professor at Georgetown University and former World Trade Organization appellate judge, said Trump’s action may not fit the emergency.

The Nixon ruling and reporting requirement language in the IEEPA statute suggest that there needs to be a causal connection between the emergency – fentanyl and migrants – and the remedy: universal tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.

“At least for me, I don’t think there is such a connection in this case,” Hillman said. “The tariffs would not be applied only to fentanyl, so there is not a clear reason why tariffs on all goods are ‘necessary’ to deal with a problem of fentanyl or migrants.”

Nixon’s use had a much clearer connection between the level of imports and the value of the dollar, she added.

Economic experts say the tariffs are likely to slow economic growth for all parties, while likely driving up inflation.

“Until now the market has really been on Trump’s side, but this is something where that could change and the market could challenge him for the first time,” said Mark Malek, chief investment officer of Siebert Financial in the US.

A new analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale laid out the possible damage to the US economy, saying the average household would lose the equivalent of $1,170 in income from the taxes.

Economist and former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that jobs in the “industrial heartland will be lost as American producers can’t compete due to higher input costs”.

He said on X that Canada and Mexico will lose trust in the US and that the effect on the supply chain will be a “strategic gift” for China.

“Bullying doesn’t win over time on the playground or in the international arena,” Summers said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/2/how-have-canada-china-and-mexico-responded-to-trumps-tariffs

tariffs,US suspends tariffs against French goods over digital service tax,"The United States says it will hold off slapping tariffs on French cosmetics, handbags and other imports in retaliation for a digital services tax (DST) Washington says will harm US technology firms, while it investigates similar taxes elsewhere.

The US Trade Representative’s (USTR) office said on Thursday the 25 percent tariffs on imports of the French goods, which are valued at approximately $1.3bn annually and were due to go into effect on Wednesday, would be suspended indefinitely.

Washington had announced the tariffs in July after a US investigation showed a DST unfairly singled out US companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon.

France and other countries view digital service taxes as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of big tech companies which they say profit enormously from local markets while making only limited contributions to public coffers.

USTR said suspending the action against France would allow Washington to pursue a coordinated response in 10 investigations into similar taxes in India, Italy, Britain and other countries. It gave no timeframe for further action.

European leaders and industry groups welcomed the news, saying it would allow more time for talks on a global taxation solution to bear fruit.

“The US Trade Representative has decided to suspend the tariffs in light of the ongoing investigation of similar DSTs adopted or under consideration in ten other jurisdictions,” the agency said in a statement, adding it had not yet determined possible trade actions in the other cases.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the tariffs would not have been “legitimate” under World Trade Organization rules in any case and redoubled his call for a global solution.

“Trade disputes between the United States and Europe … will only make losers, particularly during this time of crisis,” he said.

EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis emphasised Brussels’s willingness to work on a global solution for fair taxation of the sector.

“The EU stands ready to explore all options should the US unilaterally apply these trade measures,” he said.

The reprieve gives US President-elect Joe Biden and his nominee as trade tsar, Katherine Tai, time to work with France and other countries to find a multilateral solution, said Coalition of Services (CSI) Industries.

CSI President Christine Bliss also urged France and other countries named in the USTR investigation to suspend imposition of DSTs and continue working towards a solution.

Nearly 140 countries involved in talks agreed in October to keep negotiating until mid-2021 after discussions stalled as Washington became reluctant to sign up to an international deal ahead of last November’s US presidential election.

The USTR on Wednesday said it had found that digital services taxes adopted by India, Italy and Turkey also discriminated against US companies and were inconsistent with international tax principles, but held off on announcing any specific tariff actions.

The investigations are among several active USTR probes that could lead to tariffs before President Donald Trump leaves office or early in the Biden administration.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/1/8/us-suspends-tariffs-against-french-goods-over-digital-service-tax
tariffs,Did Donald Trump impose ‘the largest tax hike in our lifetime’?,"Politicians and economists say President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff rollout amounted to ahistorictax increase in the United States.

“Donald Trump just imposed the largest tax hike in our lifetime,” Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom posted on X on April 2.

Other Democratic politicians made similar claims, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, US Senator Chuck Schumer, and US Representative Jared Moskowitz, while Republican Mike Pence called it “the largest peacetime tax hike in US history”.

It is clear the change under the April 2 plan is historic. Theglobal tariffsTrump announced target almost every country the US trades with. All countries on the list face a baseline tariff of 10 percent, withothersfacing tariffs as high as 50 percent.

Estimates vary for the tariff hike’s scope, partly because of Trump’s back and forth on specific tariffs, and global market unpredictability. Trump has repeatedly posted on social media that he is negotiating withcountriesover their tariff rates, so plans could shift.

Measuring how much the average tariff rate has increased, Trump’s tariff hike ranks as the biggest in almost a century. Measuring by how much tax revenue the tariffs will bring in, estimates vary.

Five out of the seven estimates Al Jazeera identified rank these new tariffs as the biggest tax increase since 1951, with the most conservative estimate ranking it as the largest since 1982.

Experts say it is fair to call tariffs a tax.

“They are taxes that apply to US imports,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy with the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.

Tariffs are import taxes businesses pay to the federal government when buying goods and materials from other countries. Businesses often pass along that increased cost to consumers.

Reports from economic policy think tanks with a wide range of political views describe tariffs as a regressive tax, meaning lower income groups are hit harder by the rising costs.







Measuring tariff hikes comes with challenges. The tariff rates vary by country and include exemptions for specific goods.

Trump’s tariff policy has been volatile, with tariffs announced and then rapidly pulled back, sometimes within the day. They could change depending on how countries negotiate with the US orrespondwith their own tariffs.

One way to measure this tariff hike’s size is to compare the new average effective tariff rate with historic rates.

Various economic policy groups, including the Tax Foundation, the Yale Budget Lab and JPMorgan Chase, estimated the new tariff rates at 16.5 percent, 22.5 percent and 27 percent. Each rate is the largest in nearly a century.

When Trump took office, the average effective tariff rate was 2.4 percent.

Another way to measure tariffs’ impact is by expected revenue collections. The more revenue the government collects, the bigger the hike.

The Trump administration has argued that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. Economists previously told us it is unlikely high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans.

Some of the largest estimates of tariff revenues have come from the Trump administration. In a March 30 Fox News interview, White House trade adviserPeter Navarrosaid nonautomotive tariffs “are going to raise about $600bn [a year], about $6 trillion over a 10-year period”, with an additional $100bn a year from auto tariffs.

One way economists put these estimates in historical context is by examining increases in tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).

A 2006 Treasury Department report calculated this value for all major tax bills since 1940. Most of the largest tax increases took place during wartime, in the 1940s and 50s.

If tax revenue increased by the amount Navarro estimated, $700bn, it would represent about 2.3 percent of almost $30 trillion US GDP, making it the largest tax increase since 1942.

Navarro did not elaborate on how he arrived at that $700bn figure, but CNN found it would require a 20-25 percent tariff on $3.3 trillion worth of goods, which is how much the US imported in 2024.

Some economists questioned Navarro’s estimate. “Plainly put, the Navarro estimate is flat out wrong,” York told PolitiFact. “Tariffs will reduce imports, and they will mechanically reduce income and payroll tax revenues; if you don’t account for those you significantly oversell how much revenue tariffs will yield.”

The US economy could shrink, imports could drop and other countries could retaliate with their own tariffs, all resulting in lower tax revenue from tariffs.

The Tax Foundation’s revenue estimate for 2025 was lower at $258.4bn, or 0.85 percent of GDP, which would make it the largest tax increase since 1982.

Michael Feroli, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, offered an estimate of $400bn, or about 1.3 percent of GDP. He described this as the largest tax increase since 1968, but based on data from the Treasury Department, 1.3 percent of GDP would make it the highest since 1951.

Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal think tank, told PolitiFact some revenue estimates looked too low. He estimated nearly $1 trillion in tax revenue.

“As a practical matter, some goods are exempted and demand will surely fall, so it won’t be anywhere near that high, but I think even the JPMorgan number is very low,” Baker said.

Five out of seven of the estimates that we identified for Trump’s tariff plan are the highest since 1951.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/4/8/did-donald-trump-impose-the-largest-tax-hike-in-our
tariffs,Why is Trump ‘very angry’ with Putin and who will secondary tariffs hurt?,"United States President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he was “p***** off” at his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and would slap additional financial penalties on the sale of Russian oil if he did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

The comments marked a sharp change in tone from Trump, who has been open to peace negotiations with Moscow since his second term began in January.

Here is more about what happened, what Trump’s threat could involve, and why this is significant for Putin’s war on Ukraine, and for countries that buy Russian oil.

During aninterviewwith NBC on Sunday, Trump said he was “very angry” and “p***** off” over Putin questioning the legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump argued that any move seeking to replace Zelenskyy as the leader of Ukraine would inevitably delay the prospects of a ceasefire.

However, Trump did add that Putin knew he was angry with him. He said he and Putin had “a very good relationship” and “the anger dissipates quickly … if he does the right thing”.

Putin said Zelenskyy lacked the legitimacy to sign a peace agreement.

The Russian leader has frequently claimed that the Ukrainian government is illegitimate, ever since the 2014 overthrow of Moscow-leaning President Viktor Yanukovych, whom the Kremlin claims had US backing.

Putin suggested on Thursday that a temporary administration be established in Ukraine under the supervision of the United Nations. This proposal was rejected by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

Zelenskyy was sworn in as the president of Ukraine in 2019 for a five-year term. The war broke out following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While Ukraine was supposed to have presidential elections in 2024, the country has been undermartial lawdue to the war, and its constitution does not allow it to hold elections under martial law conditions.

Though Trump has now criticised Putin for questioning Zelenskyy’s legitimacy as Ukraine’s president, the American leader did the same not long ago.

In February, amid tensions with the Ukrainian leader, Trump described Zelenskyy as “A Dictator without Elections” in a post on his Truth Social platform.

During his presidential election campaign, Trump promised that he would bring the Ukraine war to a prompt halt.

Since his inauguration, US negotiating teams have separately met Russian and Ukrainian teams multiple times in Saudi Arabia to discuss peace terms. Trump has also separately spoken to Putin and Zelenskyy since then.

The three sides agreed on March 25 to stop using military force in theBlack Sea. They also agreed to pause attacks on energy infrastructure in Russia and Ukraine for30 days. However, both sides have accused each other of violating this and attacking energy facilities.

Ukraine and the US had agreed to a 30-day complete ceasefire on land and sea, which is pending Russia’s approval. Putinhas not signed this proposal, citing reservations that Ukraine might use the period to rearm itself — including with supplies of cutting-edge Western weapons — and mobilise more soldiers at a time when it faces a manpower shortage.

Trump has threatened “secondary tariffs” on Russian oil if he deems Moscow responsible for not reaching a ceasefire agreement.

“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault – which it might not be – but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on all oil coming out of Russia,” said Trump during the NBC interview.

“That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States. There will be a 25 percent tariff on all oil, a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil.”

Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told Al Jazeera that it is unclear whether these threats would place pressure on Russia.

“We have seen sporadic threats by Trump to impose some kind of economic pressure on Russia but they never last long,” said Giles, adding it would be a “radical departure” from his past approach towards the war if Trump were to impose pressure on Moscow, rather than on Kyiv.

“We do not know if this threat is empty, but the previous ones have been, and Putin knows that,” Giles said.

By “secondary tariffs” Trump appears to mean tariffs on imports from countries that buy Russian oil.

The US has long led campaigns of what are known as secondary sanctions — in which countries that trade with a sanctioned country also face sanctions. For instance, secondary sanctions are in place against the purchase of Iranian oil or heavy military equipment from Russia: countries, companies and individuals that engage in this trade are at risk of US sanctions.

The threat of secondary US sanctions is also why most global banks and financial institutions no longer participate in trade with Russia or Iran — they do not want to risk losing out on business in the US.

By contrast, secondary tariffs are relatively untested as a phenomenon. Last week, Trump also imposed a 25 percent secondary tariff on US imports from any country buying oil and gas from Venezuela.

If Trump imposes secondary tariffs on Russian oil, India and China could be hit particularly hard.

India and China are the two biggest buyers of inexpensive Russian crude.

Russian oil constituted 35 percent of India’s overall crude imports in 2024, while it made up 19 percent of China’s oil imports. Turkiye is also an importer of Russian oil — in 2023, as much as 58 percent of its refined petroleum imports came from Russia.

If Trump were to impose these tariffs, it is unclear whether they would be added to existing tariffs or if they would absorb other tariffs already in force.

The US is China’s single biggest export market. In 2024, China sold goods worth $463bn to the US. But Trump has alreadyimposed 20 percent tariffson all imports from China.

India too counts the US as its biggest export market. Indian exports to the US stood at $91bn in 2024. However, Trump has repeatedly railed against India’s high tariffs on US imports.

Turkiye is relatively less exposed. The US is its second-largest export market, after Germany, at $17bn in 2024.

However, Trump has threatened reciprocal, tit-for-tat tariffs from April 2 against all US trading partners.

And if Trump truly cracks down on countries that buy Russian oil, India in particular could find itself under Washington’s scrutiny. That is because India — which has 22 oil refineries, including the world’s largest in Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat — has long been accused of buying subsidised Russian oil, refining it, and selling it to the West, effectively helping Moscow undercut Western sanctions.

In 2023, India exported $55.8bn worth of refined oil products such as petrol and diesel to countries including the US, the United Kingdom, France and Belgium that otherwise have strict sanctions on the import of Russian crude, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC).

Following Canada, India is the second largest exporter of refined oil to the US, making up 7.5 percent of US oil exports as of 2023, OEC data shows.

But India has long argued that by buying Russian oil, it has freed up crude from other sources, such as the Middle East and Africa, for Western nations to buy, keeping global oil prices under control. If oil from Russia — a leading producer — were no longer available to anyone, every nation would need to scramble for limited supplies of crude from elsewhere, driving up prices.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/31/why-is-trump-very-angry-with-putin-and-who-will-secondary-tariffs-hurt
tariffs,"Canada follows US, imposes 100% tariff on EVs imported from China","Canada, following the lead of the United States, says it will impose a 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports and also announces a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and aluminum from China.

On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa was acting to counter what he called China’s intentional, state-directed policy of overcapacity. But he did not specify whether tariffs would be softened or would be the same on US-based Tesla, whose shares were down more than 3 percent on Monday after the announcement.

“I think we all know that China is not playing by the same rules,” he told reporters. The tariffs will be imposed starting October 1.

“What is important about this is we’re doing it in alignment and in parallel with other economies around the world,” Trudeau said on the sidelines of a three-day, closed-door cabinet meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The Chinese embassy in Ottawa was not immediately available for comment.

Overcapacity refers to the rate of industrial capacity in a sector – a lower rate implies surplus production. Chinese EV makers have been accused of using government subsidies to build cars cheaply to flood overseas markets, hurting brands of those countries.

Trudeau said Ottawa will continue to work with the US and other allies to ensure that customers around the world are not unfairly penalised by nonmarket practices of countries such as China.

Ottawa is also looking at further punitive measures, such as tariffs on chips and solar cells, Trudeau said without giving any details.

US President Joe Biden in May announced aquadrupling of tariffson Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent, a doubling of duties on semiconductors and solar cells to 50 percent, and new 25 percent tariffs on lithium-ion batteries and other strategic goods, including steel, to shield firms from excess Chinese production.

The European Union this month imposed tariffs of up to 36.3 percent on imports of Chinese-made EVs.

Ottawa is trying to position Canada as a critical part of the global EV supply chain and had come under pressure from domestic industry to act against China.

“The Canadian and US auto sectors are fully integrated, and it makes sense for Canada to be fully aligned and in lockstep with the US on these tariffs,” Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera. “This is consistent with Canada’s economic and national security agenda. … The question mark right now is how China will react.”







China is Canada’s second largest trading partner although it trails far behind the US. Data from Canada’s largest port in Vancouver show imports of automobiles from China jumped 460 percent annually in 2023 when Tesla started shipping Shanghai-made EVs to Canada.

Tesla does not disclose its Chinese exports to Canada, which began in the first half of 2023. However, vehicle identification codes showed that the Model 3 compact sedan and Model Y crossover models were being exported from its Shanghai Gigafactory to Canada.

“In response to the tariffs, I would expect Tesla would shift its logistics and potentially export autos to Canada from the US,” Seth Goldstein, equity strategist at Morningstar, said.

“The market is likely reacting to the tariffs and weighing a potential profit impact if Tesla has to export vehicles to Canada from its higher-cost production base in the US,” Goldstein said referring to the drop in shares.

The EU imposed a newreduced extra rate tariff of 9 percent for Tesla, lower than the 36.3 percent it had imposed on other Chinese EV imports.

Canada has inked deals worth billions of dollars to bring in top European automakers in all parts of the EV supply chain to bolster its manufacturing heartland.

“We feel vindicated and motivated. Let’s now get to the business of defending our market with the best of Canadian innovation and resolve,” Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, said via email.

Implementation of the US tariffs has been delayed until September, and there is a possibility that planned duties might be softened this week.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/8/26/canada-follows-us-imposes-100-tariff-on-evs-imported-from-china
tariffs,Trump’s tariffs: Which countries will hit back – and which likely won’t?,"US President Donald Trump hasunveiledhis long-awaited “reciprocal”tariff plan, in a move that sent financial markets reeling amid growing fears of a global trade war.

On Wednesday, Trump announced a 10 percent “minimum baseline tariff” on nearly all imports into the United States. Higher duties on targeted countries will be phased in shortly afterwards.

He claimed the new import taxes were designed to reduce trade deficits and bring foreign manufacturing back to US shores. He also said they would pave the way for tax future cuts.

As Trump took aim at a global trading system he said “ripped off” the US, histariffsprompted an immediate backlash, with some of America’s largest trading partners promising countermeasures.

Invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, Trump announced a 10 percent tariff on all countries, scheduled to take effect on April 5.

Then, he revealed there would be“individualised” tariffsfor countries that have large trade surpluses with the US or that impose higher duties on American imports. Those tariffs would come into effect four days later, on April 9.

Trump explained that his team calculated the “individualised” tariffs by taking half of what he claimed those countries charged the US for its exports.



As such, the European Union is headed for 20 percent tariffs, while the United Kingdom has been slapped with a 10 percent levy.

China, meanwhile, had been assigned 34 percent – on top of the 20 percent tariffs that Trump had already imposed on Chinese imports since coming into office on January 20. Vietnam will be tariffed at 46 percent, and Thailand 36 percent.

Mexico and Canada, the US’s two largest trading partners and its immediate neighbours, were missing from the list but they both already face 25 percent tariffs for all exports to the US that are not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade pact.

Reciprocal tariffs will not apply to some goods such as copper, semiconductors, energy, and “certain minerals that are not available in the United States”, according to a White House fact sheet.

Reciprocal tariffs may also be subject to change. According to the White House document, tariffs may be negotiated with trading partners who “take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements”.

“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” Trump told an audience of manufacturing workers, cabinet members and journalists.

“Foreign leaders have stolen our jobs. Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories. And foreign scavengers have torn apart our once-beautiful American dream.”

But he proclaimed that Wednesday would mark a turning point in US history, marking an end to the “vicious attacks” he said the country had weathered.

“April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed,” Trump said.

“We will charge them approximately half of what they are – and have – been charging us. So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal,” Trump said.

“I could have done that, I guess, but it would’ve been tough for a lot of countries. We didn’t want to do that,” he added.

Within minutes of Trump’s announcement, world leaders began denouncing the tariffs as harmful.

China’sMinistry of Commerce promised “countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests” in response to US “bullying,” it said in a statement. US tariffs on China are now effectively at 54 percent.

While Beijing stopped short of saying it would impose retaliatory countermeasures, the statement read “the United States has drawn the so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’ based on subjective and unilateral assessments, which is inconsistent with international trade rules”.

It urged the Trump administration to cancel the tariffs and “properly resolve differences with its trading partners through equal dialogue”.

For once, Beijing and Taipei appeared to be on the same page.

Taiwanlabelled the tariffs “highly unreasonable”. Cabinet spokesperson Michelle Lee said Taipei “deeply regretted” Trump’s announcement of a 32 percent tariff on its exports.

AustralianPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the tariffs were “not the act of a friend” and “totally unwarranted”.

European CommissionPresident Ursula von der Leyen, responding to a new 20 percent tariff on the EU, called the measure a “major blow to the world economy”.

“The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe,” she said, adding groceries, transport and medicine will cost more.

EvenCanada, which was exempt from the latest tariffs, chimed in.

“During this crisis, we must act with purpose”, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carneywroteon social media. “My government will fight US tariffs,” he said.

As reciprocal tariffs won’t kick in until April 9, countries have six days to try to cut a deal with the Trump team. But some may respond with retaliatory tariffs.

Canadais one of several US trading partners which has pledged to respond to tariffs with retaliatory measures.

Meanwhile, theEuropean Unionis “ready for a trade war” with the US and could “attack online services”, French government spokesperson Sophie Primas said.

She said the EU was preparing a two-stage rebuttal, with “an initial response”, to be put in place around mid-April, concerning aluminium and steel.

Then the EU also will target “all products and services”, with the measures probably ready at the end of April, Primas said, adding this was still being discussed.

“China is likely going to release some type of retaliation …,” Nick Marro, a principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit told Al Jazeera.

Mexico, meanwhile, has demurred. On Wednesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would avoid pursuing “tit-for-tat” tariffs.

Similarly,BritishPrime Minister Keir Starmer has ruled out immediate retaliation, promising on Thursday to keep a “cool head … in the coming days”.

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the House of Commons on Thursday that Westminster is in talks with Washington to secure a deal aimed at avoiding or reducing UK tariffs.

In Asia too, few countries would be willing to take on Trump and risk further retaliation, Marro said.

Aside from China, “a lot of other Asian markets aren’t really in a position to retaliate,” owing to the “importance of the US as a source of final demand,” he said.

Dario Perkins, a managing director at TS Lombard – a London-based financial research firm – broadly agreed and said most countries will favour “other policy levers” over retaliatory tariffs.

“I think that central banks will ease monetary policy [by lowering interest rates to try and boost growth],” Perkins told Al Jazeera.

Still, he said that “global trade will be a lot weaker and international supply chains will be shortened. The multilateral era is dying.”

From the US to Asia,markets tumbledas investors braced for sharpest turn towards protectionism by the world’s largest economy since the 1930s.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.6 percent on Wednesday, auguring near-term losses for US companies.

Germany’s DAX index fell by 1.7 percent on Thursday, while the CAC 40 in Paris shed 1.8 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 1.2 percent.

In Asian trading, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index dipped by 4 percent briefly on Thursday, with automakers and banks taking big hits.

As global stocks fell, investors rushed to buy gold – a traditional safe-haven asset during periods of market volatility.

The precious metal hit a record high of $3,167.84 per ounce (28.3g) on Thursday, before paring gains somewhat.

Market players are worried about the dismantling of international supply chains, and the knock-on effects of inflation and even recession,not least in the US.

Goldman Sachs recently raised its estimate for the probability of a US recession during the next 12 months to 35 percent, up from 20 percent previously.

UBS bank circulated a note on Thursday, saying “it’s plausible US real GDP [in 2025] could be compromised by 1.5-2 percent and inflation could rise to close to 5 percent if these tariffs are not reversed soon”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/trumps-tariffs-which-countries-will-hit-back-and-which-likely-wont
tariffs,Mexico and Canada announce one-month pause in threatened Trump tariffs,"Washington, DC –Top international leaders have announced a month-long pause to thesweeping US tariffsthreatened for exports from Mexico and Canada.

The three countries confirmed they had struck agreements delaying the tariffs in social media posts on Monday, a day before the import taxes were supposed to come into effect.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was the first to reveal the pause,writingon the platform X after a call with her US counterpart Donald Trump.

“We had a good conversation with President Trump with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty,” she said.

She explained that, as a result of their discussion, Mexico would send 10,000 National Guard troops to its northern border to “prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States”.

Sheinbaum added that the US was, in return, working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered firearms to Mexico, which has long strengthened organised crime in the country.

Trump followed with his ownannouncement, describing the conversation with Sheinbaum as “very friendly” and praising the deployment of Mexico’s National Guard.

“These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country,” Trump wrote. He did not mention any US efforts to stop gun trafficking to Mexico.

Following two calls with Trump on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced on X that “proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together”.

Trudeau also made several concessions to the US.

In response to Trump’s demands, the Canadian prime minister revealed his government would name a “fentanyl czar”, list Mexican cartels as terrorist groups, and launch a “Canada-US Joint Strike Force to combat organised crime, fentanyl and money laundering”.

The tariff pauses stave off — at least temporarily — two fronts of a brewing global trade war percolated by Trump.

During his 2024 bid for re-election, Trump campaigned heavily on raising tariffs for international goods coming into the US, as a means of bolstering the domestic industry.

After his victory in November, he unveiled a proposal for 25-percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of the US’s top trading partners. He argued that the harsh measures were necessary to crack down on undocumented migration and drug smuggling across US borders.

But economists say the tariffs could be the first salvo in an eventual trade war that could hurt consumers in the US and across the world.







Monday’s announcement, however, only delays the imposition of the US tariffs against Canada and Mexico.

For weeks, the threat of import taxes had led to a game of brinkmanship between the three countries involved.

Mexico had repeatedly said it was prepared to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US, but it has not gone into specifics.

Canada, meanwhile, has been much more explicit with how it would respond to Trump’s promised tariffs. Trudeau said over the weekend his country would impose 25-percent retaliatory tariffs on $105bn worth of US imports.

“I want to speak directly to Americans,” Trudeau said on Saturday. “This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people. As I have consistently said, tariffs against Canada will put your jobs at risk.”

His government released a list of1,256 US itemsthat would be subject to tariffs, including key exports from states with a large proportion of Trump voters. They include oranges from Florida, bourbon from Kentucky and motorcycles made in Pennsylvania.







The economies of Mexico, Canada and the US aredeeply intertwined, with a trade war expected to hit the automotive and agricultural industries particularly hard.

Trump has also pledged a 10-percent increase on tariffs for China, with no changes announced hours before that price hike was set to go into effect.

Experts have repeatedly warned that increased prices would eventually be felt by US consumers.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump himself acknowledged there could be domestic blowback to the plan.

His administration has framed tariffs as a tool for negotiation, and Trump has also said such tariffs are needed to jump-start US industries.

“Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!),” Trumppostedin all capital letters on Sunday.

“But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.”

In a subsequentpost, Trump said that Canada could avoid US tariffs by ceding its sovereignty and becoming “our Cherished 51st State”.







In the lead-up to his second term, Trump campaigned on bringing down the prices of basic consumer goods and boosting US industries.

But experts often point out that the increased costs spurred by tariffs are often transferred to the consumers through higher prices.

Monday’s month-long pause on tariffs with Mexico buys authorities in that country time to negotiate.

Reporting from Mexico City, Al Jazeera correspondent John Holman explained that officials will likely make the case that tariffs will damage not just Mexico, but US businesses, workers and consumers.

“It’s obvious that, in that relationship, Mexico is the junior partner, but Canada, Mexico, the United States have been integrated now for about 30 years,” Holman said.

“There are supply chains in Mexico with auto manufacturing, with fruit and vegetables — about three-quarters of US vegetables actually come from Mexico — that aren’t so easily unpicked,” he said.

Holman added that Sheinbaum will seek to appeal to Trump’s other priorities, like counteracting growing Chinese influence in the world.

“She will try to send the message that we should be working together to make our region rise up against competition from other parts of the world, like China,” he said.

Trump teased that further negotiations with Mexico were already anticipated.

In Monday’s post, he announced that US Secretary of State Marcio Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick would lead the discussions over the next month, “as we attempt to achieve a ‘deal’ between our two countries”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/3/trump-sheinbaum-announce-one-month-pause-in-threatened-mexico-tariffs
tariffs,"China pledges support for economy, dismisses US claims on tariff talks","China’s top leaders have pledged to step up support for the economy stricken by a high-stakes trade war with the United States as Beijing dismisses President Donald Trump’s claims of being engaged in tariffs negotiations.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Friday that the two nations were not engaged in formal talks on the trade war triggered by US tariffs earlier this month.

US duties on Chinese goods now stand at 145 percent, while China’s retaliatory levies on US imports have reached 125 percent.

China insists the US must first lift all “unilateral” tariffs to resolve the trade standoff.

Meanwhile, China’s top policymakers, including President Xi Jinping, convened a meeting on Friday, emphasising support for businesses and workers facing “external shocks”, state news agency Xinhua reported.

They also said they would seek to “work with the international community to actively uphold multilateralism and oppose unilateral bullying practices”, it said.

The readout of the meeting “shows the government is ready to launch new policies when the economy is affected by the external shock”, Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in a note.

However, Zhang noted “it seems Beijing is not in a rush to launch a large stimulus at this stage”.

“It takes time to monitor and evaluate the timing and the size of the trade shock,” he added.







The Reuters news agency reported that China is evaluating exemptions for select US imports, although Beijing has not made any public statement on the issue.

Businesses have been asked to identify essential goods requiring tariff relief, though no official list has been released, the report said.

A leaked document circulating online suggested 131 product categories – including pharmaceuticals and aerospace components – could be exempted.

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China confirmed it had raised the issue with authorities, noting that many firms rely on critical US imports.

Similarly, the American Chamber of Commerce stated some pharmaceutical companies had already received exemptions for specific drugs.

French aerospace firm Safran also reported receiving exemptions for certain aircraft parts. Analysts suggest these moves could ease costs for Chinese firms and reduce pressure on US exporters.

The Commerce Ministry has yet to comment publicly on the exemptions, redirecting inquiries to “relevant authorities”.

Meanwhile, global markets remain watchful for signs of a potential de-escalation from the both the US and China.

tariffs,"EU hikes tariffs on Chinese EVs, prompting rebuke from Beijing","The European Union has decided to sharply raise tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, prompting an angry response from Beijing.

The tariffs of up to 45.3 percent will take effect on Wednesday after an inquiry concluded that Beijing was undercutting European carmakers with unfair state subsidies.

China’s Ministry of Commerce on Wednesday said it did not agree with or accept the tariffs.

“We also noticed that the EU side indicated it would continue to negotiate with China on price commitments,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that Beijing would take “all necessary measures to firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies”.

Beijing, which during the probe accused Brussels of “unfair” and “unreasonable” protectionism, has launched its own investigations into imports of European goods, including dairy and pork products.

The European Commission, which is responsible for the bloc’s trade policy, announced the tariff hikes on Tuesday after negotiations between Brussels and Beijing failed to reach a compromise in their long-running dispute over electric vehicle (EV) sales.

Under the revised trade rules, the bloc will impose tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 17 percent for the Shenzhen-based BYD and 35.3 percent for the Shanghai-headquartered SAIC, on top of a standard 10 percent duty for imported vehicles.

The Commission has argued that state subsidies have enabled Chinese carmakers to unfairly price out their European rivals.

About 19.5 percent of EVs sold in the bloc last year were made in China, with the policy group Transport & Environment predicting Chinese carmakers’ market share to exceed one-quarter in 2024.

EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday that the tariffs were an example of the bloc “standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base”.

“We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field,” Dombrovskis said.

The tariffs have caused controversy within the EU itself, however, with Germany and Hungary raising concerns that the measures could lead to a damaging trade war between the sides.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/10/30/eu-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-prompting-rebuke-from-beijing
tariffs,Trump’s tariffs: The US will now find out just how much it needs Mexico,"After much dithering, President Donald Trump’s administration announced the date on which 25 percent tariffs will be imposed on most goods entering the United States from Mexico and Canada. T-Day is set for February 4 when some retaliatory measures from its neighbours will also take effect.

Americans are now bracing for what they expect will be higher prices on imported goods. So far, the US media have focused mainly on cutesy examples like tequila, avocados and beer, so there is a tendency to underestimate the effects of the tariffs. However, American households will inevitably be hit hard well beyond their alcohol and groceries.









Indeed, imposing tariffs in a region where trade is so deeply integrated is a recipe for disaster. Let us take the case of US-Mexico relations. Mexico is the largest commercial partner for the United States with more than $1.2m worth of goods passing across their shared border every single minute. Yet Mexico’s economic significance is underestimated at every turn because the country is constantly being portrayed to the American public as an impoverished failed narco-state. Indeed, this depiction is exactly the one Trump needed to invoke the emergency powers required to trigger these tariffs.

The US president couldn’t be more wrong when he says the US doesn’t need Mexico. He’s so wrong that by implementing the tariffs, not only will he trigger inflation – because Americans will pay more for the goods the US doesn’t produce – but he will also undermine the very industries he wants to protect. Whatever retaliatory measures the Mexican government decides to pursue will make this even worse for US consumers and various industries.

Even some of the products that the rather superficial analyses on US media focus on – such as beer – demonstrate just how disruptive this irrational move will be. Mexico is a big producer and exporter of beer, but to maintain this industry, it buys 75 percent of US barley exports. Any disruption in beer production in Mexico due to lower demand from its biggest buyer – the US – will inevitably hit US barley producers. The situation is similar for thousands of other products that depend on cross-border supplies.

A Trump supporter might rebut: “Suck it up and drink American. Disrupted supply chains will recover.” This is easier said than done, but assuming it were possible to relocate everything to the US, Americans would still be faced with a disastrous situation.

Take the North American auto industry. It is spread across the region, boosted by the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA), so that vehicles can cross to and from the US and Mexico as each country gradually adds value to each car and truck. The Trumpian logic asserts that tariffs will force automakers to bring back all production to the US and keep all that value for themselves.

It won’t happen, and this is why.

In this industry, high-skilled but low-paid jobs that have proven stubbornly difficult to automate are often done in Mexico. No skilled labourer in the US or Canada would ever accept the wages Mexicans are willing to take, and these workers add crucial parts all along a vehicle’s production. The final result is a car that is affordable but also provides well-paying jobs stateside.

It is thanks to this system that the US is the world’s fifth largest auto exporter and Canada and Mexico are some of its top customers. It is a position the country is only able to keep thanks to skilled Mexican workers keeping the price down. Short of banning all car imports, China and other established, efficient car-making countries could easily undercut Made-in-America vehicles, even with hefty tariffs.

It is also worth noting that if manufacturing relocation to the US were enforced – in a tragic twist of fate given Trump’s mass deportations – companies would be incentivised to hire undocumented labour to skirt minimum wages and lower prices, just as the agricultural and construction industries already do.

Ultimately, Trump is right about one thing. When it comes to North American trade, one side has been subsidising the other. But it hasn’t been the US subsidising Mexico or Canada, as he says. It has been Mexican workers who have been subsidising the US, its corporate profits and its consumers.

There is still a way to fix this.

While Trump and US economic nationalists blame Mexicans for “stealing” their industrial jobs, Mexico has been working to make the entire North American supply chain more robust while addressing US workers’ very real concerns about companies depressing Mexican wages. The Mexican government has done this by doubling the minimum wage and taking steps towards strengthening unions while keeping labour costs competitive.

If American workers truly want to protect their jobs without sinking to Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric, transnational collaboration between unions in the US and Mexico is the right way to bolster workers’ rights on both sides of the border. The review of USMCA in 2026 would be the perfect venue to have this conversation. But if the trade deal does not survive that long, workers will have to take the initiative on their own.

tariffs,"What are Trump’s plans for tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico?","United States President-elect Donald Trump hasthreatened to impose sweeping tariffs on the United States’s three largest trading partners– Canada, Mexico and China – as soon as he takes office on January 20.

While Trump used tariffs during his first term to punish countries such as China for what he said were unfair trade practices, he has cast the latest measures as a response to the flow of illegal drugs and undocumented migrants across the US border.

“Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long-simmering problem,” Trump said on Monday in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

“We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”

Trump said he would sign an executive order imposing a 25 percent tariff on all Mexican and Canadian imports and an “additional” 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods on the first day of his administration.

It was not immediately clear if the proposed tariffs would be in addition to tariffs he floated while on campaign trail.

During his election campaign, Trump said he would impose tariffs of 60 percent or more on imports of Chinese goods and suggested he could impose a tariff of 1,000 percent or higher on vehicles imported from Mexico.

In his announcement on Monday, the president-elect said the tariffs would remain on Mexican and Canadian goods until the “invasion” of drugs and undocumented migrants came to an end.

He said the tariffs would apply to Chinese goods until Beijing took action to stop the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year, into the country.

Some Trump allies have suggested that the president-elect sees the threat of tariffs primarily as a bargaining chip to use in future negotiations with foreign countries.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum held a press conference on Tuesday, in which she said that she planned to send Trump a letter highlighting the importance of their two countries working together.

Sheinbaum warned that the imposition of tariffs would lead to more tariffs, inflation and job losses “until we put our common businesses at risk”.

For his part, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday that he had spoken to Trump in a phone call on Monday evening.

“We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. It was a good call,” Trudeau said. “This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that’s what we’ll do.”

Ontario Premier Doug Ford issued a more direct warning, saying the tariffs would be “devastating to workers and jobs in both the US and Canada”.

“The federal government needs to take the situation at our border seriously. We need a Team Canada approach and response – and we need it now. Prime Minister Trudeau must call an urgent meeting with all premiers,” Ford said in a post on X.

China’s embassy in Washington said a trade war would not benefit either side.

“About the issue of US tariffs on China, China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature,” spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement.

The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso slipped to their lowest level against US dollar since 2020 and 2022, respectively, after Trump’s announcement.

China’s yuan weakened to its lowest level since July.

Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, the Korean won and the Australian dollar, also fell.

Most of Asia’s major stock indexes fell, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.96 percent at one point on Tuesday.

Markets will be taking note that Trump appears serious about reducing the US trade deficit with other countries, said Steve Okun, founder and CEO of Singapore-based APAC Advisors.

China, Mexico and Canada are the US’s three biggest trading partners, accounting for $830bn of US exports and $1.43 trillion of US imports, respectively, in 2022, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.

The US imports more than it exports in the case of all three countries.

Last year, the trade deficit stood at $67.9bn for Canada, $152.4bn for Mexico, and $279.4bn for China, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The fact that the US has a trade deficit with many of its trading partners has preoccupied Trump since his first term in office and was cited as part of his rationale for initiating a trade war with China in 2018.

“What the rest of the world should take from this is that Trump views relationships on a bilateral perspective and Trump views relationships based on whether the US has a trade deficit or a trade surplus with a given country,” Okun told Al Jazeera.

“If the US has a trade deficit with a country, you address the deficit, typically through tariffs.”

The immediate impact would be to make it more expensive for companies in Canada, Mexico and China to export goods to the US, cutting into their bottom line.

Companies, in turn, are likely to pass these higher costs on to customers, leading to higher prices.

The tariffs would likely have a serious impact on Mexico’s auto industry in particular, as the Central American country is home to manufacturing plants for Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda and Kia, as well as a number of Chinese auto part suppliers.

The tariffs would also hit Asian tech companies such as Foxconn, Nvidia, Lenovo and LG, which expanded their footprint in Mexico with server facilities and factories that produce everything from electric vehicle parts to flat-screen TVs.

Canadian media reported that even a 10 percent tariff could result in $21bn (Canadian $30 billion) a year in economic costs, citing previous estimates from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

The country’s main exports to the US are petroleum, gas and vehicles.

In the longer term, tariffs would have an inflationary impact in the US and negatively affect global trade, according to Gary Ng, senior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong.

“The tariffs can lead to higher inflation in the US, meaning the Fed will find it harder to cut rates,” Ng told Al Jazeera, referring to the US central bank.

“Therefore, the direct implication is that the dollar will remain strong, and global central banks will find it hard to relax policies unless they accept currency depreciation … This is positive for US growth in the short run but bad for the rest of the world.”

Some analysts believe Trump is using tariffs to signal to Canada and Mexico that he intends to renegotiate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a free trade agreement that he signed in 2020 as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Although the USMCA updated the terms of trade in some areas, it largely kept NAFTA’s original provisions in place.

“Trump has made very clear that USMCA is something that needs to be relooked at and renegotiated when he becomes president. You could look at these tariffs on Mexico and Canada as a precursor to a renegotiation,” Okun said.

Tim Harcourt, chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy and Governance at the University of Technology Sydney, said the tariffs would effectively end free trade among the US, Canada and Mexico.

“The president-elect says it’s based on banning the drug fentanyl by halting trade – or providing a disincentive – and immigration, but non-fentanyl goods will get caught in the crossfire,” Harcourt told Al Jazeera.

tariffs,"India, UK agree ‘historic’ trade deal including tariff cuts","India and the United Kingdom have agreed to a trade deal that comes after three years of negotiations and that they say will boost their economies amid the fallout fromUS President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The British government said on Tuesday that the deal “is expected to increase bilateral trade by 25.5 billion pounds [$34bn], UK GDP by 4.8 billion pounds [$6.4bn] and wages by 2.2 billion pounds [$2.9bn] each year in the long run”.

“Indian tariffs will be slashed, locking in reductions on 90 percent of tariff lines, with 85 percent of these becoming fully tariff-free within a decade.”

The British alcohol and car industries are some of the main beneficiaries, with tariffs on whisky and gin getting halved to 75 percent before reducing to 40 percent by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will go from over 100 percent to 10 percent under a quota.

Tariffs will also be reduced on British exports including cosmetics, medical devices, aerospace parts, lamb, salmon, chocolate, and biscuits.

India’s Trade Ministry said 99 percent ofIndian exportswould face no import duty under the deal.

“This brings us closer to our goal of becoming a global economic powerhouse. It protects our core interests while opening doors to India’s greater participation in global value chains,” Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said.

The deal introduces a “Double Contribution Convention” that exempts Indian workers in the UK from national insurance payments for up to three years, and vice versa.

Advanced negotiations on a separate bilateral investment treaty and further discussions on labour and environmental standards are ongoing as well.







India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Keir Starmer spoke on the phone on Tuesday to mark the agreement, and Modi invited Starmer to visit the country.

“These landmark agreements will further deepen our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies,” Modi said in a post on X.

“Strengthening our alliances and reducing trade barriers with economies around the world is part of our Plan for Change to deliver a stronger and more secure economy here at home,” said Starmer, hailing what the government says is theUK’s largest trade agreement since leaving the European Union in 2020.

The two leaders are expected to meet in the coming months to sign and finalise the deal.

India also sought to receive an exemption from the UK’s forthcoming carbon tax – a climate policy tool set to be implemented from 2027 – but officials did not elaborate on the details in their statements on Tuesday.

tariffs,"Did Trump really ‘exempt’ Chinese phones, chips from tariffs?","United States President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs on Chinese electronic goods, three days after his administrationannounced exemptionson smartphones, laptops, flash drives and a host of other tech products from levies he has announced since April 2.

Those exemptions provided relief to US tech companies reliant on Chinese manufacturing, like Apple and chip company Nvidia, which saw their stocks rise considerably after the release of Friday’s notice.

Then came Monday’s announcement, which sparked criticism of Trump over hisback-and-forth tariffs– after suggestions from his opponents and some experts that he had in effect withdrawn many of the steep tariffs previously imposed on China.

But the latest tariffs that the Trump administration partially rolled back on Friday are only part of the most recent levies imposed on Chinese electronics as part of an ongoing, dizzying tit-for-tat tariff dispute that has been playing out in recent weeks between the world’s two largest economies.

In fact, this tense tariff tussle predates Trump’s current term and is rooted in his first stint in office and former President Joe Biden’s own imposition of duties on Chinese goods.

So what tariffs did the Trump administration pull back over the weekend? Are Chinese electronics still subject to US tariffs? How much are they? And how is Trump responding to criticism of the rollback?

After dramaticback-and-forth tariff hikesbetween the US and China through last week,Washington appeared to bend on Friday.

Anoticeissued by US Customs and Border Protection on Friday listed more than a dozen product categories that would be exempted from the wave oftariffsthat Trump has imposed on China since April 2.

They included computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing equipment, products that are largely not made in the US but in China. Smartphones, memory cards, semiconductor devices, solar cells, modems, routers and flat panel displays were also included on the exemptions list.

Friday’s notice specifically mentioned exemptions for these products from tariffs imposed on China on April 2, Tuesday and Wednesday.

The April 2 tariffs raised the duties on all Chinese goods from 20 percent to 54 percent. On Tuesday, Trump announced another 50 percent increase, taking the total tariff rate to 104 percent. Then, a day later, after China increased tariffs on US products to 84 percent, Trump raised duties on imports from China to 145 percent.

An analysis by the finance firm Capital Economics concluded that Trump did Apple CEO Tim Cook “a solid” favour with the exemptions. The exemptions covered goods that accounted for 23 percent of US imports from China, the firm concluded.

After criticism of Friday’s waivers, Trump iterated that China was not being exempt from tariffs.

“NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances, and Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform.

Top officials also insisted that any tariff exemptions that Chinese electronics would benefit from are temporary.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told journalists Chinese electronics were now exempt from sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs initially imposed by Trump on dozens of countries on April 2 but the goods would still face forthcoming levies that are being prepared.

“[Electronics are] exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC News on Sunday.

Trump then changed that timeline – dramatically. He declared he would announce new tariffs on semiconductors from China on Monday.



Not at all.

The Trump administration only rolled back tariffs imposed since April 2 on select electronics.

Electronics imported by the US – including iPhones, laptops and other gadgets – still face at least the 20 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on all Chinese goods from January 20, the day he took office for the second time, to April 2.

On February 1, Trump imposed a 10 percent tax on all Chinese goods. He raised that by another 10 percent on March 4, bringing a baseline surcharge on Chinese goods to 20 percent.

And the tariff exemption announced on Friday on semiconductor products is a bit of a mirage too.

Even before Trump took office, Biden had introduced a 50 percent tariff on all Chinese semiconductors, which took effect on January 1. Trump has not removed that duty. Most electronic goods that the US imports from China, including smartphones and laptops, run on these semiconductors. It is unclear whether they too might face the brunt of the tariffs on semiconductors.

Additionally, a series of Biden-era sanctions on Chinese semiconductor companies, limiting their access to high-end chips, remains in force.

Trump has said he plans to impose new tariffs on Chinese electronics on Monday. He also upped the rhetoric against Beijing, saying his administration would launch a “National Security Tariff Investigation” to look into the US semiconductors supply chain and China’s role in it.

China is the largest source for semiconductor chips in the world. In 2023 and 2024, the biggest markets for its chip exports were the US ($647m), Singapore ($128m) and Italy ($83.5m), according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity.

Speaking to CNN, the director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, explained that the US would investigate the semiconductor supply chain before more tariffs are placed on that industry. Under US trade law, the president has powers to restrict the trade of products seen as critical to national security after an investigation has been concluded.

“Semiconductors are the key, important part of a lot of defence equipment. There’s going to be a semiconductor 232 that studies those things carefully and decides what has to be on-shored in order to protect America,” Hassett told CNN on Sunday, referring to Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act.

The latest salvoes over electronic gadgets and semiconductors are a subplot to a larger trade war that the US and China have escalated in recent days, placingretaliatory tariffson each other since Trump’s April 2 announcement.

Chinese exports to the US – other than the electronic goods exempted on Friday – presently carry a 145 percent levy. US goods entering China carry a 125 percent surcharge.

Countries have scrambled to negotiate better deals with Washington since the sweeping tariffs were announced. Last week, the USpaused additional tariffson most countries for 90 days, instead imposing a flat 10 percent tariff on all their goods

China – which has declared a “fight to the end” – was not included in those deals.

Markets have been volatile since Trump announced his tariffs. The president has insisted that stock market turbulence is the “short-term” consequence of resetting the global trade order, which would ultimately prove rewarding to US consumers.

However, as expectations of a surge in inflation grow, experts said the US exemptions announced on Friday demonstrated an increasing awareness within the administration of the pain that thetariffshave in store for US manufacturers and consumers.

Apple is only one of many US companies on edge during the trade war. The majority of its iPhones – about 90 percent – are assembled in China through its local partner, Foxconn. China produces an estimated 80 percent of Apple’s products.

Lobbying groups representing tech companies Intel, Nvidia and other companies have urged Washington to negotiate trade deals that would lower trade barriers globally.

Other sectors have been impacted too.

In March, Trump placed a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminium imports from all countries, including China. Beijing is the world’s largest steel and aluminium producer. Direct steel exports to the US in 2024 accounted for only about 4.1 percent of its total production. Aluminium exports to the US were higher at 16 percent of China’s total production in 2024.

Then, on April 3, the Trump administration announced a 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles. China was again impacted: Beijing is the world’s biggest car manufacturer. Although its auto exports to the US accounted for about 2 percent of total US auto imports – or just 0.4 percent of auto sales in 2024, according to the credit rating firm S&P, Chinese automakers are so integrated into the global supply chain that new tariffs from any one country could impact them negatively.

On May 3, 25 percent tariffs on all imported auto parts also kick in.

Although Trump administration officials have suggested Americans can avoid a price increase on foreign cars by buying ones that are made domestically, experts have warned thatno car manufactured in the USrelies entirely on American parts.

tariffs,Trump warns China ‘not getting off the hook’ on US tariffs for electronics,"United States President Donald Trump has said that no one is “getting off the hook” on trade after his administration appeared to dial down pressure on China by issuing a notice exemptingcertain high-techproducts from his “reciprocal” tariffs.

In the latest twist in the Trump administration’strade waron Sunday, the president said that there were no exceptions to the tariffs, as smartphones, laptops and other products were still subject to an existing 20 percent duty and the items were being moved to a different tariff “bucket”.

“We will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One later on Sunday, Trump said he would announce new tariffs on semiconductors over the next week.

“The tariffs will be in place in the not distant future,” Trump said, adding that there would be flexibility for some companies in the sector.

US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said earlier that the reprieve for high-tech products, many of which are manufactured in China, would be temporary and that semiconductor tariffs would be in place within weeks.

“So what [Trump is] doing is he’s saying they’re [high-tech products] exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two. So these are coming soon,” Lutnick told ABC News.

Tit-for-tat trade salvoes between the US and China have seen Washington raise import taxes on Chinese goods to 145 percent and Beijing retaliate with a125 percent dutyon US imports.

Beijing initiallywelcomed Washington’s exemptions, describing them as a “small step” in the right direction, while calling on the Trump administration to “completely cancel” the tariffs.

In a notice issued on Friday, US Customs and Border Protection listed 20 broadly definedcategories of high-techproducts not subject to the “reciprocal” tariffs, including semiconductors, flat panel displays and computers.

“What is new is the apparent classification of goods as ‘semiconductors’. The list released on Friday night is much broader than what anyone else would call semiconductor,” Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera.

Trump’s latest comments appeared to pour cold water on hopes of a de-escalation in tensions between the world’s two largest economies.

The remarks also added to widespread confusion about Trump’s trade policies, which have cast a pall of uncertainty over businesses and unnerved financial markets.

“The mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory and demand,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors on Sunday.

The US president has sent global stock markets on arollercoaster ridein recent weeks with a dizzying series of back-and-forth announcements on tariffs.

After his April 2 announcement of sweeping tariffs on dozens of trade partners sentstock markets into freefall, Trump last week abruptly announced a 90-day pause on most of the measures.

The reprieve did not include China, the US’s third-largest trade partner, which was instead hit with even higher tariffs.

The White House has said that Trump remains optimistic about securing a trade deal with China, although administration officials have made it clear they expect Beijing to reach out first.

On Sunday, US stock futures – which are traded outside of regular market hours – moved higher, with those tied to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite up about 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, as of 10pm EST (03:00 GMT Monday).",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/13/trump-warns-china-not-getting-off-the-hook-on-us-tariffs-for-electronics
tariffs,Turkey doubles tariffs on some US goods amid rising tensions,"Turkeydoubled tariffs on some imports from theUnited States– such as passenger cars, alcohol and tobacco – in what it said was retaliation for “deliberate attacks” on its economy.

The development on Wednesday comes amidescalatingtensions between Turkey and the US, itsNATOally.









A decree published in Turkey’s official gazette and signed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doubled the tariffs on passenger cars to 120 percent, on alcoholic drinks to 140 percent, and on tobacco to 60 percent.

Tariffs were also doubled on goods such as cosmetics, rice and coal.

“The import duties were increased on some products, under the principle of reciprocity, in response to the US administration’s deliberate attacks on our economy,” Turkey’s Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote in a Twitter post.

Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan said the doubling of customs tariffs would amount to $533m.









Turkey is currently in the middle of a severe financialcrisiswith the collapse of its currency in recent days. The Turkish lira has lost more than 45 percent of its value since 2017.

Erdogan said on Tuesday his country would boycott all American-made electronic products, including US-made iPhones.

On Monday, the Turkish currency hit a record low of 7.24 against the US dollar in Asia Pacific trading.

But on Wednesday, the lira rallied six percent to below 6.0 against the greenback, boosted by a banking watchdog move on swap transactions and expectations of improved Turkey-EU ties after Turkey released two Greek soldiers detained since March.

“They are squeezing lira liquidity out of the system now and pushing interest rates higher,” said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities.

“Rates have gone up by 10 percent… The central bank has not done this through a change in the benchmark rates, but they are squeezing liquidity, so the result is the same.”

Tim Ash, an analyst from Bluebay Asset Management, wrote in a client note:“Remarkable turnaround.They are killing offshore lira liquidity to stop foreigners shorting the lira.”

Tit-for-tat

The crisis came days after US President Donald Trumpannounceda doubling of steel and aluminium tariffs on Turkey, as Washington pushes Ankara to release Evangelical Christian pastor Andrew Brunson, who is being held on terrorism charges for nearly two years.

A Turkish court on Wednesday rejected an appeal for Brunson’s release.

Earlier this month, Erdoganorderedthe assets of two US officials frozen in retaliation forsanctions imposedon Turkey’s justice and interior ministers over the US pastor’s detention.

Analysts say the financial crisis has been a long time coming and reflects Turkey’s refusal to raise interest rates to curb double-digit inflation and cool an overheated economy. But the latest row with the US also contributed to the lira’s plunge.

Erdogan, rejecting economic fundamentals as the cause of lira weakness, said Turkey was the target of an economic war. He urged Turks to sell their dollars and euros to shore up the national currency, and pressed manufacturers to hold back on buying dollars.

The Turkish leader also accused the US of stabbing Turkey “in the back”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2018/8/15/turkey-doubles-tariffs-on-some-us-goods-amid-rising-tensions
tariffs,Trump launches reciprocal tariffs amid concerns of economic turmoil,"United States PresidentDonald Trumphas signed a plan rolling out increased import duties for every trading partner that taxes US imports, stating that he was doing so to bring a sense of “fairness” to commerce.

Sitting in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump described the tariffs as reciprocal, meaning that the US would automatically raise its own import taxes to match existing levels in other countries.

“On trade I have decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them. No more, no less,” he said.

“In almost all cases, they’re charging us vastly more than we charge them,” he added. “But those days are over.”

While experts have raised concerns that Trump’s tariffs could set off aglobal trade warthat would cause surging prices, Trump has long viewed trade as a matter of winners and losers — and he has argued that the US has been “very unfairly” treated by its allies abroad.

His heavy reliance on tariffs has also been seen as a departure from the longstanding bipartisan consensus on expanding free trade agreements with other countries.

Thursday’s tariffs are not expected to start immediately because it would require different tax hikes be set according to rates in different countries, a process that could take weeks.









Also on Thursday, he threatened the 10-country bloc known as BRICS — named for its founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China — with a “100-percent tariff at least” if the group proceeded with hypothetical plans to set up a common currency.

No such currency is in the works although BRICS leaders have floated the possibility in the past.

Still, Trump lashed out at the prospect in a question-and-answer session with reporters, accusing BRICS leaders of wanting “to play games with the dollar”.

“If any trading gets through, it’ll be 100-percent tariff at least,” Trump said.

The US president has frequently used tariffs as a means of coercing other countries to act in line with his priorities.

That includes proposed tariffs againstMexico and Canada, two of the US’s largest and closest trading partners. In November, shortly after his re-election, Trump announced he planned to impose 25-percent tariffs on both countries to force them to tighten security along the US border.

Economists and politicians alike warned of the crippling effects those tariffs could have on the economies of all countries involved.

“I want to speak directly to Americans,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on February 1.

“Tariffs against Canada will put your jobs at risk, potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities. They will raise costs for you, including food at the grocery stores and gas at the pump.”

Shortly after that statement, both Mexico and Canada struck deals with the Trump team to delay the tariffs until March, in exchange for concessions like an increase in the number of Mexican national guard forces at the southern US border.

Still, Trudeau and other critics have called the prospect of tariffs a violation of the free trade agreements they struck, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was negotiated during Trump’s first term.

Also during Trump’s first term, Congress voted to extend permanent normal trade relations with China.

That decision, and free trade agreements in general, have been criticised by politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders, who argue those policies made it easier for companies to relocate factories to countries with lower wages and reduces unionisation rights and environmental protections.

While Trump has also been critical of free trade deals, he has declined to pursue typically left-wing priorities such as the promotion ofcollective bargainingrights for workers.

Tariffs can also be used to shield domestic sectors from foreign competition, but economists said that strategy is more typical of countries working to get domestic industries off the ground.

They also warned that after several decades of economic integration between allies, the sudden imposition of steep tariffs could lead to seriouseconomic turmoilas well as rising prices for consumers.

Trump campaigned on lowering the cost of living, and he has since warned there may be some “pain” for consumers as a result of the tariffs.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/13/trump-launches-reciprocal-tariffs-amid-concerns-of-economic-turmoil
tariffs,Can Donald Trump enact tariffs without Congress? And can anyone stop him?,"US President-elect Donald Trump – who during the campaign called tariff “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – wasted little time after his election win before proposing even more stringent tariffs on US trading partners.

Trump’s campaign promises included adding a10 percent to 20 percenttariff on all non-domestic goods sold in the United States, a 60 percent tariff on goods from China and reciprocal tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on the US. Then, on November 25, Trumppromisednew 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10 percent tariff on China.

Economists say that Trump following through on these promises could reactivate inflation, a key issue Trump rode to victory in the 2024 election.

Our review of academic studies of real-world tariffs concluded that consumers ultimately shoulder most of the burden in higher prices for goods, and the burden outweighs tariffs’ economic benefits. There is near consensus among economists on this question, surveys show.

Independent groups have estimated that Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost a typical family from $2,000 to $4,000 annually, estimates that were calculated before the most recent tariff proposals.

If fully applied, the new North American tariffs could raisegrocery prices, given that Mexico accounted for 69 percent of US vegetable imports and 51 percent of fresh fruit imports in 2022. New tariffs on Canada could also spike gasoline prices, especially in the upper Midwest, which relies on Canadian crude oil imports. Construction prices could rise, too; one-quarter of the lumber used in the US comes from Canada, and both Canada and Mexico supply cement, metals, machinery and other home-building necessities.

Supply chains for these and other goods could not quickly switch to domestic sources, which would force consumers to pay more or skip buying what they don’t absolutely need.

If Trump wants to follow through on the tariffs, there may be no way to stop him. Experts say he could act unilaterally, without support from a Congress that’s perhaps more ambivalent about tariffs than he is. Agricultural states, which hold significant sway in the Senate, worry about retaliatory tariffs by US trading partners that could blow up longstanding export markets.

“There appear to be few practical or legal barriers to Trump making good on his campaign promise,” concluded trade specialists Warren Maruyama, Lyric Galvin and William A Reinsch with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank focusing on national security.







A tariff is, in effect, a tax on imported goods. More than a century ago, tariffs accounted for most of the federal government’s revenue, but in recent decades, domestic taxes have become the primary federal income source. After 70 years of international negotiations to promote free trade, tariffs have recently hovered at about 2 percent of total federal revenue, according to the Congressional Research Service.

After Trump was elected in 2016, he unilaterally ordered tariff increases, totalling an estimated $80bn, on items such as steel, aluminium, washing machines, solar panels and a variety of goods from China. As a result, foreign tariffs collected by the federal government doubled between 2015 and 2020, to $74bn. When Joe Biden defeated Trump in 2020’s presidential election, Biden retained many of Trump’s tariffs.

It remains to be seen whether Trump intends to follow through or whether raising the spectre of tariffs is a tactic to win concessions from those countries.

According to Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress holds the power to impose tariffs, not the president.

However, over the years, Congress has passed multiple laws ceding some of that power to the president.

“Legally, there is no distinction between Congress imposing tariffs and a president who imposes tariffs operating within law,” said Ross E Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist specialising in trade.

Tariff-applicable powers available to Trump include:

Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which lets the president impose tariffs if national security is threatened. Trump has already used this authority for hissteel and aluminium tariffs, some of which Biden retained.

“While some argue that it would be a stretch for Trump to claim that all imports are a threat to US national security under Section 232, the courts have routinely deferred to presidents on foreign affairs and trade policy, and legal challenges to the Section 232 tariffs haven’t gone anywhere,” Maruyama, Galvin and Reinsch wrote for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows tariffs when the president determines that a foreign country “is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce” through violations of trade agreements. Trump used this authority for some of his first-term tariffs on China and on civil aircraft from the European Union; Biden used it for tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and other technology products.

Section 301 requires a determination by the Office of the US Trade Representative; Section 232 requires an investigation by the Commerce Department. But “these procedural niceties could be accomplished in relatively short order by cabinet officials,” Maruyama, Galvin and Reinsch wrote.

Tariffs on China would be “easiest to impose” using Section 301 authority, said Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist.

Burkhart said: “Congress is unlikely to raise a great deal of objection to tariffs on China. The public tends to view China’s trade policies with the US as being unfair, which makes this an easier tariff to implement.”

Section 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act,which hasn’t been used for decades but which could allow the president to place up to a 50 percent tariff on foreign goods if the US International Trade Commission finds that the foreign country has used unfair trade practices against the US.

Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act,which allows the president to add a 15 percent tariff on imports for 150 days given “large and serious” deficits in the US balance of payments with other nations or to prevent “an imminent and significant depreciation of the dollar” in foreign exchange markets.

Section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,which allows tariffs on all imports during war or an emergency. Declaring such an emergency would require only an executive order from Trump. Trump threatened to use this authority in 2019 against Mexico, citing illegal immigration into the US, but later that year, the two countries came to an agreement on immigration policy that headed off its use.

Alan Wm Wolff, a Peterson Institute for International Economics senior researcher, has written that an overly broad application of Section 203 – to “allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas – would be “too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute”.

But Maruyama, Galvin and Reinsch argued that the law’s language is broad enough to fit Trump’s needs. “It is not a stretch” to imagine Trump expanding the law to address large US trade deficits, they wrote.







These five provisions allow Trump substantial leeway on trade policy – and there’s no surefire way to stop him, experts said.

Tariff opponents could sue, but legal challenges would face “a steep uphill climb”, Maruyama, Galvin and Reinsch wrote. “The courts, including the Supreme Court, traditionally have been reluctant to interfere with the president’s exercise of foreign affairs and tariff powers.”

The US Court of International Trade rejected some of Trump’s unilateral tariff proposals in his first presidency, but it’s unclear how that court would rule on these new proposals, Kent Jones, a Babson College emeritus economics professor, said.

US trading partners could challenge Trump’s policies at the World Trade Organization, the international arbiter for trade, but this hasn’t swayed him. “President Trump has often stated that he does not consider WTO rules or any other trade agreements to be binding on the US, and this consideration would be unlikely to constrain his decision to impose unilateral tariffs,” Jones said.

Congress could pass legislation to limit Trump’s tariffs or use the threat of doing so as leverage. If the tariffs are as broad and deep as Trump has recommended, deep-pocketed businesses might press lawmakers to oppose them.

“The sheer magnitude of a global tariff will make businesses squeamish,” Burkhart said. “These are large lobbying constituencies on Capitol Hill, and they will surely make a lot of noise when a global tariff is proclaimed by President Trump, no matter the legal circumstances under which such a tariff is justified.”

However, both the Senate and the House have Republican majorities. And Trump could strategically exempt certain companies to divide and weaken his opposition.

“By playing favourites on tariff exemptions, the government can distribute rewards to friendly or compliant companies,” Jones said.

The most likely, and potentially most effective, response would be for foreign countries to raise their own tariffs on US goods, ratcheting up the economic pain for the US.

Widespread economic damage, particularly from inflated prices, could lead to an electoral reversal of fortune for Trump and might be the only lever that works in the end, experts said.

“The biggest pushback against unilateral, across-the-board tariffs would likely come from US consumers and US retailers and distributors that purchase the imports, since their prices are likely to jump significantly, probably by close to the full amount of the tariffs,” Jones said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/3/can-donald-trump-enact-tariffs-without-congress-and-can-anyone-stop-him
tariffs,Hong Kong stock market plunges most since ’97 crisis amid tariffs panic,"Hong Kong’s stock market has suffered its steepest single-day decline in nearly three decades amid a wave of panic selling brought on by United States President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements.

The financial hub’s benchmark Hang Seng Index closed down 13.22 percent on Monday, after plunging as much as 13.74 percent during the day.

It was the sharpest plunge for Hong Kong stocks since the index tumbled 13.7 percent in a single day during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

On the worst day for Hong Kong stocks during the 2007-09 global financial crisis, the index fell 12.7 percent.

The rout came after Trump doubled down on his sweeping tariffs overnight, likening the measures to “medicine”, and following China’s announcement last week that it would retaliate with a 34 percent tariff on US imports.

“Friday was a public holiday in Hong Kong, so what we are seeing is the reaction to Trump’s tariffs and China’s retaliation. So it’s a double whammy,” Carlos Casanova, a senior economist with UBP in Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera.

“To put this into context, previous retaliatory measures targeted less than 1 percent of China’s total imports. The magnitude of the last measures is unprecedented,” Casanova said.

“We’re in uncharted territory.”

Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, said the dip in Hong Kong offered a more accurate gauge of the market’s expectations for how the tariffs will affect China’s economy than the stock markets on the Chinese mainland.

“The point is, you cannot trade freely in China. You cannot short Chinese stocks. You can do all of that in Hong Kong. So it’s obviously reflecting what is going on much better than Chinese stocks,” Garcia-Herrero told Al Jazeera.

Hong Kong stocks were by far the worst performers on a dismal day overall for Asia’s markets, with equities in mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and Singapore all suffering steep declines.

Global stock markets have shed trillions of dollars in value since Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on almost all countries on Wednesday.

US customs authorities began imposing a baseline tariff of 10 percent on imports on Sunday, with steeper duties of between 11 percent and 50 percent set to go into effect on Wednesday.

US stocks have shed more than $6 trillion in value since Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement.

Further steep losses are expected when Wall Street reopens on Monday, with futures tied to the benchmark S&P500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 – which are traded outside usual market hours – down 2.7 percent and 3.55 percent, respectively.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/4/7/hong-kong-stock-market-plunges-most-since-97-crisis-amid-tariffs-panic
tariffs,Trump ‘angry’ with Putin and threatens tariffs on Russian oil over Ukraine,"United States President Donald Trump has said he is “p***** off” at his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and has threatened to impose secondary sanctions on Russian oil if Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire to end its war in Ukraine.

“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russian’s fault – which it might not be – but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said in aninterview with NBCon Sunday.

Trump said that the 25 percent tariffs could happen at any moment, adding that he plans to speak with Putin this week.

According to the report, Trump was “angry and p***** off” when the Russian president started questioning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s legitimacy and discussed the prospect of a new leadership in Ukraine.

On Thursday, Putin suggested that a temporary administration under the supervision of the United Nations should be introduced in Ukraine – a proposal swiftly rejected by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

Russian officials have repeatedly discredited Zelenskyy’s legitimacy as president, noting that no elections had been held since his term expired.







A vote has not been scheduled in Ukraine because the country’s constitution mandates that elections cannot be held undermartial law, which has been in placesince the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbouring country three years ago.

There was no immediate reaction from Moscow to Trump’s comments.

Russia has called Western sanctions “illegal” and designed for the West to take economic advantage in its rivalry with Russia.

Trump’s latest remarks followed a day of meetings and golf with Finnish President Alexander Stubb over the weekend.

Stubb’s office said he told Trump that a deadline needs to be set for establishing aRussia-Ukraine ceasefireto make it happen, and suggested April 20, since Trump would have been in office then for three months.

US officials have been separately pushing Kyiv to accept a critical minerals agreement, a summary of which suggested that the US was demanding all of Ukraine’s natural resources income for years.

Zelenskyy has saidKyiv’s lawyers needed to review the draftbefore he could say more about the offer.

Speaking on board Air Force One later on Sunday, Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of attempting to back out of the deal.

“If he does that, he’s got some problems, big, big problems,” Trump told reporters.

“He wants to be a member of NATO, but he’s never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that.”

Trump’s threat of “secondary tariffs” on Russian oil came less than a week after his administration imposed a25 percent tariffon US imports from any country buying oil or gas from Venezuela.

A similar tariff on US imports from countries that buy Russian oil could hit China and India, two of Moscow’s biggest customers, particularly hard.

In his NBC interview, Trump said Putin knows he is angry with him, but added that he had “a very good relationship with him” and “the anger dissipates quickly … if he does the right thing”.

tariffs,Trump-China trade war: Which US companies could be worst hit?,"From Apple to Nvidia, United States tech companies have received a temporaryexemptionfrom President Donald Trump’s sky-high tariffs. For other businesses, the damage imposed by existing levies on Chinese exports may prove fatal.

While Trump stepped back from the edge for most countries – announcing a 90-day pause on the bulk of his “reciprocal” tariffs onWednesday– he doubled down on China, eventually increasing import taxes on its goods to145 percent.

Trump has pitched his protectionist agenda as essential for reviving US industry. However,many US firmshave grown used to cheap imports from China. For many of them, prices will rise and profits will fall.

Beijing has also responded to Trump’s moves withretaliatory tariffs of its own, now at 125 percent. US exports to China, and agricultural products in particular, will be hit badly by China’s blanket levy.

Here is the state of trade ties between the world’s two largest economies and the US companies that could be worst affected:

Despite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trading partners.

According to data from the Office of the US Trade Representative, the total goods trade between the US and China stood at $582.4bn in 2024. After Canada and Mexico, China is America’s third largest trading partner.

US imports from China totalled $438.9bn while its exports the other way tallied in at $143.5bn. The upshot is that the US trade deficit with China was $295.4bn last year, bigger than for any other country.

On Friday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it was increasing tariffs on US goods from 84 percent to 125 percent, reiterating that Beijing would “fight to the end” shortly after Washington raised US duties on Chinese imports to 145 percent.

Late that same day, the Trump administration announced temporary exemptions for smartphones, solar panels and other electronic products like semiconductor chips – most of which are made in China – from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which he has said are meant to level the playing field with trading partners who impose duties on US goods and run trade surpluses with the US.

China’s governmentwelcomed the exemptionsand urged Trump to go further. However, the US president has said those products will ultimately be subject to their own different levy. As of now, they are still subject to the 20 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on all Chinese goods before April 2.

In the meantime, companies will be forced to pass down at least some of Trump’s tariffs onto consumers to try to preserve their profit margins. That will result in higher inflation and lower business output.

According to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, tariffs could cause 740,000 people to lose their jobs across the US by the end of 2025. But which sectors will be most exposed to these trade disruptions?

The price of Nike trainers, Levi jeans and Gap T-shirts will almost certainly rise in the US as tariffs undermine the Asian factory hubs that underpin the global clothing industry.

In 2024, factories in China, Vietnam and Indonesia made 95 percent of all Nike footwear. Trump has already introduced 145 percent tariffs on China while Vietnam and Indonesia currently face 10 percent tariffs, which could go up in July if they don’t succeed in striking a trade deal with Washington by then.

Vietnam, in particular, is seen as a major indirect source of Chinese imports, both by rerouting Chinese goods through Vietnamese ports and by using Chinese parts in its exports to the US.

Gap is also highly exposed to production processes in Vietnam. Since Trump’s “reciprocal” tariff announcement on April 2, Gap shares have fallen by 14 percent. For Nike, it’s 14.7 percent.

Elsewhere, Levi’s stock price has plunged by 10.6 percent.

On Friday night, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a notice exempting some technology products from the tariffs placed on Chinese goods.

The CBP listed 20 product categories, including computers, smartphones and automatic data processors. It also included semiconductor equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays.

The exemptions were a welcome relief to major technology firms, including Apple, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing. But even with all post-April 2 tariffs on them waived for now, these electronic goodsstill face 20 percent tariffsthat Trump had imposed on them before April 2.

Trump has also said the exemptions are temporary, and new tariffs might be coming soon. Additionally, on Monday he announced an investigation into the national security implications of importing semiconductors and chip-making equipment, injecting new insecurities for electronics firms.

Supply chains in general are hard to move. For electronic goods, they are particularly difficult to replace – lining up industrial processes across different locations requires time and investment.

Bradley Saunders, a North America analyst at Capital Economics, told Al Jazeera that technology goods assembly processes have been “built up over years. … Markets have found the most efficient supply chains that they can.”

For now, Apple outsources most of its assembly operations to China. Smartphone companies are not alone. Almost 90 percent of gaming consoles sold in the US by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have been shipped in from China.

Elsewhere, Nvidia relies heavily on components from China. The technology giant relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to manufacture its cutting-edge graphics cards and AI chips.

Apple and Nvidia led a broad advance across US stock markets after Trump announced his recent exemptions. According to Saunders, any new tariffs could hit US technology sectors “hard”.

Trump’sfirst trade war with Chinafrom 2018 to 2019 resulted in billions of dollars of lost revenue for American farmers. “The agriculture industry always tends to lose out in trade wars,” Saunders said.

He pointed out that “about 15 percent” of US farm exports went to China in 2024. Thesoya bean sector, in particular, stands to lose because China is its largest export market.

When Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in his first presidential term, Beijing retaliated by buying soya beans from other countries like Brazil. It also imposed retaliatory tariffs of its own. This time around, those tariffs are five times higher.

The American Soybean Association has publicly opposed Trump’s tariffs on China, and soya bean farmers have warned that many in the industry could go out of business if the trade war continues.

The US hasmore than 500,000 soya bean producers, according to the Department of Agriculture’s Census of Agriculture. That includes at least 223,000 full-time jobs supported by the soya bean industry, according to a 2023 report for the National Oilseed Processors Association and the United Soybean Board.

The industry is worth $124bn in the US. That’s more than the entire economy of Kenya or Bulgaria.

Corn and pig farmers have also been urging the Trump administration to step back from its tariff spat. Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Tyson Foods are three of several large US food companies that will likely lose export earnings from China.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/15/trump-china-trade-war-which-us-companies-could-be-worst-hit
tariffs,"Trump moves closer to semiconductor tariffs, floats pause on auto duties","United States President Donald Trump has advanced plans to introduce tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceutical products, even as he floated the possibility of a reprieve from his duties on the auto industry.

In the latest flurry of trade announcements on Monday, the Trump administration launched investigations into the national security implications of importing the goods and related products, including chip-making equipment and pharmaceutical ingredients.

The probes follow Trump’s remarks over the weekend that he would announce the details of new tariffs on semiconductors within days, afterhis administration exemptedthe chips and other high-tech goods from his “reciprocal” tariffs unveiled on April 2.

The investigations are the latest trade-related probes initiated by the US under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which the Trump administration has also used to scrutinise imports of copper, lumber, steel andaluminium.







Semiconductors are crucial to the manufacturing of almost all modern electronics.

The US is heavily dependent on semiconductorimports from Asia, especially Taiwan, though Trump, like his predecessor Joe Biden, has been pushing companies to make more of the chips domestically.

In an announcement that was hailed by the White House as an example of Trump’s trade policies in action, chip giant Nvidia on Monday said that it would spend up to $500bn building its artificial intelligence super computers on US soil for the first time.

Trump’s move towards new tariffs on chips and pharmaceuticals raises the prospect of fresh turmoil for businesses and financial markets around the globe, which have been roiled by the US president’s dizzying back-and-forth announcements on trade.

After announcing a90-day pauseon most of his “reciprocal” tariffs against dozens of trade partners last week, Trump raised the rate of duties on imports from China to 145 percent.

China has, in turn, slapped US imports with atariff of 125 percent, while pledging to “fight to the end” if Washington continues to escalate its trade war.

Financial markets and businesses have been waiting for signs that Trump’s tariffs will be watered down or dropped outright if the administration can extract concessions from its trading partners.

In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, Kevin Hassett, Trump’s top economic adviser, said that officials were making “astonishing” progress in their negotiations with US trading partners and had received “amazing offers” from more than 10 countries.

Hassett did not specify which countries the US was making progress with.







On Monday, Trump suggested that he could offer automakers some relief from his 25 percent tariffs on vehicles and auto parts to give them time to adjust their supply chains.

“I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies, where they’re switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico and other places, and they need a little bit of time, because they’re going tomake them here,” Trump told reporters at the White House.

“I’m a very flexible person. I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible, and you have to be,” Trump added.

US stocks, which have been on a rollercoaster ride amid Trump’s tariff announcements, rose higher on Monday, with the benchmark S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.79 percent and 0.64 percent, respectively.

tariffs,"Trump delays Canada tariffs, but anger and calls to rethink US ties persist","Montreal, Canada –Canada has experienced a tumultuous start to 2025, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeauannouncing his resignationdays into the new year, a federal election looming, and the country’s affordability crisis deepening.

Now, Canada is facingwhat some economistshave dubbed “its largest trade shock in nearly 100 years”.

United States President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25-percent tariffs on a wide range of Canadian imports and 10-percent tariffs on Canadian energy.

While the measures were set to begin on Tuesday, Trudeau said on Monday afternoon that the US tariffs and retaliatory measures announced by his government would be delayed by “at least 30 days” as the countries work together on border security.

Yet for many across the country, the potential fora trade warbetween the longtime allies continues to fuel a sense of anger, as well as anxiety and confusion over what is to come.

Trump’s threat of tariffshas also raised questions about the nature of the cross-border relationship and spurred calls for Canada to boost in-country trade while looking beyond the US for more reliable international partners.

“It’s very, very worrisome right now for workers,” Lana Payne, the national coordinator of Unifor, Canada’s largest private-sector union, told Al Jazeera before the tariff delay was announced.

“A lot of concern, a lot of worry, a lot of uncertainty — they’re feeling all of it,” she said in a phone interview on Monday.

“But I would also say… they are feeling angry right now that the United States would do this to the Canadian economy, would do this to Canadian workers, considering our long history of working together.”







The US and Canada have enjoyed close political and trade ties for decades.

Last year, the US exported more than $322bn in goods to Canada, according toUS Census data. It also imported more than $377bn worth of products from its northern neighbour.

Nearly three-quarters of Canada’s total trade exports go to the US. The country is also the US’s largest foreign energy supplier, with about 97 percent of Canadian crude oil exports going south of the border in 2023.

But Trump, who has routinely criticised Canada since he won re-election in November,has saidthe tariffs are necessary to push the Canadian government to stop fentanyl trafficking and irregular migration across its border with the US.

He has also argued that the tariffs seek to make up for a trade deficit with Canada, which he has dubbed a “subsidy”.

“We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use,” the US president recently wrote on social media.

Trudeau has hit back, announcing retaliatory tariffs against about $106bn (155 billion Canadian dollars) of US goods on Saturday. Of that, about $20bn (30 billion Canadian dollars) was set to be imposed on Tuesday.

“We will stand strong for Canada. We will stand strong to ensure our countries continue to be the best neighbours in the world,” Trudeau said.

But on Monday afternoon, the Canadian prime minister announced the proposed tariffs would be paused “for at least 30 days” after he had a “good call” with Trump.

Canada will “appoint a Fentanyl Czar, we will list cartels as terrorists, ensure 24/7 eyes on the border, launch a Canada-US Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering”, among other measures, Trudeau said.

I just had a good call with President Trump. Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan — reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly…

Asa McKercher, a professor at St Francis Xavier University who studies Canada-US relations, said the two countries have experienced tensions in the past.

He pointed to tensions over Canada’s refusal to join the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and personal animosities between former US President John F Kennedy and Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker in the early 1960s.

But McKercher said the current trade tensions have plunged the relationship to its lowest point.

“We haven’t really seen the Americans go out of their way toimpose a policythat will just destroy the Canadian economy. That is the difference here,” McKercher told Al Jazeera.

He said that since Trump signed the order authorising tariffs against Canada and Trudeau unveiled reciprocal measures, there has been an uptick in nationalist sentiment in Canada.

Canadian crowds booed the US national anthem athockey and basketball gamesover the weekend, while the leaders of several provinces have urged people to “buy Canadian” in response to the tariffs.

“Some people are reacting in the only ways they can, which is booing American hockey teams and not buying Kellogg’s cereal because it’s made in America,” he said.

For the average person, McKercher explained, those “little acts of defiance” offer “a sense of agency” in a situation where they might otherwise feel powerless.

“We’re really subject to the whims of a guy in the White House, and that’s a very scary thing.”

At a small fruit-and-vegetable shop in Montreal on Monday morning, shoppers Patricia and Lorraine were looking for an avocado — but they had to make sure it was not from the US.

“It’s creating a lot of anxiety for everyone, I think,” Patricia, who only gave Al Jazeera her first name, said of the looming tariffs. “Even the atmosphere in general: The prices will go up, it will change our pace of life.”

“We have to boycott [US products]. We have to,” Lorraine said as the pair left the shop.

“We don’t have a choice,” Patricia added.

The shop’s owner, Amine Mulhim, said he was waiting to see how the potential tariffs would affect his business. He told Al Jazeera that he already largely sells local goods, but during the winter months, a greater portion of the produce comes from the US and Mexico.

“Already, everything is expensive,” he said.

A few blocks away, at a provincial liquor store, customer Angelo Baaco was adding US wines to a small shopping cart. The Quebec governmenthad saidthat US alcohol will be taken off the shelves as of Tuesday.

“It’s just stuff that I’m not going to be able to get in the next few months, or who knows how long. So I figured, ‘OK, might as well get this,'” Baaco said, reaching for a red wine from California. “I’m going to grab another one, just in case.”

Yet the threat of a prolonged trade war goes beyond day-to-day purchases. For many Canadians — including those living in poverty and homelessness — the prospect could make analready difficult economic situationworse.

Georges Ohana — the director of homelessness prevention at the Old Brewery Mission, a support and advocacy organisation in Montreal — said his greatest concern is a potential loss of jobs as a result of the US tariffs.

“That can compound what has already been a very difficult start to the year in terms of inflation,” he told Al Jazeera.

Already, Ohana said there has been an increase in demand for food banks and shelter beds in recent years in Montreal. Rental costs in the city have also skyrocketed, making affordable housing harder to find.

“When you compound these different systems, it makes it more difficult for homeless men and women, people that are vulnerable, people that have trauma, to be able to get the necessary help they need,” he said.

But, Ohana added, “I don’t think we should jump to conclusions [on tariffs]. I think we should wait to see how this fares out.”

Even as Canada appears to have secured a reprieve from US tariffs — at least for now — many Canadians have expressed anger at Trump’s repeated threats against their country.

Last week, political, labour and civil society leadersreleasedthe “Pledge for Canada” to build a nationwide response to the Trump administration’s policies.

That includes protecting Canadian sovereignty, reducing the country’s “dependence on the United States by diversifying our trade”, and building alliances with other countries, including on climate action, humanitarian aid and advancing democracy.

“It’s becoming very clear that to build resiliency for Canada in this increasingly turbulent world, it means actually lessening our dependency on our southern neighbour,” lawmaker Charlie Angus of the New Democratic Party said during anews conferenceannouncing the campaign.

According to Payne at Unifor, a threat of tariffs — which Canada has experienced for weeks, since Trump first made his plan known in November — remains dangerous on its own.

“It causes industry to pause on investments. It causes industry to divert investment to the United States. It causes industry to cancel investments because tariffs make it more expensive for them to operate,” she explained.

But she said Trump’s tariff threat also has created an understanding in Canada that the country must review all of its economic and trade policies, including procurement processes, infrastructure projects and natural resource development.

“All of that is on the table in a way that it has not been on the table in a very long time,” she told Al Jazeera.

“There is a great appetite for this right now because there is a sense … that we no longer have a friend the way that we thought that we did, and a stable trading partner,” Payne added.

“We have a president that rips up trade agreements. We have a president that threatens us daily with measures that would throw our economy into a recession. These are not the actions of an ally.”

tariffs,‘I don’t have the cash to pay for these tariffs’: US small biz suffers,"After working in the outdoor industry for three years at Smith, which makes helmets and goggles, Cassie Abel realised there were not many brands built exclusively with women in mind. In 2016, she founded Wild Rye, a rural Idaho-based outdoor apparel brand for women.

Building her business was a labour of passion and included big risks, such as leveraging her house for capital. It was not until 2021 that she became profitable. Now, her business faces yet another existential threat: High tariffs will drive up her costs, and she’s unsure how long she can keep her business alive.

Abel is expecting $700,000 worth of purchase orders arriving in July, which encompasses the brand’s full fall lineup, which she ordered in December from suppliers in China. She says Wild Rye, which imports twice a year, will now be subject to $1.2m in tariffs for its upcoming shipment.

“I don’t have the cash to pay for these tariffs. These tariffs are due upon entering the country. I won’t have time to sell this product before the tariffs are done. We could be out of business in the next four months,” Abel said.

Since taking office, United States President Donald Trumphas imposed a 145-percent tariffon China and 10 percent on all other countries. The president has claimed the tariffs incentivise businesses to bring manufacturing back stateside. But that has left hundreds of small businesses like Abel’s scrambling to find ways to manage the hefty fee.





US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a group of reporters at a White House briefing last week, “The goal here is to bring back the high-quality industrial jobs to the US. President Trump is interested in the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past. You know, we don’t need to necessarily have a booming textile industry like where I grew up again, but we do want to have precision manufacturing and bring that back.”

His comments put additional pressure on employers like Wild Rye. To weather the storm caused by the Trump administration’s tariffs, Abel has frozen hiring, paused salary increases for her 11 full-time employees, and stalled new product development. She said she will need to raise prices on her products for the fall, ranging from 10 to 20 percent.

On April 29, she and hundreds of members of the outdoor apparel community met leaders in Washington to push for assistance. Abel said Democrats were unsure what they could do amid Republican control of the House of Representatives and Senate, while Republican leadership feared retribution if they went against the president.

“I was hearing it [concern] from both sides of the aisle. There’s frustration, it’s like it’s hard to find a path forward. Everyone understands that small businesses are going to crumble, and everyone feels like there’s no playbook for this,” Abel told Al Jazeera.

The US Chamber of Commerce has also pushed the White House to carve out exceptions for small businesses like Wild Rye, which the Trump administration quickly dismissed.

Abel says she started as a made-in-USA brand, but that was not financially sustainable.

“That almost tanked the business before we launched because the US simply doesn’t have the capability or capacity to produce technical apparel,” Abel said.

Most textile products like clothes and shoes that Americans buy are not made in the US. The US imports about 97 percent of clothes, mostly from Asian countries including China, which has been hit hard by the 145-percent tariffs, but also from Vietnam and Bangladesh.

But it’s not just the apparel industry facing this challenge. It’s the entire small business community – defined as a business with 500 employees or less – a portion of the economy that employs roughly 61.7 million Americans, representing 45.9 percent of the US workforce and accounts for 43.5 percent of the US gross domestic product (GDP).







Thebroader economy has also alreadyfelt shockwaves from the tariffs that will impact small businesses. The US GDP fell in the first quarter, per the US Commerce Department, by 0.3 percent after a 2.4 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2024. According to ADP, job growth stumbled to 62,000—a more immediate metric than the US Labor Department’s jobs report, which lags by a month and shows 177,000 jobs added.

Consumer confidence hit a 13-year low, and consumers are pulling back spending amid fears of further rising costs — which, in turn, means fewer people could buy products ranging from outdoor apparel to single-origin teas and spices.

In 2014, Chitra Agrawal founded Brooklyn Delhi, an Indian cuisine-inspired food brand in Brooklyn, New York, with her husband Ben Garthus.

Over the last decade, they have created a range of products, including 14 different condiments and simmer sauces, that started as handmade and have since grown into a large-scale business distributing to major retailers like Whole Foods and Kroger, as well as meal kit services like HelloFresh and Blue Apron.

Because hers is a specialty brand, sourcing certain ingredients from other parts of the world is not just part of the brand’s allure, it is also a necessity.

“We are making these authentic Indian products that require ingredients that are just not grown or available at scale in the US. It kind of puts us in a tough place,” Agrawal told Al Jazeera.

Agrawal said 65 percent to 70 percent of the ingredients she uses come from outside of the US, primarily from India, and a handful from Mexico and Sri Lanka, as well as glass from China.

Like Agrawal, Anjali Bhargava faces a similar challenge. The founder of Anjali’s Cup, a brand that makes single-origin spices and teas from around the world, sources ginger from Vietnam, turmeric from Thailand, and tea from India, ingredients that, in her view, make the brand so special.

In 2024, the United States was the largest importer of both ginger and several different varieties of tea, including black and green, according to Tridge, a global food sourcing data analytics firm.

“I am going to have to pay the tariffs on those things if it comes down to it, if I want to continue making those products. [Not being able to make these products] is not negotiable for me,” Bhargava said.

She says that in order to cut costs, she is trying to find domestic alternatives for aspects of her production, like packaging, a big expense. Pre-tariffs, she imported tins from China. Once her stock runs out, she may have to discontinue four to six of the 11 products she offers because she cannot afford the extra cost for imports.

“Basically, to keep the business moving, I’m being forced to undertake a complete overhaul of my retail packaging [which can be produced stateside], which means redesigning, re-photographing, and that comes with a cost,” Bhargava added.

She says she will need to move away from tins, which she imports from China and explore other kinds of packaging options like pouches. The unexpected one-time costs of $10,000 to $20,000 will eat into her already slim margins, Bhargava says. She is the only full-time employee, but hires freelancers and outsources to other businesses for tasks ranging from packaging to delivery.

Unlike larger companies, it’s much harder for small businesses to absorb the tariffs.

“We’ve seen that it’s hard for small businesses to balance those costs as they have very small margins. They are the ones who are going to get hit hardest,” said Alexis D’Amato, director of government affairs for Small Business Majority, an advocacy group for small businesses.

“They’re bracing for impact on how they’re going to either eat these costs or pass them on to the consumer, which nobody wants to do,” D’Amato added.

Raising prices in response to market pressures does not guarantee they will fall when costs decline. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions forced producers to increase prices. But even after costs eased, grocers kept prices high because consumers continued paying them — and no policy or market force compelled reductions.

That burden weighs on Agrawal.

“Once you make that change and say at one point, I want to roll back those price increases, there’s no guarantee that on the shelf, the prices will decrease. It’s very difficult when you’re working with grocery stores to get your prices to be lowered again. We have to really be very careful about this move. We’re still contemplating it,” said Brooklyn Delhi’s Agrawal.

But these looming concerns have led consumers and businesses to import goods before tariffs kick in, to stock up on key items that may help them avoid raising prices, at least for some time.

In the first quarter, US imports surged by 41.3 percent, including by entrepreneurs like Sean Mackowski, owner of Tallon Electric, a company that makes guitar pedals in Columbus, Ohio.

“We did stock up a lot. I think everybody did their best to scramble, hoping that that will bridge the gap to this going away. But if we get to the end of that bridge, we’ll either need to find a different way or we’re going to start running out of stuff,” Mackowski told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/9/i-dont-have-the-cash-to-pay-for-these-tariffs-us-small-biz-suffers
tariffs,"Fact-check: Donald Trump’s latest claims on tariffs, murders and more","In a December 8 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, United States President-elect Donald Trump elaborated on plans for removing people illegally residing in the country and imposing tariffs on trade partners – and made some false claims to support them.

Trump reiterated his promise to end the granting of birthright citizenship, meaning citizenship given to anyone born on US soil. Although he said he would like to do this on his first day as president, he acknowledged that he might have to go “back to the people” through a constitutional amendment.

On his plans to carry out mass deportations, Trump said he would start with people convicted of crimes and try to find a way to allow “Dreamers” – people brought to the US illegally as minors – to remain. This group is called “Dreamers” because of the DREAM Act, a set of never-passed proposals in Congress.

Trump said members of the House committee that investigated the events preceding the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, “committed a major crime … honestly, they should go to jail”. When host Kristen Welker asked Trump whether he would pardon the people convicted of January 6-related crimes, he said, “We’re looking at it right now. Most likely, yeah.”

Here are some of the things Trump said in his interview, fact-checked.

Tariffs“cost Americans nothing”.

This isFalse.

The Trump transition team pointed to reports by the Coalition for a Prosperous America, an often-pro-tariff group advocating for “strategic trade, tax and growth policies”. But the vast majority of credentialed economists dispute the argument that tariffs are a net positive. In surveys in 1990, 2000, 2011 and 2021, about 95 percent of American Economic Association members agreed that tariffs reduced “general economic welfare”.

Most economists say that consumers in the tariff-levying country lose in these deals, paying higher prices directly for foreign goods and indirectly because of higher prices for foreign-sourced raw materials used in domestic goods. Also, if the other country retaliates by raising tariffs on US goods, sales can decline for US producers.

If fully applied, the North American tariffs could raise grocery prices, given thatMexicoaccounted for 69 percent of US vegetable imports and 51 percent of fresh fruit imports in 2022. New tariffs onCanadacould also raise gasoline prices, especially in the upper Midwest, which relies on Canadian crude oil imports. Construction prices couldrise, too; one-quarter of the lumber used in the US comes from Canada, and both Canada and Mexico supply cement, metals, machinery and other homebuilding necessities.

“Tariffs artificially raise the cost of doing business, which depresses overall economic production in the form of lower gross domestic product, artificially higher prices, and fewer goods sold,” Boise State University political scientist Ross Burkhart, who studies trade policy, told PolitiFact. “For the consumer, this means a reduction in purchasing power.”

“When I handed it over (to Biden) they didn’t have inflation for a year and a half … Then they created inflation with energy and with spending too much.”

This isexaggeratedon both counts.

Inflation was about 1 percent late in Trump’s term, mainly because COVID-19 had drastically slowed many types of economic activity.

However, the rise in inflation under President Joe Biden began sooner than Trump said. During the Biden presidency’s first six months, many Americans received COVID-19 vaccines, and the economy began to re-emerge, stoking consumer demand as supplies lagged. Year-over-year inflation hit 4.9 percent by May 2021, four months into Biden’s term, which marked its highest level in about 13 years. From there, inflation kept rising, peaking at about 9 percent a year and a half into Biden’s term.

Economists say excessive spending by Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act exacerbated inflation, but the root cause was mostly COVID-19-era supply chain shortages and global energy market disruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.







The US let in 13,099 murderers “within the three-year period. It’s during the Biden term.”

False.

In a letter released in September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a federal agency, said there are 13,099 noncitizens convicted of homicide who are not in immigration detention.

However, this data refers to people who entered the country over the past 40 years, including under Trump – which Welker pointed out. There is no evidence that all 13,099 people entered in a single three-year period under Biden.

Also, many people included in this number are not in immigration detention because they’re serving prison sentences.

The US is “the only country that has” birthright citizenship.

More than 30 other nations do.

World Population Review lists 33 nations that grant citizenship to anyone born within their borders. The US is joined by Mexico and many countries in Central and South America including Brazil and Argentina. The US and Canada are the only two “developed” countries, as defined by the International Monetary Fund, that have unrestricted birthright citizenship laws.

Trump also said, “You know, if somebody sets a foot, just a foot, one foot, you don’t need two, on land, congratulations, you are now a citizen of the United States of America.”

That is not true. Setting one foot on US soil doesn’t make a migrant a citizen; if it did, then there would be no such thing as illegal immigration.

“Obamacare is lousy healthcare.”

Most people who use it don’t feel that way.

A 2023 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare policy research group, found strong satisfaction with plans purchased on the marketplaces for the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare.

Among respondents who had insurance purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, 20 percent called their care “excellent” and another 52 percent called it “good”. A further 23 percent called it “fair” and 5 percent called it “poor”.

This was just a few percentage points behind approval ratings among people who had employer-sponsored insurance. Of that group, 33 percent said their plan was “excellent” and 47 percent said their plan was “good”.

“Crime is at an all-time high.”

This is far off base.

The violent crime rate, as measured by the FBI, is about half as high as it was in the early 1990s.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/9/fact-check-donald-trumps-latest-claims-on-tariffs-murders-and-more
tariffs,"Global trade war escalates as US tariffs on steel, aluminum imports launch","Tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the United States have come into effect, intensifying the global trade war sparked by President Donald Trump.

Trump’stariffs on metals imports took effect on Wednesday, levying a 25 percent duty “with no exceptions or exemptions”. Trading partners were quick to express objections, with some swiftly announcing retaliation.

The tariffs came into play as exemptions, duty-free quotas and product exclusions expired. In addition, the duty on aluminium was raised from 10 percent.

Separate tariffs have been levied on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea also by charging “reciprocal” rates starting on April 2.

Trump has claimed that the taxes will help the US metals sector and create jobs. However, his seesawing tariff threats are jolting markets, raising fears of an economic slowdown, and threatening to raise prices for consumers.







The European Commission responded almost immediately as the tariffs came into play, announcing counter duties on 26 billion euros ($28bn) worth of US goods starting next month.

“This matches the economic scope of the US tariffs,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a statement, adding that the regime would be imposed in two steps and be fully implemented by April 13.

The head of the EU executive also reiterated the bloc’s belief that Trump’s push to overturn global trade norms is damaging to Western unity in the face of rising challenges.

“We will always remain open to negotiation,” she said. “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.”

Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminium to the US, said it is considering reciprocal actions.

British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said “all options were on the table” to respond in the national interest.

In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese denounced the move as “entirely unjustified … and against the spirit of our two nations’ enduring friendship” but ruled out tit-for-tat duties.

Meanwhile, two leading South Korean steelmakers announced they were considering investing in new facilities in the US, supporting Trump’s claim that his tariffs are encouraging foreign investment in the country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/12/global-trade-war-intensifies-as-us-tariffs-on-metals-imports-take-effect
tariffs,Trump’s tariffs may end up blowing up the US dollar hegemony,"United States President Donald Trump’s second term in office has launched with a whirlwind of changes to the status quo in Washington, DC, and to US relations with the world.

The rapid pace of departures from the norm – from targeting Canada, the US’s most steadfast ally, with larger tariffs than China, and floating the US occupation of Gaza, to the threat to annex Greenland and the decision to reach out to Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to end the war in Ukraine – is overwhelming, and intentionally so.









Trump’s tariffs may not be the most shocking foreign policy overture of his second administration, but they may well end up being the most consequential in the long run.

Like all his headline-generating foreign policy moves, his plan for tariffs is also part of his overreaching game plan to reshape the US economy. He says he will be imposing tariffs on Europe, China and everyone else that trades with the US to bring manufacturing back home, and “Make America Great Again”.

But in this instance, Trump’s boldness is unlikely to bring him closer to his long-term goals due to the inadvertent impact these tariffs will eventually have on the US dollar.

Manufacturing costs in the US are far higher than they are even in Europe, let alone Asia, and thus the immediate effect of his tariffs and threats of tariffs would inevitably be to raise inflation expectations as well as begin a new cycle of US dollar strength versus other leading currencies. While it may seem that a stronger dollar would weaken inflation, tariffs and the threat thereof add additional costs to trade, which minimise this potential benefit. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve has paused its rate-cutting cycle even as other top central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, push ahead with their cuts, as their fears of renewed inflation have been supplanted by the need to stimulate growth in the face of trade threats.

The structure of the international monetary system in which the US dollar already dominates, however, means that higher yield expectations for US assets will only further strengthen the dollar.

For so long, global demand for the US currency has meant that its primary export has been its currency and related financial products. This unique “exorbitant privilege” is what has enabled Washington to run both trade and fiscal deficits without any major drag on the economy.

Trump has increasingly realised the importance of protecting this system, threatening 100 percent tariffs and other action against countries that seek to de-dollarise and embrace the Russia and China-backed “BRICS” organisation.

Trump today sees his task as not just one of reordering fiscal policy to support US domestic manufacturing, but one of establishing new rules of the international monetary order as well. Put simply, the president wants to ensure that the US dollar can trade at a weaker value compared with other currencies while not undermining the centrality of the currency – and in particular US government securities – in the international monetary system.

This has led to a discussion of whether the Trump administration is aiming to reach new dollar stabilisation deals with other governments and their central banks akin to those the Reagan administration made in the 1980s, known as the Plaza Accord and the Louvre Accord. Indeed, that the Trump administration is trying to reach a so-called “Mar-a-Lago” accord has become a frequent talking point amongst economists.

Yet such a move will be extremely difficult because, in contrast to the Reagan-era dollar stabilisation accords, where the focus was on Japan, today any such accord would have to focus on China. Back then, the US saw the perceived weakness of the Japanese yen as a threat to its interests and acted to correct it. This was not a big challenge as Tokyo was – and still is – a close US ally. China, however, is nothing of the sort. It is far less interested in any such negotiations, and the legacy of those 1980s’ deals – in Japan, the strengthening of the yen as a result of those accords is more often than not seen as a core factor in the country’s subsequent “lost decades” – is frequently cited by Beijing as an example of why strengthening its currency against the dollar would carry significant risks.

Trump is willing to weaponise this system to secure concessions and achieve its long-term goals, even when they have nothing to do with trade. Even the most steadfast US allies must prepare for threats that go far beyond tariffs. This was foreshadowed in his late January threat of “treasury, banking and financial sanctions” against Colombia if it did not accept military aircraft delivering deportees – moves typically reserved for rogue states like North Korea, Iran, and Russia.

Such threats portend far more economic devastation than tariffs precisely because of the US dollar, its government securities, and the wider financial system’s centrality to the global economy.

Yet the Trump administration’s willingness to use such threats against allies means that it has little hope of entering any negotiations with China with its allies supporting it economically. Beijing and other supporters of eroding the dollar system will seek to exploit these weaknesses. For example, for Putin this is an even more important goal than weakening NATO – he has mentioned the dollar system nearly one and a half times as frequently as he has mentioned the military alliance since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Trump is trying to reorder the international monetary system to the US benefit, but so far his actions signal that his understanding of it is sophomoric at best. Never was this more evident than when asked about NATO spending levels in Spain shortly after his inauguration, he mislabelled the country as a member of the BRICS bloc.

The US dollar system has never been entirely an American one. It was in large part birthed in Europe, where banks began to issue loans in dollars in the 1950s to meet regional financing needs and demand. As such, by upending the foreign policy unity between the US and Europe supposedly to “Make America Great Again”, Trump may end up inadvertently upending the dollar system that has been responsible for much of America’s power and greatness for decades.

The major difference between those countries that are members of the BRICS bloc and European states like Spain is that BRICS members are almost all massive earners of international trade surpluses, exporting more than they import, while they also almost always maintain significant capital controls.

Europe’s trade strength, on the other hand, is not enough to sustain levels of government expenditure in most of the European Union or the United Kingdom. Nor is it in Japan, whose debt-to-GDP figure is well in excess of any other leading economy. In turn, after the US, these historic allies are the main borrowers on international capital markets, while capital from the surplus-earning nations, such as many BRICS members, are those who seek to invest in them. This is why China is the number one holder of US treasuries despite the Washington-Beijing geopolitical rivalry.

Trump’s moves – such as tariffs and annexation threats directed at allies – tend to undermine this system. His geopolitical threats that aim to reorder the monetary system may be targeted at Beijing, but his approach risks not just breaking the political alignment between the US and its historic allies, but also their economic alliance.

Were Trump to be successful in his approach, it likely would have some benefits for US manufacturing. Growth from manufacturing’s current 10.2 percent of US gross domestic product would certainly appeal to his base. But the risk is that in aiming to do so, he blows up the US dollar system. And that would be devastating for the US economy, likely triggering not only major inflation but also a dramatic recession.

tariffs,"EU agrees tariffs on Russian, Belarusian grain imports from July","European Union trade ministers have agreed to impose prohibitive tariffs on grain and other agricultural products from Russia and Belarus from July 1.

The tariffs will be 95 euros ($102.76) per tonne for cereals and 50 percent of their value for oilseeds. Tariffs will also apply to beet-pulp pellets and dried peas. The ministers’ decision on Thursday follows a proposal from the European Commission on March 22.

The announcement of the new tariffs quickly drew Russian disapproval.

“The new messages from the EU will yet have to be analysed, but their ideology is clear – they want to squeeze Russia out of everything,” Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters at a weekly briefing.

Vincent Van Peteghem, the finance minister of Belgium, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, said the new tariffs were intended to stop imports of grain from Russia and Belarus into the EU “in practice”.

“These measures will, therefore, prevent the destabilisation of the EU’s grain market, halt Russian exports of illegally appropriated grain produced in the territories of Ukraine and prevent Russia from using revenues from exports to the EU to fund its war of aggression against Ukraine,” he said.

The EU’s grain imports from Moscow have risen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Figures from the Eurostat statistics office show imports grew from under 120 million euros ($130m) in 2020 to 290 million euros ($314m) in 2021 and 440 million euros ($477m) in 2023.

Last year, Russia exported 4.2 million tonnes of cereals and related agricultural products to the EU worth 1.3 billion euros ($1.4bn). This represented about 1 percent of the EU market.

The commission has said there was a risk that imports could increase, given Russian overall wheat exports had risen to 50 million tonnes from the usual 35 million tonnes.

EU ministers said the increase in customs duties would not harm global food security because it would not affect the transit of the products through EU territory to third countries.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/30/eu-agrees-tariffs-on-russian-belarusian-grain-imports-from-july
tariffs,Five key takeaways from Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ reciprocal tariffs,"President Donald Trump has announceda series of sweeping tariffsagainst trade partners, describing April 2 as “Liberation Day” and arguing that the punitive steps would bring industry and jobs back to the United States by fighting against what he claims are unfair duties imposed by others on US goods.

Trump’s latest tariffs, announced on Wednesday, coupled with a series of similar moves since he returned to office on January 20, mark the most dramatic escalation in US tariffs in almost a century.









Several nations have said they would retaliate, raising the risk of a global trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs.

Here are the key takeaways from the latest round of US tariff announcements:

Trump has, in effect, blown up the global trading system that has stood for more than 75 years and that was based on the premise that encouraging free trade was ultimately advantageous to all nations.

The Trump administration slapped a new 10 percent baseline tariff on imports from every country, even those that impose lower tariffs on US products. And for the countries the administration accuses of actively blocking US goods, the penalties go even further – with steeper, retaliatory tariffs.

“We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us, so the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal,” Trump said on Wednesday afternoon. “I could have done that, I guess, but it would have been tough for a lot of countries, and we didn’t want to do that.”

Instead of matching the European Union’s 39 percent tariff on US goods, for instance, the US will impose a 20 percent duty, he said. For China, which already faces a 20 percent tariff, there will be an additional 34 percent levy, bringing the total to 54 percent.

The administration has used its own calculations to assert that other countries impose much higher tariffs on the US.

In general, US tariffs are lower than those of many other countries. According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the average US tariff, weighted by the goods actually traded, is just 2.2 percent. In comparison, the EU averages 2.7 percent, China 3 percent, and India much higher at 12 percent.

These WTO figures do not account for recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration or the duties under free trade agreements, such as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

Invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, Trump announced a 10 percent tariff on all countries, scheduled to take effect on Saturday, April 5.

The countries facing only a 10 percent tariff include:

About 60 countries will face individualised tariffs, calculated to be roughly half of the tariffs and other barriers that the Trump administration claims they charge the US.

The key trading partners subject to these customised tariff rates include:

The new tariffs come into effect from 00:01am ET (04:01GMT) on April 9.

The reciprocal tariffs will not apply to specific goods such as copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, gold, energy, and “certain minerals that are not available in the United States”, according to a White House fact sheet.

It would also impose a 25 percent tariff on all foreign-made automobiles. These tariffs are set to take effect at midnight on Thursday, April 3.

Multiple countries have indicated they would retaliate.

“China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,” the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Wednesday.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU is also preparing further countermeasures. “We are already finalising the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel,” she said, referring to Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium that went into effect last month.

Japan said it was leaving all options open to respond to the “extremely regrettable” duties.

Volkswagen announced it would implement an “import fee” on vehicles affected by the 25 percent tariff, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.

The German automaker has temporarily halted rail shipments of vehicles from Mexico and will hold at port cars arriving by ship from Europe, the report said, citing a memo to retailers.

However, Nick Marro, the principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said few Asian countries would be willing to take on Trump and risk further retaliation.

“China is likely going to release some type of retaliation against the US … while Japan has said it will also consider some type of retaliatory duties, we expect US agriculture to be mainly in the crosshairs there,” Marro told Al Jazeera.

“That said, a lot of other Asian markets aren’t really in a position to retaliate,” he said.

“Places like Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, they have been hit with higher tariffs, but the size of their economy, their dependence on external trade, and the importance of the US as a source of final demand will really constrain their ability to adopt a hawkish attitude here.”

Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, described Trump’s announcement as “complicated”, and said manufacturers are trying to determine the implications for their operations.

“The stakes for manufacturers could not be higher. Many manufacturers in the United States already operate with thin margins. The high costs of new tariffs threaten investment, jobs, supply chains and, in turn, America’s ability to outcompete other nations and lead as the pre-eminent manufacturing superpower,” Timmons said in a statement.

Michelle Korsmo, president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, said restaurant owners are concerned that tariffs will push up costs and lead to higher prices for customers.

“Restaurant operators know consumers are very sensitive to costs and have kept menu price increases to 30 percent, while their food costs have gone up 40 percent in the last five years,” Korsmo said in a statement.

Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, offered a more positive assessment, saying the tariffs put US manufacturers and workers first.

“These hardworking men and women have seen unfair trade cut the ground from beneath their feet for decades. They deserve a fighting chance,” Paul said in a statement.

tariffs,Trump blames predecessor as US economy hit by tariff policies,"United States President Donald Trump blames former president Joe Biden for the decline of key economic indicators during his first months as president, amid widespread disruptions caused by Trump’stariff policies.

TheUS economycontracted by 0.3 percent during the first quarter of the year, the first such drop in three years. During the last three months of 2024, the economy grew by 2.4 percent.

“This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” Trump said in a post on his website Truth Social. “Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang.’ This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!”







Sincetaking office, Trump’s efforts to upend the global trade system through a series of aggressive import duties have caused turmoil in financial markets amid fears of an escalating trade war and uncertainty surrounding the tariff policies.

The first quarter saw an uptick in imports, as US businesses seek to get out ahead of higher costs that could accompany future tariffs. Inflation, however, continues to ease. In March, consumer prices were 2.3 percent higher than they were a year earlier, compared with 2.5 percent in February.

In a press release from the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt mirrored Trump’s claims that Biden was to blame for any turbulence while also stating that the Wednesday economic report showed “strong economic momentum”.

“It’s no surprise the leftovers of Biden’s economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth, but the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,” Leavitt said.

Many economic analysts blame Trump’s chaotic approach to tariffs for the US’s flagging indicators. Since taking office, the S&P 500 has shrunk by about 7.3 percent.







“If the blowout on trade was the result of firms pre-buying imported inputs to beat the tariffs, the decay in the trade balance will reverse in second quarter,” Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told the news agency Reuters. “That will generate some GDP growth. However, corrosive uncertainty and higher taxes, tariffs are a tax on imports, will drag GDP growth back into the red by the end of this year.”

In recent weeks, the White House has suggested that it could draw down tariffs with key US trading partnerssuch as China, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stating last week that current rates were not “sustainable”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/30/trump-blames-predecessor-as-us-economy-hit-by-tariff-policies
tariffs,China retaliates with tariffs on US goods after Trump’s move,"China willimpose tariffsof 15 percent on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States in retaliation for Washington’s 10 percent levies on Chinese goods.

China’s Ministry of Finance also announced on Tuesday that there would be 10 percent tariffs on imports from the US of crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement vehicles and pick-up trucks.

The new measures were in response to the “unilateral tariff hike” by the US, it said, adding that Washington’s decision “seriously violates World Trade Organization rules, does nothing to resolve its own problems, and disrupts normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States”.

Beijing’s tariffs, which come into force on February 10, were announced shortly after US President Donald Trump said he would hold a call with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in the next 24 hours.







On Saturday, Trump announced sweeping measures against its top trade partners, including Canada and Mexico, with goods from China facing an additional 10 percent tariff on top of the duties they already endure.

Trump said the measures aimed to punish countries for failing to halt flows of undocumented migrants and drugs, including fentanyl, into the US.

However, on Monday, he suspended his threat of tariffs on Mexico and Canada, agreeing to a 30-day pause in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement with the neighbouring countries.

“China’s retaliatory tariffs are a calibrated response rather than an outright escalation,” Julien Chaisse, professor at City University of Hong Kong specialising in international economic law, said.

“The measures demonstrate Beijing’s willingness to impose economic costs on Washington while maintaining flexibility for negotiation.

“The choice of a February 10 start date appears strategic. It allows time for a possible discussion between Trump and Xi which is creating space for last-minute diplomacy before the measures take effect. If talks between the two take place in the coming days, there is room for adjustments, partial exemptions or reciprocal gestures that could prevent a further spiral in trade tensions.

“That said, much will depend on Washington’s interpretation of these measures. If the US views them as a calibrated step leaving room for negotiation, this could set the stage for discussions rather than further escalation. However, if Trump sees this as a direct challenge, his administration could respond with additional trade restrictions. This would intensify the conflict.”







During his first term in 2018, Trump initiated a brutal two-year trade war with China over its massive US trade surplus, with tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods upending global supply chains and damaging the world economy.

To end that trade war, China agreed in 2020 to spend an extra $200bn a year on US goods, but the plan was derailed by the COVID pandemic and its annual trade deficit widened to $361bn, according to Chinese customs data released last month.

Trump warned he might increase tariffs on China further unless Beijing stemmed the flow of fentanyl, a deadly opioid, into the US.

China has called fentanyl a US problem and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/4/china-retaliates-with-tariffs-on-us-goods-after-trumps-move
tariffs,Could Canada really stop oil flow to the US in response to Trump tariffs?,"A major trade war between the United States and Canada has been averted after US President Donald Trump agreed to hold off on imposing a 25 percenttariff for 30 days. Butanger has erupted in Canada, with people calling for a boycott of US products, and some even calling to stop the export of oil to the country’s southern neighbour.

However, blocking crude oil flow to the US could inflict an enormous economic cost on Canada, which pumps nearly all of its crude oil to the US via a network of pipelines.

Moreover, it would take some time for Canada to diversify its exports after decades of close trade ties cemented by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trumprenegotiatedduring his first term in office from 2017 to 2021.

Hence, in theory, Canada could stop the flow of oil into the US as leverage to get Trump to back down on the tariff threats. But doing so would disrupt crude supply to refineries in Canada’s east as the pipelines pass through the US territory.

The main caveat is how Canada’s pipeline infrastructure is laid. It begins in western Canada, where most of the oil is produced, but has to pass through the US to reach the eastern side of Canada.

Most of the oil is produced in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), which comprises the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

The crude oil is carried through pipelines passing through the US to reach Canada’s east coast provinces, including Ontario and Quebec, where it is refined. So the network of pipelines, some of which were constructed in the 1950s, serve both the refineries in the US and Canada.

“Canada and the US made a conscious decision to integrate their energy infrastructure,” Gitane De Silva, former CEO of government agency Canada Energy Regulator (CER), told Al Jazeera. “It’s been that way for a really long time.”

In 1994, the US, Canada and Mexico signed the NAFTA deal, which removed most tariffs between the three countries and included provisions on energy cooperation.

“When the agreement was ratified, there was a desire in the US for Canada to export as much energy as possible,” De Silva said. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA under Trump in 2020, maintains most of NAFTA’s provisions regarding energy.

Geography also plays a role in how the pipelines are built.

“The geology and geography to build pipelines from Alberta to Ontario and Quebec is a bit challenging because of the continental shield and the Great Lakes,” De Silva said. The continental shield is a zone of really old and hard Precambrian rock that makes up nearly half of Canada’s land mass.

Canadian oil flows to parts of the US, such as the Midwest, where some of the refineries are located. Some of the refineries in the US are closer to the Canadian oil sites than eastern provinces. For example, the oil region of British Columbia is closer to California in the US than to the Canadian province of Ontario.



Almost all of Canada’s crude oil exports – about 97 percent – were exported to the US in 2023, according to CER.

In 2022, 60 percent of US oil imports were from Canada, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

In 2024, Canada produced 5.7 million barrels of oil per day, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. About 4.3 million barrels of petroleum products were exported to the US per day.

Theoretically yes, but it is unlikely, experts say.

The federal government does, in theory, have the authority to stop the exports. But De Silva said that would be complicated, as Canada is a confederation, which means the federal government and provinces share power. Oil production comes under provincial power.

“There are definitely legal questions there, because Canada’s never done it before,” De Silva told Al Jazeera, adding that disagreements could cause a “domestic constitutional crisis”.

De Silva added that there is also the question of where the oil would be stored after turning off the tap. “When pipelines are full, it will be very hard to find space for an additional 4 million barrels a day.”

De Silva added that if Canada’s government decides to cut off the oil supply to the US, there would also be a question mark over how the eastern parts of Canada – Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick – would get their oil. It raises questions about whether the US would in turn prevent the flow of oil, which flows through US territory, to eastern Canada.

According to the 1977 US-Canada transit pipelines agreement, no public authority in the US or Canada shall institute measures “which are intended to, or which would have the effect of, impeding, diverting, redirecting or interfering with in any way the transmission of hydrocarbon in transit”.

While breaches of the treaty can be challenged in court, “with the Trump administration, I don’t know if they are that focused on those international treaties”, De Silva said.

Last month, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said “We don’t need their [Canada’s] oil and gas. We have more than anybody.” He has vowed to drill more oil to compensate for a potential Canadian oil stoppage.

There are alternative ways through which the crude oil can be transported from the west of Canada to the east, including through rail, truck, marine and tanker. However, said De Silva, “pipelines are the safest way to transport oil and gas. They are also the most efficient and most cost-effective, so it would not be a complete solution, it would not be an ideal solution, but it would be an option, if needed.”

According to 2024data from CER, pipelines exported 89.6 percent of Canada’s crude oil. The rest was sent by rail and other networks.

“Canada has been actively looking for other export markets for its oil,” De Silva said. However, there is no overnight solution for this, she added.

Even during the previous administration of US President Joe Biden, concerns were raised about the need for Canada to reform its pipeline strategy. On his first day in office, Biden cancelled the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline from Canada to the US over climate change concerns.

“It is time for Canada to review its strategy because we see that now, with the new administration, it can become very dangerous for us to only have one client for our exports,” economist Miguel Ouellette wrote in a report published in 2021 by the Montreal Economic Institute (MEI).

Canadian pipeline operator Trans Mountain said that if Trump does implement tariffs, deliveries to Asia are likely to increase, Reuters reported on Tuesday. A pipeline was expanded last year to bring oil to Canada’s Pacific coast from where oil is shipped on tankers to China, Japan and South Korea.

De Silva explained that banning oil exports to the US would also have a very negative impact on Canada’s own economy. “The oil sector is the largest driver of our economy,” she said. “Given that the US is our largest export market, I think the federal government would think very, very carefully before choosing to do that because the domestic impacts would be almost as considerable or as considerable as the impacts on the US.”

In 2022, 79.2 percent of Canada’s refined oil came from the US, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC).

The US imports Canadian crude oil, which is refined in the Midwest of the US, and then sold back to Canada and the rest of the world.

De Silva said that one of the arguments Canada is making to prevent the US from issuing tariffs is that “Canada exports affordable, reliable, secure energy produced with high environmental standards and commitment to human rights, [and] sells that to the US at a discount. Then, the US refiners buy that, refine it and send it back to Canada and the rest of the world at a considerable cost markup.”

The higher tariffs could make fuel expensive, pushing up inflation. They could also impact export-oriented sectors, leading to job losses – which would negatively impact Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party, facing an election later this year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/5/could-canada-really-stop-oil-flow-to-the-us-in-response-to-trump-tariffs
tariffs,"Is Donald Trump keeping his promises on immigration, tariffs and DOGE?","When President Donald Trump addresses the United States Congress on Tuesday, he will describe a rapid-fire effort to deliver on his campaign promises to make Americans safer and wealthier.

By the numbers, Trump has been very busy; he signedmore than 70 executive ordersin about six weeks. But many of his policies on immigration, tariffs, consumer prices, LGBTQ rights and cutting the government workforce are not a done deal.















Trump has taken the first steps on about two dozen promises, though obstacles, including legal challenges, could hinder his goals. In five cases, he has clearly kept his promises, including his pledges to pardon theJanuary 6, 2021, Capitol riotersand reinstate the military’stransgender ban.

His promise to end birthright citizenship is stalledafter judicial intervention. He broke apromise to end the Russia-Ukraine waron his first day in the White House, well before the tense February 28Oval Office meetingbetween him, his deputy JD Vance and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.







So far, few publicly released statistics shed light on Trump’s handling of the economy, which could be shaped by his imposition of widespread tariffs and the February wave of federal layoffs and contract cancellations. The available signals are mixed. Between Trump’s January 20 inauguration and March 3, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell by 3.3 percent, and the S&P 500 is now lower than it was on November 6, the day after the election.

Consumer confidence has turned gloomy, and Trump’s approval ratings on the economy have fallen, though they remain ahead of the level for much of President Joe Biden’s term.

Here is an overview of Trump’s progress on some of his key campaign promises.

What Trump said (February 20): “We began the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight D Eisenhower.”

Where it stands:Trump has takenstepsto increasedeportations, including securing agreements with multiple countries such as Panama, Costa Rica, and El Salvador to take people deported from the US who are not from those countries. People who are from countries that do not accept US deportation flights otherwise would be released into the US.

With limited domestic detention space, Trump has also sent immigrants toGuantanamo Bay,the naval base in Cuba best known as a high-security prison for foreign “terrorism” suspects following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. So far, there is no publicly released data showing how many people have been deported during Trump’s first month in office.







What Trump said (February 22):“I’ve ended all of the so-called diversity equity and inclusion programmes across the entire federal government and the private sector, and notified every single government DEI officer that their job has been deleted. They’re gone. They’re fired.”

Where it stands:Trump signed a January 20executive orderterminating all federal mandates, policies and programmes that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, setting off a court battle. US District Judge Adam Abelson issued a February 21 preliminary injunction to the order’s termination of federal grants or contracts the administration views as “equity-related”, calling it vague. Trump appealed. The New York Times reported on February 26 that at least 428DEI workers were put on leave.

What Trump said (February 27):“We’re going to bring so many things back to our country. And the thing that’s going to get us there is tariffs.”

Where it stands:A 10 percent tariff on China and an expansion of existing tariffs on steel and aluminium have already been in the works.Starting March 4, a new wave of tariffs came into effect. The tariff on China has increased to 20 percent, and Mexico and Canada will see 25 percent tariffs. A 25 percent tariff on the 27 European Union countries is planned “soon”, Trump said. He has also ordered top officials to draw up plans for “reciprocal” tariffs, which could hit every US trading partner.







What Trump said (February 22):“I signed an order that willend birthright citizenshipfor the children of illegal aliens because it wasn’t meant for these children.”

Where it stands:This promise, acarryover from Trump’s first term, has stalled. Multiple judges issued preliminary injunctions in February blocking the implementation of Trump’s first-day executive order declaring that future children of people in the country illegally will not receive automatic US citizenship.

What Trump said (February 26):“One of the most important initiatives is DOGE, and we have cut billions and billions and billions of dollars.

Where it stands:Trump signed a first-day executive order to create theDepartment of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Elon Musk is the driving force behind DOGE, which has attracted controversy andcourt challenges. The DOGE website’s “wall of receipts” has exaggerated its savings.







What Trump said (February 19):“It would be great to keep TikTok alive, sell it to somebody that’s going to do a great job with it.”

Where it stands:On his first day in office, Trumpdelayed a ban on TikTok, which was scheduled to take effect in January under a bipartisan 2024 law unless a US owner took over ownership from the app’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Trump’s 75-day pause said the attorney general should not enforce the law, and Trump tapped Vance and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz to oversee apotential TikTok sale.

What Trump said (February 5):“From now on, women’s sports will be only for women.”

Where it stands:Trump signed aFebruary 5 executive orderthat directs the education secretary to update regulationsprohibiting transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. Trump’s order faces lawsuits, and formal changes to Title IX regulations, which prohibit sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools, have yet to come. Twenty-five states already have laws banning transgender athletes from participating in sports teams consistent with their gender identity. The NCAA said it plans to comply with Trump’s order.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/4/is-donald-trump-keeping-his-promises-on-immigration-tariffs-and-doge
tariffs,How will Trump’s tariffs impact Mexico and Canada’s exports?,"United States President Donald Trump has implemented sweeping25 percenttariffs on Mexico and Canada.

The tariffs on the US’s biggest trading partners took effect at 00:00 Eastern Time (05:00 GMT), causingmarketsacross the globe to tumble.









Washington has also imposed an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports, adding to the 10 percent imposed last month.

Mexico and Canada are the top US trading partners, accounting for more than 30 percent of total goods traded. The value of trade among the three North American countries is more than $1.6 trillion.

Tariffs would apply to imports from Mexico and Canada of almost $918bn.



The tariffs on Mexico and Canada were among the first floated after Trump’s re-election in November. He said he is imposing them to get Mexico and Canada to curb immigration and drug trafficking into the US and to balance the trade deficit between the US and its biggest trading partners.

OnFebruary 3, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to boost border security to prevent the trafficking of drugs and flow of migrants into the US in last-minute deals to postpone tariffs that had been set to come into effect on February 4.

Last month, Trump also announced 25 percent tariffs onaluminium and steel importsthat are to come into effect on March 12, which Mexico and Canada will also be affected by.

A tariff is a government-imposed tax on imported goods and services paid by businesses bringing them into the country.

Designed to protect domestic industries, tariffs often drive up costs for consumers by making foreign products more expensive, potentially reducing demand.

When the first Trump administration introduced tariffs in 2018, the aim was to strengthen US industries and penalise foreign exporters. However, American businesses and consumers bore the greatest burden from these tariffs rather than the foreign exporters.

The 25 percent US tariff on Mexican and Canadian exports could raise costs, reduce trade, lead to job losses, create economic uncertainty and triggerretaliatorytariffs, escalating a trade war.

The US is at a trade deficit with Canada and Mexico, meaning that it is buying more goods from those countries than it is selling to them.

In a statement from theWhite Houseon February 1, Trump stated that tariffs are a powerful source of leverage for the US, arguing that while trade accounts for 67 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) and 73 percent of Mexico’s, it accounts for only 24 percent of US GDP. The US trade deficit in goods was the world’s largest at more than $1 trillion.

Mexico is the largest US trading partner. In 2024, the US imported $505.8bn in goods from Mexico and exported $334bn, resulting in a trade deficit of $171.8bn.

As the volume of trade has increased over the years, the US has consistently run a deficit with Mexico, which has expanded in the past 10 years.

The trade deficit between the two countries has increased by 12.7 percent from 2023 to 2024.



Canada is the second largest US trading partner. In 2024, the US imported $412.7bn in goods from Canada and exported $349.4bn, resulting in a trade deficit of $63.3bn.



While tariffs may aim to reduce trade deficits by reducing imports, the real impact of tariffs is more complex with the potential for retaliatory tariffs and higher prices for consumers.

In 2018 during his first term, Trump announced the USMCA as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA), which had been signed in 1992 during President George HW Bush’s administration.

The USMCA, which came into effect in 2020, aimed to modernise trade between the three countries by strengthening labour and environmental protections, increasing car-manufacturing requirements, expanding digital trade rules and enhancing intellectual property protections.

A review of the USMCA is due in 2026, but the potential threat of tariffs could lead to these negotiations happening sooner.

Mexico is one of the largest foreign suppliers of goods to the US with cars, trucks and auto parts making up the largest share of exports. Machinery and electrical equipment follow as key exports, including industrial machinery, computers and household appliances. Other major exports include petroleum products, farm products, medical devices, plastics and textiles.



According to theObservatory of Economic Complexity(OEC), Mexico’s main exports to the US in 2023 were:

Canada is the largest foreign supplier of oil to the US with energy products, including crude oil and petroleum products, accounting for about 30 percent of all Canadian exports to the US. Cars, tractors and auto parts are the second-largest export, followed by machinery and mechanical appliances. Other significant exports include medicines, plastics and wood products.

tariffs,"‘Make West great again’: Trump, Meloni optimistic on EU tariffs deal","US President Donald Trump andItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Melonihave expressed optimism about a possible United States-European Union tariffs deal as the two leaders met at the White House, as economic uncertainly roils the market.

Meloni has cast herself as the only European who can de-escalate Trump’s trade war, and she has highlighted their conservative common ground, declaring that she wants to “make the West great again.”

“There will be a trade deal, 100 percent,” Trump declared on Thursday, while Meloni said she was “sure” they could reach a deal.

The two leaders struck a warm tone during a working lunch and a meeting in the Oval Office, with Trump hailing the 48-year-old Italian leader as “fantastic”.

Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from the White House, said European leaders “are banking on Meloni” to make the bloc’s message to Trump “sound a little bit better”.

Meloni is the first European leader to visit the Republican since he slapped 20 percent tariffs on EU exports, which he has since suspended for 90 days.

The Italian leader said Trump had accepted an invitation to visit Rome in the “near future” and that he might also meet European leaders there.

“Even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions,” she said.

Meloni highlighted their shared views on immigration and “woke” ideology and added: “The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together.”

But while Trump expressed confidence about an eventual deal with the 27-nation bloc he has accused of trying to take advantage of the US, he said he was in “no rush”.

“Everybody wants to make a deal – and if they don’t want to make a deal, we’ll make the deal for them,” Trump added.







In an interview with Al Jazeera, Federiga Bindi, professor at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, said that Meloni is in a challenging position balancing the interest of Italian voters while also trying to please the whole European bloc.

“I think Meloni is trying to apply the lessons from [former Italian Prime Minister Silvio] Berlusconi. Just like she is today, he was an outcast of European politics. [Berlusconi] leveraged his relationship with George W Bush,” Bindi explained.

“Berlusconi managed to pull it. I am not sure if Meloni can manage to pull it [with Trump]. What’s different is that Berlusconi had a real friendship with Bush, which is pretty impossible to have with Trump.”

Trumprepeated his criticisms of Europe, saying it needed to “get smart” on immigration and boost defence spending on NATO.

Russia’s war in Ukraine also remained a touchy subject, with Trump telling Meloni that he was “not a big fan” of Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy.

Meloni has been a staunch ally of Zelenskyy since Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, most recently calling Moscow’s attack on the city of Sumy “horrible and vile”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/18/trump-and-italys-meloni-express-optimism-on-eu-tariff-deal
tariffs,Musk vs Navarro: Is the Trump team divided on tariffs?,"United States President Donald Trump has doubled down on his tariffs plan, even asmarkets crasharound the world.

However, signs of divisions among Trump’s aides are emerging with key ally Elon Musk and trade adviser Peter Navarro clashing in a series of tit-for-tat attacks since Saturday. Others have also presented diverging narratives.

Here is more about what has happened:

On April 2, Trump announcedsweeping tariffsimpacting most of America’s trading partners. This marked a major break from decades of US trade policy and sparked criticism and concern from economists and countries targeted by Trump’s tariffs.

In the aftermath, the three major stock indices in the US – the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq – dropped by more than 5 percent over the past week. This marked the biggest stock market drop in the US since 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Longtime Trump aide and the administration’s senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, defended the tariffs in an interview with CNN on Thursday.

“The market will find a bottom. It will be soon, and from there, we’re going to have a bullish boom, and the Dow is going to hit 50,000 during Trump’s term,” Navarro said. As of Tuesday morning, the Dow Jones was trading at less than 39,000.

After an X user posted a clip of Navarro speaking to CNN and alluded to the adviser’s doctorate from Harvard University, Musk hit back on the platform, which he owns.

“A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,” Musk posted.

The first phase of the new tariffs – 10 percent levies on countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Argentina and Saudi Arabia –came into effecton Saturday.

Higher levies that Trump callsreciprocal tariffsare scheduled to come into effect on Wednesday against countries that include China and India.

The hit against Navarro hasn’t been Musk’s only comment on tariffs in recent days.

On Saturday, Musk – who oversees the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked by Trump to slash government spending – joined a conversation by videolink with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party.

During this conversation, Musk voiced hopes for“a zero-tariff situation”between the US and Europe, even as Trump has imposed 20 percent tariffs on the European Union.

“I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said.

Musk – the world’s richest man, who is CEO of SpaceX and Tesla and the largest shareholder of both firms – has seen his firms face setbacks in recent weeks. In Europe alone, Tesla’s sales have plunged by49 percentin January and February when compared with the same months in 2024, according to a March 25 report published by the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.

Tesla’s share pricehas also stumbled. It’s about half of what it was in December.

In a Fox News interview on Sunday, Navarro responded to Musk’s comments about the tariffs in Europe.

“It was interesting to hear Elon Musk talk about a zero-tariff zone with Europe. He doesn’t understand that,” Navarro said.

“The thing that I think is important about Elon to understand is he sells cars. That’s what he does,” Navarro added, suggesting that Musk’s comments on tariffs were linked to his business interests.

Navarro said during a CNBC interview on Monday: “We all understand in the White House and the American people understand that Elon’s a car manufacturer. But he’s not a car manufacturer – he’s a car assembler.”

The trade adviser and architect of Trump’s tariffs said Musk simply wants “the cheap foreign parts” to assemble cars. Navarro added that the difference “is in our thinking and Elon’s”, adding: “We want the tyres made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here.”

Responding to this in an X post, Musk wrote on Tuesday: “Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false,” adding that “Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content.”

Last month, Tesla warned the US government that tariffs could harm electric vehicle companies when Trump’s tariff targets impose their own levies on American products.

In an unsigned letter to US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Tesla said: “US exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions.”

The company added: “Past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into those countries.”

On March 26, Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on car imports and certain automobile parts.

In response to this, Musk wrote on X: “Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.”

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News on Sunday that the 10 percent baseline tariffs will “stay in place for days and weeks” and the higher reciprocal tariffs would also take effect.

However, on the same day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC’s Meet The Press programme thatmore than 50 countrieshad reached out to Washington for negotiations to cut the levies. “The market consistently underestimates Donald Trump,” he said in response to the market crashes.

Also on Sunday, CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins whether the tariffs are here to stay like Trump and Lutnick have said. Rollins did not directly answer this question.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/7/musk-vs-navarro-is-the-trump-team-divided-on-tariffs

tariffs,China-US trade: Beijing urges Washington to remove tariffs,"Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi has called on the administration of United States President Joe Biden to work with Beijing to reopen dialogue between the two countries and to remove tariffs and sanctions, steps that would go towards restoring a bilateral relationship damaged under the presidency of Donald Trump.

Wang, a Chinese state councillor and foreign minister, said the Trump administration’s actions to suppress and contain China inflicted immeasurable harm, and called on Washington to remove “unreasonable tariffs” on Chinese goods and abandon what he said was an “irrational suppression” of the Chinese tech sector. He also cited US curbs on Chinese media and students as another issue of concern.

The Trump administration classified 15 Chinese media outlets as foreign missions as it tried to push back against what it described as communist propaganda.

In September, it cancelled the visas for more than 1,000 Chinese nationals under a May presidential decree suspending entry from China of students and researchers deemed security risks.

Wang pointed to a recent call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Biden as a positive step.

Wang’s comments, made at a forum on Monday in Beijing, come as the relationship between the world’s top two economies has reached its lowest point in decades.

The two countries fought a trade war under President Donald Trump that continues to see US tariffs applied on about $335bn of Chinese goods annually, according to the calculations by Chad Bown at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Bloomberg reported. That’s despite a phase-one agreement reached in 2020, in which China promised to purchase more American products. Beijing missed its 2020 trade-deal targets as the global pandemic upended shipping and supply chains.

Under the pact, the Asian nation pledged to buy an extra $200bn in US agriculture, energy and manufactured products over the 2017 level in the two years through the end of 2021.

The two countries have also clashed over technology, with the US seeking to curb the growth of Chinese tech companies. The Trump administration used export controls, entity lists and executive orders to block companies including Huawei Technologies Co., chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. from American goods and consumers.

The tariffs imposed by Trump and his administration sought to penalise Beijing over intellectual-property theft, allegations that China has denied. Trump also heavily relied on the Department of Treasury’s sanctions regime to punish Chinese officials involved in the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.

Wang also urged Washington to respect China’s core interests, stop interfering in Beijing’s internal affairs and stop “conniving” with separatist forces for Taiwan’s independence. Beijing considers Taiwan to be part of its territory.

“Over the past few years, the United States basically cut off bilateral dialogue at all levels,” Wang said in prepared remarks translated into English. “We stand ready to have candid communication with the US side, and engage in dialogues aimed at solving problems.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/22/senior-chinese-diplomat-urges-the-us-to-remove-tariffs
tariffs,China says it will pay no attention to Trump’s ‘tariff numbers game’,"China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said it will pay no attention to United States President Donald Trump’s “tariff numbers game” after the White House suggested Chinese exports are facing tariffs of up to 245 percent.

The White House disclosed the latest tariff rates in a fact sheet earlier this week.

The fact sheet includes Trump’s recent 125 percent tariff and earlier 20 percent tariff imposed in response to Beijing’s alleged failure to curb fentanyl exports to the US, as well as potential duties of between 7.5 percent and 100 percent that could be imposed following national security reviews launched under the Trade Act of 1974.

Beijing’s remarks on Thursday echoed those made last week by the Ministry of Finance, which described Trump’s escalating tariffs as a “joke” because they no longer have “any economic significance”.

China’s tariffs on US goods stand at 125 percent, but Beijing has also taken other non-tariff punitive measures, including limiting the release of Hollywood films.

Economists have said that Trump’s tariffs, if not eased, will bring a halt to most trade between the US and China due to the exorbitant rise in costs.

The World Trade Organization on Wednesday said that the volume of global trade is expected to decline by 0.2 percent in 2025 under current conditions – or “nearly three percentage points lower” than a low-tariff baseline scenario.

The spillover effect of Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs”,  most of which have been paused until July, could lead to an “even sharper decline of 1.5 percent in global goods trade and hurt export-oriented least-developed countries,” the WTO said.

The UN’s Trade and Development (UNCTAD) office also revised its prediction for global growth downwards from 2.5 percent to 2.3 percent in 2025, noting in its assessment that growth below a threshold of 2.5 percent often signals a global recession.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/17/china-says-it-will-pay-no-attention-to-trumps-tariff-numbers-game
tariffs,Biden ‘not there yet’ on easing tariffs on Chinese goods,"United States President Joe Biden on Wednesday said it was too soon to make commitments on lifting US tariffs on Chinese goods, but his chief trade negotiator Katherine Tai was working on the issue.

“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I could say they’re meeting their commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of them, but we’re not there yet,” Biden said, referring to China’s commitments under aPhase 1 trade dealsigned by his predecessor Donald Trump.

China has fallen far short of its pledge under the two-year trade agreement to buy $200bn in additional US goods and services by the end of 2021, and it remains unclear how the shortfall will be addressed.

Chinese purchases reached only about 60 percent of the target through November 2021, according to data compiled by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The US Census Bureau is expected to release December data next week.

Biden said he was aware that some business groups were clamouring for him to start unwinding US tariffs of up to 25 percent imposed by Trump on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, and that was why Tai was working on the issue.

But he said it was too soon to move forward given China’s failure to boost its purchases.

tariffs,Cambodia seeks China’s financial support as Xi visits amid US tariff war,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has met with Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet in Phnom Penh as China seeks to bolster regional trade ties to offset the effect of steep United Statestariffs.

As part of a three-prongedSoutheast Asia tourthat included Vietnam and Malaysia, Xi on Thursday was greeted by Cambodia’s King Norodom Sihamoni during a military welcome ceremony as he touched down in the capital.

Manet and his father, Senate Chairman Hun Sen, shared posts on their social media accounts later in the day that showed them meeting with Xi, although there were no details on any agreements that were expected.

“We expect more cooperation including on infrastructure development,” Meas Soksensan, a spokesman for the Cambodian Ministry of Economy and Finance, told the Reuters news agency on the eve of Xi’s arrival.

He was answering a question about whether Cambodia expected Beijing to announce financial support for the 180km (110-mile)Funan Techo Canal, the country’s most ambitious infrastructure project.







Phnom Penh is a close partner of China, which has invested billions of dollars in various projects, including roads and airports, and is the country’s largest creditor.

“The Trump administration is very clearly trying to isolate Beijing, and Beijing’s response is here to extend its arms to its Asian neighbours,” said Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, speaking from the Chinese capital.

Yu added that Xi received the warmest support in Cambodia on his tour because the two are “ironclad friends”, with deep military ties in addition to the infrastructure investments.

Meanwhile, Cambodia is a major exporter of clothing and footwear to the US, with half of these companies owned by Chinese business owners, Yu explained.

Phnom Penh was slapped with a US tariff rate of 49 percent, one of the highest globally, before most duties were paused until July.

“[Cambodia] will try to negotiate that [tariff rate] down, and Xi Jinping wants to remind them that, here we are friends, and we don’t want you to cut any deals at Beijing’s expense,” said Yu.

In an article published on Thursday morning in Cambodian media, Xi urged Phnom Penh to oppose “hegemonism” and “protectionism”,repeating messageshe sent earlier this week to Vietnam and Malaysia in the first two legs of his trip.

China is Cambodia’s biggest trading partner and source of investment, and more than a third of Cambodia’s $11bn in foreign debt is owed to China, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Chheang Vannarith, a political analyst and public policy lecturer, told Al Jazeera that Xi’s visit to Phnom Penh marks “a new milestone in the bilateral relationship”.

He said expectations are high for greater cooperation on infrastructure projects, as well as trade, development, tourism, technology and other sectors. “To Cambodia, China is very critical in socioeconomic development and poverty reduction,” he said.

Vannarith added that Cambodia is expected to increase its exports to China in response to tariff pressure from US President Donald Trump’s administration.

“Cambodia is trying to diversify its export products and export markets … in order to reduce a risk of over-reliance on the US market. China is emerging to be another key destination for Cambodian exports.”

So far, China has made no public financial commitment to Cambodia’s canal project, while Phnom Penh has changed its statements on Chinese engagement from covering 100 percent to 49 percent of total costs, estimated at $1.7bn.

Beijing signed no new loans to Cambodia last year, according to Cambodian official data, a marked contrast with previous years when it lent the country hundreds of millions of dollars.

The drop in funding came as China reduced overall overseas investments amid domestic economic woes and concerns over unsuccessful projects.

Despite this, Hun Manet, in a video posted on Wednesday, said the two countries had “common interests based on the principles of respect for sovereignty, equality, and noninterference in internal affairs”.

He also said China had played a “pivotal role” in Cambodia’s socioeconomic development.

tariffs,Soya beans: China and EU’s secret weapon against Trump’s tariff wars?,"European Union countries approved a set of retaliatory levies on the United States on Wednesday in response to President Donald Trump’ssweeping tariffson America’s trade partners.

The tit for tat, which goes into force on April 15, comes as China also retaliated against Trump’s tariffs this week. The unfoldingtariff spathas destabilised global markets and seen stocks fall across the board.

Trump’s latest tariffs put a 20 percent levy on all EU goods. The tariff rate is 104 percent for Chinese goods.

The EU’s actions will target US aluminium and steel products, as well as American agricultural imports – key among them being soya beans – though these tariffs will likely be rolled out in a phased manner.

One of America’s biggest imports globally, could soya prove to be Washington’s Achilles heel that trading partners, including the EU and China, use to hit back effectively?

Here’s what to know about what a soya bean trade war could mean – and why it could be a big deal for the US, economically and politically:

Soya, in the form of whole beans, animal feed, or oil, is a cornerstone of the US agricultural industry and represents one of America’s biggest agricultural revenue earners.

It accounts for about 0.6 percent of GDP. The US hasmore than 500,000 soya bean producers, according to the Department of Agriculture’s Census of Agriculture. That includes at least 223,000 full-time jobs supported by the soya bean industry, according to a 2023 report for the National Oilseed Processors Association and the United Soybean Board.

The industry is worth $124bn in the US – that’s more than the entire economy of Kenya or Bulgaria.

Although local demand for soya in the US is growing, exports form the basis of the crop’s success. The US is presently the second-largest exporter of soya beans globally, selling more than half its yield to about 80 countries.

Soya beans contributed more than $27bn of US annual exports in 2023, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), an open-source data visualisation platform.

That’s more than any other agricultural export.

China, which imports $15bn of US soya beans, is by far the most important market, followed by the EU – and especially Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, which buy about $2bn worth of the oilseed.

Yet, both China and the EU are now at the heart of a global pushback against Trump’s tariffs. They were both on the “worst offender” list of countries hit by a barrage of tariff hikes announced by Trump last week. The list included countries that Washington claimed were unfairly taxing US goods in their countries.

Trump slapped the EU with a 20 percent surcharge, apart from 25 percent levies on steel and aluminum, which form a key part of the bloc’s exports to the US.

China, in total, now faces a 104 percent tariff on all its US exports as of Wednesday.



Both entities appear to be targeting US soya, a soft spot for Washington, considering the importance of their markets to American farmers.

The EU earlier promised to target US goods worth up to €26 billion ($28bn) in retaliatory tariffs. A draft of the full list was leaked earlier but has not officially been released.

On Wednesday, the bloc voted on a surcharge of up to 25 percent on the list of targeted goods. A first set of tariffs will be enforced from April 15.

While those tariffs are expected to be enforced in phases, one of the products on the EU’s list is soya.

Meanwhile, US soya exports to China, its biggest market, are also facing a battering. China had earlier honed in on US food products, slapping a 15 percent duty on commodities like chicken, wheat and corn, while imposing a 10 percent levy on soya beans, meat and other farm exports.

On Saturday, China placed an additional 34 percent on all US goods, bringing the surcharge on soya, in particular, to 44 percent. A further 50 percent hike on all US goodswill take effecton Thursday, Beijing has announced.

That means American soya beans will now face 94 percent tariffs in China.

Experts say China can afford to gamble with soya because it has increasingly turned to Brazil for its soya imports since 2017 when the first trade war began during Trump’s first administration.

US soya exports to China have fallen in the time since, while Brazil now holds more than half of the market share. In 2024, Brazil exported $36.6bn worth of soya to China while the United States exported $12.1bn worth of soya.

https://x.com/ASA_soya beans/status/1909613301564112985

American soya farmers have urged Trump to remove tariffs on China, the EU, and other top markets like Mexico. Most have emphasised China’s importance to US farmers.

“China bought 52 percent of our (soya bean) exports in 2024,” the American Soybean Association’s chief economist, Scott Gerlt, told the AFP news agency. Given the size of its purchases, China cannot easily be replaced, he added.

Some farmers say many won’t be able to hold out for too long if the trade spat continues, as their produce would become too expensive to be competitive on the global market.

“If this trade war lasts beyond the fall, you’re going to see farmers go out of business,” soya bean farmer David Walton told US news channel ABC.

The war on soya, and indeed, the tit-for-tat tariff row, could have deep political implications.

So far, Trump has issued the policies as executive decrees, denying Congress the right to weigh in on the matter.

But Republican Congressman Don Bacon, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democrat Senator Maria Cantwell are preparing to introduce legislation that would force Trump to notify Congress of any new tariffs, with its enforcement subject to the House’s approval, according to reporting by US publications Politico and Axios. The chances of the bill passing through are slim, however, since Republicans dominate the House and Senate.

Still, whatever happens in Congress, the political consequences might be felt beyond Capitol Hill, too.

Nearly all of the American soya bean exports to the EU come from Louisiana alone, the home state of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The politician has nonetheless spoken in favour of the tariff hikes.

In a press statement last week, Johnson said Americans should “trust the president’s instinct on the economy”.

“It may be rocky in the beginning, but I think in the end it will make sense for all Americans, it will help all Americans,” he said.

tariffs,US stock market sinks lower after wild swings over Trump’s tariff plans,"US stocks have mostly closed lower after a day of wild swings in the market, as investors scrambled to make sense of United States President Donald Trump’s tariff plans.

The benchmark S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday fell 0.23 percent and 0.91 percent, respectively, racking up a third consecutive day of losses.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished slightly up, rising 0.099 percent.

The dip followed a day of volatile trading, with unfounded reports that Trump was considering a 90-day pause to his tariffs briefly sending the S&P 500 up more than 7 percent.

The index quickly reversed its gains after the White House dismissed the report, which was picked up by a number of news outlets after being circulated on social media, as “fake news”.

US stock futures, which are traded outside of usual market hours, pointed to a possible reprieve from the losing streak on Tuesday, with contracts tied to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq up 0.98 percent and 1.02 percent, respectively.

After following Wall Street’s earlier losses, some Asian markets opened higher on Tuesday.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose nearly 6 percent in early trading.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained more than 2.3 percent, after taking the biggest plunge since the 1997 Asian financial crisis in the previous session.

South Korea’s Kospi and Australia’s ASX 200 gained about 1.5 percent.

However, stocks in Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam opened sharply lower.







Despite the market turmoil and expressions of concern by top business leaders, Trump on Monday indicated that he could escalate his trade war further.

In a post on his platform Truth Social, Trump said he would slap an additional 50 percent tariff on China from Thursday if it did not scrap its planned 34 percent retaliatory duty on US imports.

“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!” Trump said.

Speaking at the White House later, Trump said a European Union proposal to exempt industrial products from tariffs did not go far enough, and clarified that his administration was “not looking” at any pause to the tariffs he has announced so far.

China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday hit back at Trump’s latest tariff threat, calling it a “mistake on top of a mistake”.

“China will never accept this,” a ministry spokesperson said.

“If the US insists on going its own way, China will fight it to the end,” the spokesperson said.

US customs authorities began imposing a baseline tariff of 10 percent on imports on Sunday, with steeper duties of between 11 percent and 50 percent set to take effect against dozens of countries on Wednesday.

China, the US’s main strategic rival and its third-largest trading partner, is facing a 34 percent tariff.

Numerous US allies are also bracing for a hit to their export markets, with the EU, Japan and South Korea facing duties of between 20 and 25 percent.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/4/8/us-stock-market-sinks-lower-after-wild-swings-over-trumps-tariff-plans
tariffs,China raises stakes in Trump’s tariffs ‘game’ with 125% levy on US goods,"China has announced it would raise tariffs on all United States goods to 125 percent, furtherdeepening a trade warbetween the world’s two largest economies.

“The US’s imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international trade rules, basic economic laws and common sense,” Beijing’s State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement announcing the retaliatory tariffs on Friday.

The new levy will take effect on Saturday, the statement said.

China and the US have been engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff war, with US President Donald Trump imposing more tariffs on Beijing earlier this week, even as he put a pause on tariffs for other nations after US markets reacted negatively to the decision.

Trump’s universal tariffs on China now total 145 percent. When he announced on Wednesday that China faced 125 percent tariffs, he did not include a 20 percent tariff on China tied to its role in fentanyl production.

Meanwhile, China’s Ministry of Commerce has announced it was filing a new lawsuit with the World Trade Organization (WTO) challenging the US tariffs, adding that the US is to blame for the global economic “turbulence” unleashed by Trump.







Washington’s levies“(caused) the current world economy, global markets and multilateral trading systems to suffer serious shocks and severe turbulence”, a ministry spokesperson said. “The US should bear full responsibility for this.”

The ministry urged the US to “take a big step forward in eliminating the so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’ and completely correct its wrongful practices”.

“The US alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,” a spokesman said.

“However, if the US insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China’s interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end,” the spokesman added.

Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, described the statements from Chinese officials as “pretty strong”.

But our correspondent also pointed out that Beijing is offering an “off-ramp” for a dialogue with Trump, noting that China “continues to be open to consultation”.

“However, threats and pressure are not the way. So China is saying it does have a door open,” she said. “But it does seem that as long as the Trump administration continues to impose these high tariffs, which Beijing perceives as coercion, then that is a non-starter for a true dialogue and a possibility of a true deal.”

Karl Widerquist, a professor at Georgetown University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that he expects the trade war between China and the US to quickly drive inflation up.

He explained that US consumers may already be rushing to buy goods even before the tariffs take effect, thus driving up demand and resulting in retailers raising prices.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/11/china-retaliates-by-raising-tariffs-on-us-goods-to-125-percent
tariffs,‘We won’t back down’: Global leaders threaten backlash to Trump auto tariff,"World leaders have denounced United States President Donald Trump for unveiling a new tariff measure, this time aimed at theautomobile industry.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney offered one of the most frank assessments, saying it signalled an end to the tight bonds his country and the US once enjoyed.

“The old relationship we had with the United States – based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation – is over,” Carney said.

“We will need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States. We will need to pivot our trade relationships elsewhere. And we will need to do things previously thought impossible, at speeds we haven’t seen in generations.”

Carney’s remarks arrived on the heels of a new executive proclamation from the Trump administration, placing a25-percent tariffon all foreign-made automobiles imported into the US, starting on April 2.

Officials in both Canada and Mexico have decried Trump’s tariff campaign as a violation of the free-trade agreement the three countries signed in 2019, during the US president’s first term.







But the United Auto Workers (UAW) – one of the most influential labour unions in the US – praised Trump’s decision as a win for domestic workers.

“We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades,” UAW President Shawn Fain wrote in a statement.

He blamed free-trade accords for sending US manufacturing jobs to cheaper markets abroad.

“These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the US,” Fain said.

But critics warn that the tariffs will not have an immediate effect on job creation for Americans, as it will take time to build new production lines in the US.

“Donald Trump says that this will help regenerate the car-building process in the United States,” explained Al Jazeera correspondent Alan Fisher.

“But, of course, if anyone is going to build a plant, it is going to take two, three, maybe four years – beyond Trump’s time in office.”

Some industry experts even predicted that the burden of tariffs could grind car manufacturing to a halt.

Flavio Volpe, the president of Canada’s Automotive Parts Manufacturing Association, explained that nearly two million automobiles constructed in Canada are made for US car companies. Those Canadian factories, meanwhile, source half of their car parts and raw materials from the US.

Volpe said that serves as an illustration of how deeply intertwined the international car industry is.

“Anything that the White House is trying to do to Canadians is going to [be done] directly to the three biggest automotive enterprises that are based in the US,” Volpe told Al Jazeera.

“The industry is likely to shut down on both sides of the border within a week,” he added.







Since the 25-percent tariffs were announced, US automaker General Motors has seen a sharp drop in its shares. It is considered one of the “Big Three” car manufacturers in the US, alongside Ford and Stellantis.

Trump has been teasing tariffs on automobile imports since the start of his second term as president.

In February, for instance, he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that the tariffs would“be in the neighbourhood of 25 percent”, but he would unveil them at a later date, to give manufacturers “a little bit of a chance” to adjust.

Media reports indicated that US carmakers were worried such tariffs would disrupt their business.

At an investor conference in February, Ford CEO Jim Farley said cross-border tariffs threatened to “blow a hole in the US industry” over the long term.

Already, US trading partners have been preparing to retaliate against the tariffs, heightening a spiralling trade war.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, for instance, said, “The US has chosen a path at whose end lie only losers, since tariffs and isolation hurt prosperity for everyone.”

Carney likewise hinted at negative outcomes for the global economy – and a firm response from Canada.

“We will fight the US tariffs with retaliatory trade actions of our own that will have maximum impact in the United States and minimum impacts here in Canada,” Carney said.

Let’s be clear. We’re all on the same page. We won’t back down. We will respond forcefully. Nothing is off the table to defend our workers and our country.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/27/we-wont-back-down-global-leaders-threaten-backlash-to-trump-auto-tariff
tariffs,Trump’s tariff war: What’s at stake for China’s economy?,"It’s started.

At 12.01am EST (04:01 GMT) on Wednesday, United States President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” trade tariffs kicked in. And no country has been hit worse than China, which now effectively faces a 125 percent levy on the goods it sells to the US.

Even as Washington moved tostart negotiationswith other trading partners targeted by tariffs, a day of increasing back-and-forth levies between the world’s two largest economies meant that anything the US imports from China will cost more than double what it did two months ago. China has raised its US tariffs to 84 percent.

Stock markets have nosedivedsince last week’s announcement of US tariffs on dozens of countries, as investors braced for the fallout from what is now a global trade war.

For his part, Trump has long accused other countries – especially China – of exploiting the US on trade, casting his protectionist agenda as necessary to revive domestic manufacturing and re-shore American jobs.

On February 3, Trump imposed an extra 10 percent tariff onall goods from China, on top of various tariffs levied during the first Trump administration in 2017-2021 and the administration of former US President Joe Biden in 2021-2025.

Then, on March 5, Trump doubled the rate onChinese importsto 20 percent. On April 2, he lifted it again by another 34 percent – stacking up to 54 percent in total.

Last Friday, on April 4, China announced a 34 percent reciprocal tariff on US imports.

Trump raised the temperature again by threatening still more tariffs unless Beijing withdrew its levies on US goods.

“If China does not withdraw its 34 percent increase above their already long-term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trumpsaidon his Truth Social platform on Monday. With that additional tariff, the levy rate on Chinese imports jumped to 104 percent.

As the hours ticked away, Trump remained confident that Beijing would buckle. “China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started,” the US president wrote in a social media post. “We are waiting for their call. It will happen!”

It didn’t. Instead, Beijing raised its tariff on US goods to 84 percent on Wednesday.

Hours later, Trump hit back again, raising tariffs on China still further — now to 125 percent.

Announcing its latest round of tariffs on US exports on April 9, China’s Commerce Ministry said that Beijing “has the firm will and abundant means to take necessary countermeasures and fight to the end”.

“History and facts have proven that the United States’ increase in tariffs will not solve its own problems,” said the policy statement.

“Instead, it will trigger sharp fluctuations in financial markets, push up US inflation pressure, weaken the US industrial base and increase the risk of a US economic recession, which will ultimately only backfire on itself.

In a statement the previous day, on April 8, the Ministry of Commerce also made combative overtures, saying Washington’s actions were​ “completely groundless” and a form of economic “bullying”.

Beijingdefendedits reciprocal tariffs and said they were aimed at safeguarding China’s “sovereignty, security and development interests”, as well as maintaining a balanced international trade market.

Elsewhere, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said “We Chinese are not troublemakers, but we will not flinch when trouble comes our way.”

Despite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trade partners.

According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, America imported$438.9bnin Chinese goods last year.

That amounts to roughly 3 percent of China’s total gross domestic product (GDP), which is heavily reliant on exports.

In a report shared with clients on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it expects Trump’s latest tariffs would drag down China’s GDP by as much as 2.4 percent.

The investment bank is forecasting 4.5 percent growth for this year, citing concerns that China’s proven tactic of rerouting exports through countries like Vietnam and Thailand – to bypass US tariffs – will become less effective now that Trump has erected trade barriers globally.

That 4.5 percent is lower than the Chinese government’s official growth target of 5 percent for 2025.

Analysts at UBS are even more pessimistic: They’ve said that Trump’s tariff hikes could reduce China’s economic growth rate to just 4 percent in 2025. And that’s assuming the government engages in “broad fiscal expansion” [i.e. extra public investment].

China’s economy has already been growing at a slower pace than when Trump first took office. The latest trade war comes as China is struggling with deflation, a crisis-stricken property market and elevated debt levels.

In 2018, when Trump launched his first trade war against China, Beijing’s official GDP growth figure was 6.6 percent.

Still, for Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, China is still “better prepared than most countries” to handle the fallout from Trump’s trade salvoes.

Al Jazeera’s Beijing correspondent Katrina Yu says Chinese officials are working to guard against shocks in the stock market.

“The government does have the ability to intervene strongly,” Yu said.

On Tuesday, China’s Premier Li Qiang said that the government is “fully capable of hedging against adverse external influences”.

The same day, several public investment firms – such as Chengtong and Huijin – vowed to increase equity investments and stem financial market selloffs.

Yu noted that Chinese stock exchanges have performed better than elsewhere in Asia.

Shanghai’s SSE Composite Index posted gains of 1.1 percent on Wednesday, while Shenzhen’s SE Composite rose 2.2 percent. Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei index closed down by 3.9 percent.

“The [Chinese] government is really looking to stabilise the stock market. It seems to be working so far, but investors here … some of them are still very anxious,” Yu said.

To mitigate the impact of tariffs, Beijing will probably focus on domestic stimulus and boosting ties with its trading partners to achieve a growth target of “around 5 percent”, said Ghosh, the economics professor.

“I expect further reductions in China’s [already] low interest rates along with more borrowing by local governments and assistance for affected export workers,” she told Al Jazeera.

Ghosh suggested that China would “quietly” boost exports to trading partners, particularly in the Global South, through measures like “loans and debt relief”.

She also said China’s central bank might allow the yuan to depreciate, thereby lowering export prices and offsetting some of the losses from tariffs.

Though Ghosh said that China’s $20 trillion economy “should be able to absorb” the hit from US tariffs, some economists have expressed concern about Beijing’s fiscal position.

On April 3, ratings agency Fitch downgraded China’s sovereign credit rating, citing rapidly rising government debt and risks to public finances, as policymakers gear up to shield the economy from rising tariffs.

For Ghosh, however, “there is a Western tendency to see the imminent collapse of the Chinese economy”.

“I’m far more concerned about the US economy,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/9/trumps-tariff-war-whats-at-stake-for-chinas-economy
tariffs,Trump says reciprocal tariffs will target ‘all countries’,"United States President Donald Trump has said his soon-to-be-announced reciprocal tariffs will apply to “all countries”, pouring cold water on hopes that only economies with the biggest trade imbalances with the US would be targeted.

Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said that his long-anticipated tariff announcement on April 2 would “start” with all countries.

You’d start with all countries,” Trump told reporters. “Essentially, all of the countries that we’re talking about.”

Trump’s remarks come after his administration had played down the scope of the tariffs set to be unveiled on April 2, which the US president has dubbed “liberation day”.

White House economics adviser Kevin Hassett suggested earlier this month that the measures would be heavily focused on 10 to 15 countries that account for the bulk of the US trade deficit.

“There are more than 100 countries that don’t really have any tariffs on us and don’t have any non-tariff barriers,” Hassett said in an interview with Fox Business.

Trump himself also appeared to play down the severity of the upcoming tariffs last week, saying the reciprocal measures would be “very lenient” and that people would be “surprised”.

While the specific details of Trump’s plans are unclear, his administration has pledged to hit countries with duties that are equal to the tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, such as subsidies, that they impose on US exports.

Trump, who last week announced a 25 percent tariff on all auto imports, has long accused other countries of exploiting the US on trade, casting his protectionist economic agenda as necessary to revive domestic manufacturing and create jobs.

Trump’s latest tariffs on cars and other vehicles have strained Washington’s relations with some of its closest partners and allies, including Canada, the European Union and Japan, all of which have large automotive industries.

Trump’s back-and-forth announcements on tariffs have also sent jitters through global markets, with investors struggling to gauge if the US president intends to make his tariffs permanent or views them as primarily a bargaining tool.

Trump said last week that he was “certainly open” to making deals with countries to avoid the tariffs after the April 2 announcement.

Asian stock markets fell sharply on Monday in anticipation of further disruption to global trade.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 and South Korea’s benchmark KOSPI were down 3.85 percent and 2.55 percent, respectively, as of 03:00 GMT.

Australia’s ASX 200 had fallen 1.56 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.20 percent.

tariffs,Fact check: Are other countries ‘cheating’ the US on trade?,"If you listen to President Donald Trump and his allies discuss his sweeping tariff plans, one word pops up a lot: “Cheating”.

During his April 2 announcement of what he called “Liberation Day”, Trump released alistof new tariffs of up to 50 percent on virtually every country – a plan that took effect at midnight on April 9 before he abruptly issued a 90-day pause hours later. (His April 9 change in course increased tariffs onChinaand kept a 10 percent across-the-board tariff on virtually all trading partners.)

When he unveiled his initial tariffs plan, Trump said, “For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating.”

Over the next few days, other administration figures echoed the “cheating” accusation.

“Our leaders allowed foreign countries to rig the rules of the game, to cheat, to steal, to rob, to plunder,” White House adviser Stephen Miller said on April 4 on Fox News. “That has cost America trillions of dollars in wealth. … They’ve stolen our industries.”

White House adviserPeter Navarrosaid in an April 6 Fox News interview, “It’s all these things that these foreign countries do that are designed explicitly to cheat us and are sanctioned by the World Trade Organization.”

Are the countries facing these now-paused tariffs really cheating the US on trade?

The White House didn’t provide any evidence.

While cheating on trade does happen – genuine accusations of it can be adjudicated at the World Trade Organization – the White House’s formula for calculating tariff rates leaned on how much of a trade imbalance a country has with the US, not on evidence of cheating.

Trump and his allies “tend to use the term ‘cheating’ as any action by a foreign country that leads to a bilateral goods trade deficit with the US”, said Kent Jones, professor emeritus of economics at Babson College, who specialises in trade policy. “On the face of it, this definition has no economic validity, since bilateral trade balances are generally determined not by trade and other government policies, but by specific patterns of trade by commodity.”

Our analysis of the 10 countries with the highest announced tariff rates on April 2 showed they are largely poor and small – and it is thesefactors, rather than unfair trade practices, that made them susceptible to the highest rates. Such countries export the resources they have and are too small and too poor, or both, to buy much from the United States.

The White House did not respond to inquiries for this article. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said at the April 8 daily briefing that the country-by-country tariff rates were “very carefully crafted” and that they focused on both tariffs levied by the trading partner and “non-monetary” factors, such as regulations that inhibit trade.

There are ways a country can “cheat” on trade, by ignoring rules and norms of international trade policy. One way is “dumping”, which means selling a product to a trading partner for an artificially discounted price. Another is through excessive government subsidies to producers, something the US and other countries have accused China of doing. Several of these complaints have been upheld when taken to the WTO.

In these cases, the trade partner can assess duties – taxes on the imported goods – to try to cancel out the distortion. If this process cannot be resolved amicably, the parties can go to the World Trade Organization to arbitrate the dispute.

“A good example of this is the decades-long softwood lumber trade dispute between Canada and the US, where the US claims that Canada unfairly subsidises their softwood lumber industry through administratively determined fees, while Canada counters that nearly all of its lumber is on provincial public land and thus must come under provincial regulation,” said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist who specialises in trade policy.

Another type of cheating involves currency manipulation, in which a country interferes with the exchange rate for its currency in ways that make its exports cheaper to foreign buyers. This is something the US and other countries have accused China of doing.

Sometimes, trading partners have accused the US of cheating; critics have chafed when the US bans the trade of certain products by saying they would threaten national security.

One could argue that Trump “cheated” in recent weeks by placing newtariffson Canada and Mexico, reneging on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that he negotiated during his first term. That agreement set the trade rules among the three countries, and it did not allow the extra tariffs Trump imposed on both.







The White House’s formula for calculating the April 2 tariffs plan came from some basic numerical inputs. The formula took the US trade deficit in goods (but not services) with a particular country, divided it by the total goods imported from that country, then divided that by two. Even if this calculation produced a small result, every country starts at a minimum of 10 percent.

Although some have criticised this formula, it’s based largely on how much of a trade deficit the US has with a given country. Nothing in that formula accounts for actions that are commonly considered by trade law or norms to be a type of “cheating”.

Many of these trade imbalances can be explained by factors that have nothing to do with breaking the rules.

We looked at the 10countriesor territories that Trump’s April 2 plan assigned the highest tariff rates: Lesotho (50 percent), Saint Pierre and Miquelon (50 percent), Cambodia (49 percent), Laos (48 percent), Madagascar (47 percent), Vietnam (46 percent), Sri Lanka (44 percent), Myanmar (44 percent), the Falkland Islands (42 percent), and Syria (41 percent).

One thing these countries have in common is a high ratio of exports to the US compared with their imports from the US. For instance, the value ofLesotho’s exports to the US is roughly 85 times the value of its imports from the US. The closest ratio, for Syria, is still 5-to-1 exports to imports.

These countries share other characteristics. One is that they are poor compared with the US.

In gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, a common measurement of income by country, the US figure is 163 times Madagascar’s. The most equal nation is Vietnam, but even here the US GDP per capita is 19 times Vietnam’s.

These countries are also small in population. The United States’ population is 100,000 times as large as that of the Falkland Islands. The closest any of these countries gets is Vietnam; the US is about three times as populous.

Most of these countries account for a tiny fraction of the United States’ overall trade volume. Vietnam has the biggest share; its exports account for just more than 4 percent of total US imports. The other nine are far smaller, with none exceeding a half-percentage-point share of US trade.

Experts say it’s natural for small, poor countries to have tradesurpluseswith the United States.

Madagascar, an island nation off Africa’s mainland, “has roughly 80 percent of the global supply of vanilla”, Burkhart said. “The US cannot produce vanilla, but needs it in foodstuffs, so purchases it. Madagascar is a relatively poor country, so it cannot make up in purchases what it makes in exported vanilla.”

Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a French territory off the coast of Canada, “exported a massive halibut catch to the US in 2024 as part of a territorial fisheries dispute”, Burkhart said. But with only 5,500 people, the island territory is “so small that it hardly purchases anything from the US”.

Lesotho, a country landlocked by South Africa, “exports diamonds and textiles and doesn’t import many expensive capital- and technology-intensive US goods”, Jones said. “Why should its bilateral trade with the US be balanced?”

Experts said it is unrealistic to expect that tariffs will change the trade imbalances of these small economies. “There’s just no way the average resident of Madagascar will be able to buy a Cadillac Escalade,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum, referring to a US-manufactured SUV that can cost from $87,000 to more than $160,000.

Rather, these countries are playing the economic hand that climate, location and natural resources have dealt them. In Sri Lanka, the chief export is tea; in war-torn Syria, it’s olive oil; in Laos, one of the exports is potash, an agricultural input.

Even if these countries were to achieve balanced trade with the US, that wouldn’t necessarily save them from tariffs. In 2024, the US had trade surpluses with countries such as The Netherlands, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, the United Kingdom, Panama, Brazil, Belgium and the Dominican Republic, yet these countries stand to be hit with the 10 percent minimum tariff.

One thing the top 10 countries aren’t doing is cheating on trade, experts agreed.

“If Trump wants to argue that their tariffs on US goods are too high, or they are manipulating their currency values, or they are dumping, or they are using clandestine internal tax systems and regulations to disadvantage US exports,” Jones said, “he could document these practices and use US trade laws to justify administrative trade restrictions to correct them.”

tariffs,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.
