Donald Trump,Profile: Donald Trump,"The Donald Trump you first came across depends largely on the decade in which you spent your formative years.

If you were raised in the 1970s, it will be the fledgling New York property developer working on renovating some of the city’s most iconic buildings with what he would later describe as a “small loan of a million dollars” from his father.









In the 80s, the now-accomplished businessman became widely known for his New York Times bestseller, The Art of the Deal, in which he detailed the path to his riches.

OPINION: Donald Trump – The Islamophobia president

The 90s made Trump a fixture of popular culture as the owner of the Miss Universe beauty pageant and a cameo actor in some of the decade’s most popular TV shows and movies, includingHome Alone 2, Sex and the City and the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

By the turn of the millennium, Trump reached global stardom with the TV show The Apprentice. His signature phrase, “You’re fired”, aimed at losing contestants on the show, took on a life of its own as one of the staple catchphrases of the reality TV era.

The jump between business and politics has never been grand, and Trump flirted with the idea of several political candidacies from the 80s onwards.

For two decades from 1988, the property mogul drifted between the Democrats and the Republicans but finally settled on the latter after the election of current US President Barack Obama, towards whom he quickly established a vicious enmity.

Trump helped promulgate conspiracy theories that the US leader had lied about being born in the US, therefore invalidating his right to the presidency.

Despite readyaccessibility to evidencethat Obama was born in the United States, Trump only accepted this during the later stages of his current run for presidency in 2016.

Trump’s run at the presidency marked an ascent that has defied expectation from political analysts, the media, and rivals in both major US parties alike.

Trump has survived not only the fallout from his populist rhetorical outbursts during the campaign but alsorevelations dating back decadesinvolving racism, sexual harassment, tax avoidance, among other accusations.

REPORTER’S NOTEBOOK: Donald Trump viewed from Russia

A pledge to ban Muslims from entering the US, calling immigrants from Mexico rapists, attacking the family of a US soldier killed in Iraq, mocking a disabled New York Times reporter, leaks detailing boasts of unsolicited sexual advances in graphic detail – Trump has survived the fallout of all plus more.

Even though most polls gave his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton a slight edge, Trump won because he had the backing of large swaths of the country, for whom he – the self-proclaimed outsider – is a voice of protest against the establishment.

Donald Trump,Trump arrives in Saudi Arabia in first foreign trip,"US PresidentDonald Trumphas arrived inSaudi Arabiaon the first leg of his first foreign trip since taking office, in a crucial test abroad as political scandals mount at home.









In a red-carpet airport welcome, Saudi KingSalman bin Abdulaziz Al Saudgreeted Trump, his wife Melania and his entourage shortly after they landed in the capital, Riyadh, around 06:50 GMT on Saturday.









Trump will hold a series of meetings with the king and other Arab and Muslim leaders on Saturday and Sunday, before jetting off toIsrael, the occupied Palestinian territories, theVatican, Belgium and Italy in a nine-day tour across theMiddle Eastand Europe.

During the two-day visit to the kingdom, Trump is expected to sign a major weapons deal, give a speech onIslamand discuss the battle against “terrorism” with more than 50 leaders.

It is the first time a US president has chosen Saudi Arabia as the first stop on a maiden trip.

Trump’s visit is seen as highly symbolic, as he looks to repair Washington’s ties with its closest Arab ally.

During the final years of Barack Obama’s US presidency, “relations had undergone a period of difference of opinion”, according to Saudi officials. These differences werelargely centred around the 2015 Iran nuclear dealand the Obama administration’s cautions to the kingdom about the civilian toll of the war in Yemen.

Al Jazeera’s Washington editor James Bays, reporting from Riyadh, said the Saudis were very “proud and excited” that the US president chose the Gulf country as his first stop.

“They want a reset of the relationship with the US. They were not happy with Obama, and they were not happy with the US policy in Yemen and in Syria,” Bays said.

Ahmed Alibrahim, a Saudi political analyst, told Al Jazeera that the Saudis see this as a “great day” for relations with theUS.

“We think President Trump’s cabinet does understand the Saudi challenges and does understand the challenges the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] faces.”

He added that the kingdom would like to see more “decisive statements, actions and sanctions on the Iranian regime”.

Before the trip, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeirsaidthe visit will “bolster the strategic partnership between the two countries”.

He added that “several agreements will be signed, including political agreements … and big economic agreements”.

Marwan Kabalan, an analyst at the Doha Institute’s Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, told Al Jazeera the US andSaudi Arabiawill discuss a strategic plan aimed at countering “extremism” as an ideological battle.

“I think both sides have high expectations of this summit, as they are expected to discuss the most pressing issues for both of them like the conflict in Yemen, the war in Syria and the war on ISIL,” Kabalan said, referring to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant armed group, also known asISIS.

“Trump is expected to address the entire Islamic world while trying to establish this sort of a strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia, particularly concerning groups like ISIL.”

On Saturday, Trump is expected to announce an arms deal with Saudi Arabia worth more than $100bn, in what could be the biggest such agreement in history.









Speaking on condition of anonymity, US officials familiar with the package told the Associated Press news agency that the deal would include Abrams tanks, combat ships, missile defence systems, radar and communications and cybersecurity technology.

Much of the package builds on commitments made before Trump took office, although some elements are new, including weapons designed to help Saudi Arabia in an air campaign it has led in war-tornYemen, officials said.

The Trump administration separately informed Congress on Friday that it will sell some $500m in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. These include laser-guided Paveway II bombs and JDAM kits for converting unguided bombs into “smart bombs”.

Also on the agenda in Riyadh is a summit of more than 50 Arab and Muslim leaders, including those from the six nations that form the Gulf Cooperation Council, to discuss the fight against “extremism”.

Announcing the meeting, the Saudi foreign ministry said the “historic summit” should be the start to “building a partnership between the Arab and Muslim worlds and the United States at various levels”.

INTERACTIVE: A timeline of US-Saudi relations

Trump is expected to give a speech on Islam, calling for unity in the fight against “radicalism” and characterising the effort as a “battle between good and evil”, the AP reported, citing a draft of his speech.

The US president will avoid tough anti-Muslim rhetoric from his presidential campaign, as well as mentions of democracy and human rights, according to the draft of the speech, which remains subject to revision, AP said.

According to Al Jazeera’s Bays, the meeting will also include talks on Trump’s promise to restart peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis.

“Everyone agrees that a fresh approach could be helpful in solving this long-running conflict and President Trump certainly brings that – but Arab leaders will want to hear more than optimism, they’ll want to know the US president’s plan to move forward,” Bays said.

After the visit in Saudi Arabia, Trump will head to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories where he will meet his “friend” Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuin Jerusalem and Palestinian PresidentMahmoud Abbasin Bethlehem.

There are no plans for Trump to bring the two leaders together, a senior US official told the Reuters news agency, saying the administration does not believe it is the “right time just yet”.

Trump will then fly to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis, who has said he will give the US president an open-minded hearing, despite differences in belief on everything from climate change to policies towardsrefugees.

Trump will later meet members ofNATOin Brussels and attend a G7 summit inItaly.

OPINION: The US’ never-ending days of reckoning

The foreign trip comes as Trump faces growing criticism at home.

As the US president jetted off to Saudi Arabia, reports by US media emerged that a senior adviser to Trump was a “person of interest” in a probe of possible collusion with Russia during last year’s election campaign and that the US president had boasted to Russian officials afterfiringformer FBI Director James Comey earlier this month.

Donald Trump,How much will Donald Trump’s tariffs cost US families?,"United States President Donald Trump’s broad array oftariffs on foreign goodshas spooked consumers, businesses and the stock market. But what will the specific impact be for typical American consumers?

US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered a figure on April 27 on CNN’s State of the Union.

The Democrat from New York said, as a candidate, Trump never fully explained to voters that tariffs wouldraise their costs. “It’s estimated it’ll raise the American costs … American families would have to pay about $4,000 more a year,” he said.

Calculating how typicalhouseholdswould be hit involves estimation and assumptions, especially given Trump’s frequent tinkering with what items will be tariffed and when. But Schumer’s figure is roughly in line with four independent estimates that PolitiFact identified.

Four of five estimates by groups with varying political ideologies range from $3,100 to $4,900 a year; the midpoint of that range is in line with Schumer’s figure. A fifth group estimated the cost to consumers would be $1,243.

The estimate variations stem from the groups’ differing assumptions about how the tariffs will be absorbed into the economy.

Schumer’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.

We identified five estimates on Trump’stariffs’ effecton US families, based on the tariffs he imposed before April 2 (including those onCanada and Mexico), the 10 percent across-the-board tariffs on virtually every country, and the 145 percent tariff on China. The estimates do not include the impact of higher country-by-country tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 but paused for 90 days beginning on April 9.

Here are the estimates in descending order.

Yale Budget Lab:The most recent estimate from the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University shows an average loss per household of $4,900. The lab also offered a more limited calculation that accounts for changes in consumer behaviour because of tariffs without factoring those in as losses; this worked out to a $2,600 loss per family.

The analysis found that low-earning families would be hit hardest. A family earning roughly $30,000 to $40,000 would lose 5.1 percent of its income, more than twice the proportional hit for a family earning well above $100,000.

Center for American Progress:The liberal group estimated an average loss of $4,600 annually.

American Action Forum:The centre-right think tank told PolitiFact that its pre-April 9 estimate of $3,900 loss per household remains a solid guess even though it was calculated using a 60 percent tariff on China, rather than the current 145 percent. Jacob Jensen, the group’s trade policy analyst, said tariffs as high as 145 percent curb consumer purchases so much that they tend to bring in less revenue than tariffs that are set at lower rates.

Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center:The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the average household loss would be $3,100.

Tax Foundation:The centre-right Tax Foundation put the average loss lower than the other four, at $1,243.

Erica York, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of federal tax policy, told PolitiFact that her group’s analysis has a more limited scope, encompassing households’ 2025 direct losses of income from higher taxes.

York said other groups’ estimates go beyond this, including loss in quality of life from having to switch to inferior products, factoring in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy response or using 2026 – assuming that it produces a full year of impact – rather than 2025, when the tariffs will be in force for less than a full year.

Differing methods such as these would produce variations in numbers, she said, citing the Yale Budget Lab’s dual estimates as an example.







Schumer said “it’s estimated” that Trump’s tariffs will mean “American families would have to pay about $4,000 more a year”.

Calculating the tariffs’ impact requires guesswork and is complicated by Trump’s frequent pauses on certain tariffs.

Four independent groups’ estimates range from $3,100 a year to $4,900 a year on average. The fifth, using a more restrictive method, estimated a $1,243 loss.

Donald Trump,Key takeaways from Donald Trump’s meeting with Canada’s PM Mark Carney,"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has made his much-anticipated first visit to the White House, as his country and the United States continue to spar over trade, tariffs and the prospect of reimagining their shared borders.

Seated across from Carney in the Oval Office on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump continued to advocate for Canada becoming part of its southern neighbour.

But Carneyreiterated his firm commitmentto defending Canadian sovereignty, though he spoke only briefly during his half-hour appearance with Trump in the Oval Office.

“As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,” Carney told Trump, in a gesture to the president’s background as a real-estate developer.

He then referenced his mandate from Canada’s recent federal elections, which reflected growing anti-Trump sentiment among Canadian voters.

“Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign these last several months, it’s not for sale — won’t be for sale — ever,” Carney said of his country.

Overall, however, the meeting was cordial, with the two leaders exchanging warm words and Trump teasing a breakthrough with the Houthis, an armed group in Yemen.

Here are five key takeaways from their meeting.

Carney’s appearance at the White House comes just over a week after his country’s federal elections on April 28, which saw Trump emerge as a defining force.

While the research firm Ipsos found that affordability and the cost of living topped the list of voter concerns in Canada,24 percentof respondents identified Canada’s increasingly fractious relationship with the US as a leading issue as well.

A separate Ipsospollfound that more voters trusted Carney to handle Trump than any other candidate.

The centre-left Liberals ultimately won 169 seats out of 343, enough to form a minority government — and enough for Carney, the Liberal leader, to remain Canada’s prime minister.

But that was a stark reversal from the Liberal Party’s sagging poll numbers at the start of the year. Experts believe Trump’s second term, which began on January 20, helped propel the Liberal Party’s comeback.

His remarks about Canada becoming a US state and his aggressive tariff policy alienated many Canadians, who felt their country’s close ties with the US had soured.

And some voters feared that Canada’s Conservative Party — which had previously been the frontrunner in the elections — might capitulate to Trump’s demands.

As Trump opened his sit-down on Tuesday with Carney, he gave a nod to the Liberals’ come-from-behind victory, joking that he took partial credit for the party’s electoral success.

“I think I was probably the greatest thing that happened to him,” Trump said of Carney.

“But I can’t take full credit. His party was losing by a lot. And he ended up winning. So I really want to congratulate him. It was probably one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics. Maybe even greater than mine.”

Trump proceeded to shower Carney with praise, calling him a “very good” and “very talented person” with whom he had “a lot of things in common”.

By contrast, the US president launched barbs at Carney’s predecessor, fellow Liberal Justin Trudeau, who served as Canada’s prime minister from 2015 until March of this year.

“I didn’t like his predecessor,” Trump said shortly. He also hinted at other tense relationships with other world leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he had anOval Office shouting matchin February.

“ This is very friendly. This is not gonna be like we had another little blow-up with somebody else. It was a much different. This is a very friendly conversation,” Trump said.

Carney, for his part, responded with compliments of his own for Trump.

“You’re a transformational president,” Carney said at the outset, praising the US president’s “relentless focus on the American worker”. He also drew a parallel between Trump’s leadership and his own, saying he had been elected “to transform Canada, with a similar focus on the economy” and “securing our borders”.

“The history of Canada and the US is we’re stronger when we work together, and there are many opportunities to work together,” Carney said. “I look forward to addressing some of those issues that we have, but also finding those areas of mutual cooperation so we can go forward.”







The two leaders’ conversation, however, quickly shifted to one of the most contentious issues facing their countries’ ties: Trump’s threats to make Canada part of the US.

Since December, Trump has made regular remarks that Canada should be absorbed into the US as a 51st state, owing to an imbalance of trade.

According to the US government, Canada is the largest destination for US exports and one of its top three sources for imports. But Canada exports more to the US than it imports, creating a deficit of $63.3bn in Canada’s favour.

Experts say trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing: They can indicate a stronger consumer base or differences in currency value. But Trump has repeatedly framed the US’s trade deficit with Canada as a “subsidy” that keeps the country’s economy afloat.

In the lead-up to Tuesday’s meeting, the US president pledged to broach the issue of statehood with Carney. “I’ll always talk about that,” he told the TV news programme Meet the Press on Saturday.

But during the public portion of their meeting, Trump took a more subdued approach, saying that, while he believed statehood to be a boon for Canada, he would not force the issue.

“I still believe that, but it takes two to tango, right?” Trump told reporters. He later added, “I do feel it’s much better for Canada. But we’re not gonna be discussing that unless somebody wants to discuss it.”

He nevertheless revisited familiar arguments for combining the two countries, including that statehood would allow Canada to avoid the steep 25-percent tariffs the US has placed on many of its exports, including steel and aluminium.

“I believe it would be a massive tax cut for the Canadian citizens. You get free military, you get tremendous medical care and other things. There would be a lot of advantages, but it would be a massive tax cut,” he said.

When Carney responded that Canada was “not for sale”, Trump doubled down, saying, “Never say never.”

But Carney scrunched up his face with a cheeky look and appeared to mouth the word “never” multiple times to the journalists circled around them.

He also attempted to steer the discussion to more neutral ground, praising Trump for pushing Western powers to invest more in military defence.

Still, reporters continued to press the two leaders about the controversial remarks. One asked Trump whether he would accept the will of the Canadian people not to become a 51st state.

“Sure, I would,” Trump replied. “But this is not necessarily a one-day deal. This is over a period of time they have to make that decision.”

Carney once again chimed in with a brief but blunt response. “Respectfully, Canadians’ view on this is not going to change.”

Later, outside the Canadian embassy in Washington, DC, Carney described the Oval Office meeting as a turning point for their bilateral ties.

“ Today marked the end of the beginning of a process of the United States and Canada redefining that relationship of working together,” Carney said. “The question is how we will cooperate in the future.”

In the Oval Office, Trump was unwavering in his commitment to imposing tariffs on Canada, describing the import taxes as essential to protecting US industries from competition.

“Is there anything he can say to you in the course of your meeting with him today that can get you to lift tariffs on Canada?” a reporter in the Oval Office asked.

Trump responded with uncharacteristic brevity: “No.”

He later explained that it was his hope to create US industries that relied on no outside support, not even from close allies like Canada, whose economy is intimately interwoven with that of its southern neighbour.

Trump referenced the decline of the American auto and steel industries as motives for his tariffs.

“We want to make our own cars. We don’t really want cars from Canada, and we put tariffs on cars from Canada. At a certain point, it won’t make economic sense for Canada to build those cars,” Trump said. “And we don’t want steel from Canada because we’re making our own steel, and we’re having massive steel plants being built right now as we speak.”

He also repeated his false assertion that the US trade deficit with Canada amounted to a “subsidy” — and he appeared to cast doubt about whether Canada’s economy would survive without US support.

“They have a surplus with us, and there’s no reason for us to be subsidising Canada,” Trump said. “Canada will have to be able to take care of itself economically. I assume they can.”

Carney, meanwhile, highlighted the close relations the US and Canada have enjoyed in the past, arguing that cross-border trade has made both of their economies stronger.

“We are the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods. So we are the largest client in the United States,” he said. “Fifty percent of a car that comes from Canada is American. That’s not like anywhere else in the world.”

Both leaders agreed that the current United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) needed to be renegotiated. Canada has framed Trump’s tariffs as a violation of the free-trade agreement, which was signed under the US president’s first term in 2019.

“ The USMCA is great for all countries,” Trump said during Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting. But he added that the deal was a “transitional step” that would “get renegotiated very shortly”.

Carney echoed that assessment, saying that the USMCA would be a launchpad for broader discussions.

“It is a basis for a broader negotiation. Some things about it are going to have to change,” he said, offering measured criticism of Trump’s tariff policy. “Part of the way you’ve conducted these tariffs has taken advantage of existing aspects of USMCA, so it’s going to have to change.”

While much of the Oval Office discussion revolved around trade, Trump briefly veered into the topic of international conflicts, saying that the war in Ukraine would feature heavily in his closed-door discussions with Carney.

He also announced his administration would end its nearly two-month-long bombing campaign in Yemen, where the US military has beenattackingHouthi strongholds.

The US Central Command has said more than 800 targets have been bombed since Trump began the US’s latest round of strikes on March 15, known as Operation Rough Rider.

But the effort has been riddled with controversy. Aid groups have warned of civilian casualties, including the suspected bombing of amigrant centrein Saada, in Yemen’s north. And details of the initial strikeswere accidentally leakedto a journalist on the messaging app Signal, spurring questions about mismanagement within the Trump White House.

But on Tuesday, Trump announced a shift in the ongoing fight with the Houthis.

“We had some very good news last night,” Trump said. “They’ve announced — to us, at least — that they don’t want to fight anymore. They just don’t want to fight. And we will honour that. And we will stop the bombings.”

The Houthis had been launching attacks against commercial vessels and naval ships in the Red Sea, as part of the group’s opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 52,615 Palestinians.

“They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. And that’s the purpose of what we were doing,” Trump added. “We are going to stop the bombing of the Houthis effective immediately.”

Shortly thereafter, a senior Houthi official posted on social media that the deal stillneeded to be “evaluatedon the ground first”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/6/key-takeaways-from-donald-trumps-meeting-with-canadas-pm-mark-carney
Donald Trump,Trump loses defamation liability appeal in E Jean Carroll case,"United States President-elect Donald Trump has lost an appeal to a jury’s 2023 finding that he wasliable for sexual abuseand defamation related to an alleged attack on writer E Jean Carroll in the 1990s.

On Monday, a federal appeals court upheld the 2023 verdict in the civil case, in which Trump was not found to have committed rape, but was ordered to pay Carroll $2.02m for sexual assault and $2.98m for defamation.

Carroll had accused Trump of raping her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan in either 1995 or 1996. She detailed the alleged attack in a 2019 article, prompting a denial from then-President Trump via the White House spokesperson.

Carroll initially filed a defamation lawsuit in 2019 and a second, separate lawsuit alleging defamation and rape in November 2022. The second suit came after Trump called the lawsuits a “complete con job” and claimed he had “no idea” who Carroll was. He further derided the legal action as a “hoax”.







Monday’s decision relates to the second lawsuit that Carroll filed. In January of this year, Trump was separately ordered to pay $83.3m for the2019 defamation case. Trump is also appealing that verdict.

Because both cases are civil, and not criminal, the jury technically found Trump “liable”, but not guilty of the claims.

The cases have continued despite Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. He is set to begin his second four-year White House term on January 20, after previously serving as president from 2017 to 2021.

Trump was convicted earlier this year in a separate criminal trial in New York for falsifying business records in an attempt to cover up hush money payments to an adult film star. Following his victory, sentencing in that case was put on hold.







Trump’s win helped him to avoid two other federal criminal cases against him, including one connected to hiding and hoarding classified White House documents and another for his alleged role in seeking to overturn the 2020 election results. Under longstanding US Department of Justice policy, a sitting president cannot be prosecuted.

A fourth criminal case in Georgia, related to alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election results in the state, has also been thrown into uncertainty following Trump’s election win.

However, Trump is not protected from all legal actions.

Donald Trump,Trump sentenced in New York hush-money case days before taking office,"Donald Trump has become the first former United States president ever sentenced for a crime.

But the US president-elect avoided penalties for his conviction for falsifying business documents in relation to hush-money payments made to an adult film actress.

Judge Juan Merchan sentenced Trump to an “unconditional discharge” on Friday, a day after theUS Supreme Court rejectedan attempt by Trump’s legal team to delay the sentencing, which took place before the Republican leader’s inauguration on January 20.

The decision means that Trump’s conviction will appear on his permanent record, but he does not face imprisonment, a fine or probation — leaving him unencumbered to enter the White House.

Trump, who previously served as president from 2017 to 2021, wasfound guilty in late Mayon 34 counts of falsifying business documents related to a $130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels, among other things.

The US president-elect has denied any wrongdoing and said he plans to appeal his conviction.

Appearing virtually at Friday’s sentencing hearing, Trump said his criminal trial and conviction had “been a very terrible experience” and insisted he committed no crime.

“It’s been a political witch-hunt,” Trump said before the judge issued his decision. “It was done to damage my reputation so I would lose the election and obviously that didn’t work.”

Prosecutors in the New York case had argued that the hush-money payments aimed to conceal allegations of a sexualrelationship with Danielsthat could have been politically damaging.

Thepayments were madeahead of the 2016 US presidential election, which saw Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the White House.

Trump, who pleaded not guilty in the case, has denied any sexual relationship took place.

Reporting from Washington, DC, on Friday morning, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said prosecutors had argued “it was important that Donald Trump was held responsible”.

“The judge himself said this was a unique and difficult case, but in the end, he decided that the sentence had to be an unconditional discharge,” Fisher said.

Under New York’s penal code, a court can sentence a defendant to an unconditional discharge if it “is of the opinion that no proper purpose would be served by imposing any condition upon the defendant’s release”.

Earlier this week, Trump’s lawyers had asked the Supreme Court todelay the sentencing“to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the Presidency and the operations of the federal government”.

They argued that a ruling last year by the top court grants presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution, and that means some of the evidence should not have been presented in the case.

But a majority of the justices on the Supreme Court said in a decision late on Thursday that the “alleged evidentiary violations” at Trump’s state-court trial “can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal”.

They also said “the burden that sentencing will impose” on Trump’s responsibilities “is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court’s stated intent to impose a sentence of ‘unconditional discharge’ after a brief virtual hearing”.

Now that he has been sentenced, Trump is free to pursue the appeal, a process that could take years and play out while he is serving his second four-year term as president.

“Today’s event was a despicable charade, and now that it is over, we will appeal this Hoax, which has no merit, and restore the trust of Americans in our once great System of Justice,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform after his sentencing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/10/trump-sentenced-in-new-york-hush-money-case-days-before-taking-office
Donald Trump,‘Tearing down’: What drives Trump’s foreign policy?,"Washington, DC –Donald Trump’s world view can be difficult to pin down.

During the first 100 days of his second term, the United States president started a global trade war, targeting allies and foes alike. He also issued decrees to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate and theWorld Health Organization, amongst other international forums.

Trump continued to double down on a series of unconventional foreign policy proposals: taking over thePanama Canal, annexingGreenland, making Canada the 51st US state and “owning” Gaza.

And despite promising to be a “peace” president, Trump has said he intends to take the US annual Pentagon budget to a record $1 trillion.

He has distanced himself from neo-conservative foreign policy and does not position himself as a promoter of human rights or democracy abroad. His “America First” stance and scepticism of NATO align with realist principles, but his impulsiveness and highly personalised diplomacy diverge from traditional realism.

At the same time, he has not called for a full military or diplomatic retreat fromglobal affairs, setting him apart from isolationists.

So what exactly drives Trump’s foreign policy?

Experts say it is primarily fuelled by a dissatisfaction with the current global system, which he sees as unfairly disadvantaging the US with its rules and restrictions. Instead, Trump appears to want Washington to leverage its enormous military and economic power to set the rules to assert global dominance while reducingUS contributionsand commitments to others.

“The Trump doctrine is ‘smash and grab’, take what you want from others and let your allies do the same,” said Josh Ruebner, a lecturer at Georgetown University’s Program on Justice and Peace.







Mathew Burrows, programme lead of the Strategic Foresight Hub at the Stimson Center think tank, said Trump wants US primacy without paying the costs that come with that.

“He’s withdrawing the US from the rest of the world, particularly economically,” Burrows, a veteran of the US Department of State and CIA, told Al Jazeera.

“But at the same time, he somehow believes that the US … will be able to tell other countries to stop fighting, to do whatever the US wants,” he said. “Hegemony just doesn’t work that way.”

Trump appears to believe that threatening and imposing tariffs – andoccasionally violence– is a way of employing US leverage to get world leaders to acquiesce to his demands.

But critics say the US president discounts the power of nationalism in other countries, which prompts them to eventually fight back. Such was the case for Canada.

After Trump imposed tariffs and called for Canada to become the 51st state, this led to a wave of nationalist pride in the northern neighbour and an abrupt shift from theConservative Party to the Liberal Party.

From Canadato China, foreign governments have accused Trump of “bullying” and blackmail.

Some of Trump’s Democratic rivals have rushed to accuse him of abandoning the US global role, but at the same time, the US president has been projecting American strength to pressure other countries.

While not entirely isolationist, his approach marks a significant turn from that of his predecessor.

The late Secretary of StateMadeleine Albrightfamously said in 1998: “We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future.”

That purported power and wisdom, as Albright envisioned, put the US in a position to implementPax Americana– the concept of a peaceful global order led by Washington.

Trump does see the US as proverbially taller than other nations, but perhaps not in the way Albright meant.

“America does not need other countries as much as other countries need us,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this month.

Her statement, however, was to stress that other nations must negotiate with the US to avoidTrump’s tariffs.

In this context, Trump is seeking revenues and jobs – not an international system governed by liberal values in the way that Washington defines them.

However, Burrows said the chief aim of Trump’s foreign policy is to dismantle the existing global order.

“A big part of his world view is really his negative feelings towards the current order, where others appear to be rising,” Burrows said. “And so, a lot of this is just tearing down.”







Much of the system that manages relations between different countries was put in place after World War II, with the US leading the way.

The United Nations and its agencies, the articles of international law, various treaties on the environment, nuclear proliferation and trade, and formal alliances have governed global affairs for decades.

Critics of Washington point out that the US violated and opted out of the system where it saw fit.

For example, the US never joined the Rome Statute that established theInternational Criminal Courtin 1998. It invaded Iraq in 2003 without United Nations Security Council authorisation in an apparent breach of the UN Charter. And it has been providing unconditional support to Israel despite the US ally’s well-documented abuses against Palestinians.

“The United States has done a lot to stand up sort of multilateral institutions – the UN and others – that are based around these ideas,” said Matthew Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy.

“But the United States has always found ways to violate these norms and laws when it when it serves our purposes,” he added, pointing to former US President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza and President George W Bush’s policies after the 9/11 attacks, which included extraordinary rendition,torture, invasion and prolonged occupation.

But for Trump and his administration, there are indications that the global order is not just to be worked around; it needs to go.

“The post-war global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” Trump’s Secretary of StateMarco Rubiotold senators during his confirmation hearing in January.

Trump recently told Time Magazine that the US has been “ripped off” by “almost every country in the world”.

His rhetoric on foreign policy appears to echo his statements about promising to look after “America’s forgotten men and women” who have been mistreated by the “elites” domestically.

While the modern world order has empowered US companies and left the country with immense wealth and military and diplomatic might, Americans do have major issues to complain about.

Globalisation saw the outsourcing of US jobs to countries with less expensive labour. Past interventionist policies – particularly thewars in Iraqand Afghanistan – are largely seen as strategic blunders that produced a generation of veterans with physical and mental injuries.

Geoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a centre-right think tank in Washington, DC, noted that wages have stagnated for many Americans for decades.

“The fact is that the benefits of globalisation were very maldistributed, and some people up at the top made enormous plutocratic sums of money, and very little of that flowed down to the mass of the working class,” Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.

For people who saw their factories closed and felt like they were living in “left-behind areas”, electing Trump was “retribution” against the system, Kabaservice said, adding that Trump’s “America First” approach has pitted the US against the rest of the world.

“America is turning its back on the world,” Kabaservice said. “Trump believes that America can be self-sufficient in all things, but already the falsity of this doctrine is proving true.”







Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy, said Trump’s foreign policy, including his approach to allies, comes from “the politics of grievance”.

“He does believe that the United States – because of its role as world policeman, which he’s not necessarily in love with – has been shouldering a lot of the security burden of the world without getting proper compensation,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.

The US president has been calling on NATO allies to increase their defence spending, while suggesting that Washington should be paid more for stationing troops in allied countries like Germany andSouth Korea.

So how does Trump view the world?

“He’s an aggressive unilateralist, and in many ways, he’s just an old-school imperialist,” Duss said of Trump. “He wants to expandAmerican territory. He wants to extract wealth from other parts of the world … This is a kind of foreign policy approach from an earlier era.”

He noted that Trump’s foreign policy is to act aggressively and unilaterally to achieve what he sees as US interests.

Kabaservice said Trump wants the US to return to an age when it was a manufacturing powerhouse and not too involved in the affairs of the world.

“He likes the idea that maybe the United States is a great power, sort of in a 19th-century model, and it lets the other great powers have their own sphere of influence,” he said.

Kabaservice added that Trump wants the US to have “its own sphere of influence” and to be “expanding in the way that optimistic forward-moving powers are”.

This notion of an America with its own “sphere of influence” appeared to be supported by Rubio when he spoke earlier this year of the inevitability of“multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet”.

Parsi said that Trump is seeking hemispheric hegemony above all, despite his aversion for regime change – hence his emphasis on acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal.

“You’re shifting not from the politics of domination towards restraint; you’re shifting from the politics of global domination to a more limited form of domination,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.

“Focus only on your own hemisphere.”







The US may have already experienced what happens when these views of nostalgia and grievance see real-world implications. Trump’s erratic trade policy rocked the US stock market and sparked threats of counter-levies from Canada to the European Union to China.

Eventually, Trump postponed many of his tariffs, keeping a baseline of 10 percent levies and additional importing fees onChinese goods. Asked why he suspended the measures, the US president acknowledged that it was due to how the tariffs were received. “People were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy,” he said.

Ultimately, Trump’s unilateralism and unpredictability have “broken the world’s trust in significant ways” that will outlast his presidency, Kabaservice told Al Jazeera.

“In the broad span of history, Trump will be seen as the person who committed terrible unforced errors that led to the end of the American century and the beginning of theChinese century,” he said.

During his inauguration speech earlier this year, the US president said his legacy “will be that of a peacemaker and unifier”.

“His actual legacy will be that he has torn down the global system that the US created,” said Burrows, of the Stimson Center.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/29/tearing-down-what-drives-trumps-foreign-policy
Donald Trump,Trump’s inauguration: Key takeaways as Trump sworn in as 47th US president,"Donald Trump has taken theoath of officeto become the 47th president of the United States, returning to the White House four years after he left it in defeat.

In his inaugural speech on Monday, Trump, 78, took an aggressive posture, using his podium in the Capitol Rotunda to blast his predecessor, outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden.

He also framed himself as a victim of government “weaponisation”, taking jabs at what he called a “radical and corrupt establishment”.

“My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” Trump said. “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”

This was Trump’s second presidency, after serving in the White House from 2017 to 2021.

But the Trump who returned to the presidency on Monday was a Trump who appeared more confident than in his first term, as he announced his intention to sign astream of executive actionsfrom his first moments in office.

“ With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It’s all about common sense,” he said, citing a new pro-business energy policy and a crackdown on irregular migration as two of his first actions.

He also pledged to “expand” US borders, warning Panama that he would “take back” the canal the US built there.

Still, while Trump once again painted a portrait of the US as a country on the precipice, he tried to strike a more upbeat posture than in his 2017 inaugural address, which became known as the “American carnage” speech.

“I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success,” Trump said. “A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world. And America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.”

But mere hours before Trump’s inauguration, Biden attempted to scuttle some of Trump’s campaign-trail threats.

Trump had repeatedly pledged retribution against those who criticised him, prompting Biden to take an extraordinary action: He issuedpreemptive pardonsfor those who might be prosecuted under Trump’s presidency.

Biden’s pardon offered protection to three frequent targets of Trump’s ire, as well as members of his own family.

One was DrAnthony Fauci, the immunologist whoclashed with Trumpover the country’s COVID-19 emergency response. Another was GeneralMark Milley, a Trumpappointee-turned-criticwho chaired the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a panel of top military leaders, from 2019 to 2023.

Also shielded under the pardon were members of theHouse Select Committee on the January 6 attack, which investigated the events of January 6, 2021.

On that day, a group of Trump supportersstormed the US Capitolin an apparent effort to stop the certification of Trump’s defeat in 2020.

In itsfinal report, the committee referred Trump for criminal prosecution, accusing him of assisting an insurrection against the government.

Trump has repeatedly threatened members of that committee with imprisonment, particularlyLiz Cheney, its most prominent Republican.

“For what they did, yeah, honestly, they should go to jail,” Trump told the TV programme Meet the Press in December.

Biden noted these threats in his statement on Monday, warning of potential prosecutions.

“Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy,” Biden wrote. “Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.”

However, Biden emphasised that these pardons “should not be mistaken as an acknowledgement that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing”.

At noon Eastern time (17:00 GMT), Biden and three other former US presidents — Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama — piled into the Capitol Rotunda with other dignitaries to witness Trump take his second oath of office.

In opening remarks, Senator Amy Klobuchar reminded the audience that the theme of Monday’s inauguration was “our enduring democracy”.

But when Trump took the podium to deliver his inaugural address, he quickly cast a portrait of the outgoing administration as “corrupt”, without naming Biden outright.

“Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent and unfair weaponisation of the Justice Department and our government will end,” Trump said in the opening minutes of his speech.

While out of the White House from 2021 to 2025, Trump became the first US president to be charged and convicted of felony crimes.

His conviction came in May, after a jury found himguilty of 34 countsof falsifying business documents, related to efforts to conceal hush-money payment to an adult film star during the 2016 election.

But Trump facedthree other criminal indictmentsin addition. They included astate casein Georgia, where prosecutors accused him of participating in a criminal conspiracy to undermine the state’s 2020 election results.

And until recently, Trump faced two federal indictments — one for allegedly seeking tooverturn the 2020 election, and the other for withholdingclassified documentswhile out of office. Both caseswere droppedin November, in accordance with Justice Department policy not to prosecute sitting presidents.

Trump has long denied wrongdoing in all the cases against him, and he has accused Democrats of using the Justice Department for personal “witch hunts”.

In Monday’s speech, he tied the criminal probes to anassassination attempthe faced in July, while campaigning in Butler, Pennsylvania.

“Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history,” Trump said.

“The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one — that, I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.”

Trump’s inaugural speech also sought to make good on promises the Republican delivered on the campaign trail.

His first priority, he said, was to declare anemergency on the southern borderwith Mexico.

“All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,” Trump said.

As part of that push, Trump explained he would send troops to the border “to repel the disastrous invasion of our country”.

He also pledged toreimplementhis 2019 “Remain in Mexico” policy, which required asylum seekers to stay on the other side of the border while waiting for their immigration appointments and court dates.

Critics, however, had challenged the policy as a violation of domestic and international asylum law, pointing out that asylum seekers have the right to cross international borders to flee imminent persecution. They also argued that parts of the Mexican border were unsafe for migrants and asylum seekers to remain in, due to the presence of criminal activity.

Biden attempted to end the policy in February 2021, shortly after taking office, and it has since been wrapped up inlitigation.

Also in Monday’s speech, Trump repeated his false assertion that foreign countries were emptying their prisons and mental health institutions across the US border, and he pledged to designate drug-trafficking cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations”.

Then, he added, he would invoke theAlien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president to detain and deport foreign nationals during times of war, to go after “all foreign gangs and criminal networks”.

“As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,” Trump said.

An estimated 11 million people live in the US without legal authorisation, and human rights advocates fear Trump’s proposed crackdown may extend beyond criminal networks, ultimately fissuring families and communities.

Trump painted a rosy picture of life under his incoming presidency: one in which the US is prosperous and growing.

But in doing so, he used loaded language like “manifest destiny”, a term associated with the westward expansion of colonialism across North America, forcibly displacing Indigenous peoples.

“ The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,” he said.

“And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.”

In the lead-up to his inauguration, Trump has made repeated references to expanding US territory abroad.

In Central America, he has urgedPanamato “return” the Panama Canal, claiming unfair trade practices across the US-built waterway. To the north, he has encouragedCanadato become the US’s “51st state”. And in the case ofGreenland, he hasrefusedto rule out “military or economic coercion” in his push to assimilate the autonomous Danish territory.

Trump reprised several of those issues in his inauguration speech, accusing Panama of treating the US “very badly”.

“We gave it to Panama,” Trump said of the canal. “And we’re taking it back.”

Trump also called for the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the “Gulf of America”, and he said he would revert the name of an Alaskan mountain, currently known by its Indigenous name Denali, to “Mount McKinley”.

In his speech, Trump depicted the US’s colonial era as a time of triumph, arguing that present-day Americans need to return to the spirit of that age.

“The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls,” Trump said.

“Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on earth. No one comes close.”

As part of his depiction of an America in crisis, Trump sketched a vision of the US hampered by censorship, a recurring theme in the conservative sphere in recent years.

“After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America,” Trump said.

But he pivoted from there to attacking efforts to educate about racism and enduring racial divides, through diversity initiatives in schools and businesses. Many conservatives have deemed such programmes “woke” and have called for them to be dismantled.

He also made allusions to his campaign promises to dismantle protections for transgender and nonbinary Americans.

“ I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colour-blind and merit-based,” he said.

“As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.”

Despite the divisive rhetoric, Trump repeatedly described himself as a “unifier” in his speech, ushering in a new age of prosperity.

“My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier,” he said. That spirit will extend beyond the US’s borders, he added.

“ We will be a nation like no other full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.”

Speaking from Capitol Hill, Al Jazeera correspondent Alan Fisher called the speech a “very dark” one.

“This was Donald Trump effectively settling scores,” Fisher said, comparing it to a campaign speech.

Fisher described Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s rival in the 2024 race, as sitting “stony-faced” in the audience, only rising to their feet when the release of Israeli captives in Gaza was mentioned.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/20/key-takeaways-as-donald-trump-is-sworn-in-as-47th-us-president
Donald Trump,Trump rejects taunts that Elon Musk is real power behind US president-elect,"United States President-elect Donald Trump has pushed back on the notion that he has “ceded the presidency” to billionaireElon Musk, who has taken an outsized role in the president-elect’s transition into the White House.

Trump made the comments during a speech in Arizona on Sunday, days after the Tesla and SpaceX owner intervened alongside the president-elect toscuttle a budget billnegotiated in Congress.

The incident was the latest in which Musk has taken an atypically large role in the incoming Trump administration, prompting criticism from Democrats and from within Trump’s own Republican party.

Directly addressing those criticisms for the first time, Trump praised Musk, before adding: “And no, he’s not taking the presidency.”

Trump further called the suggestion that he has “ceded the presidency to Elon Musk” another “hoax” pushed by his political opponents.

In a later quip, Trump noted that there is no risk of Musk officially taking over as president because he would be constitutionally barred from doing so.

“You know why he can’t be [president]?” Trump asked the crowd in Arizona. “He wasn’t born in this country.”







The South African-born Musk – the world’s richest person according to Forbes Magazine – became one of Trump’s biggest supporters in the run-up to the election, endorsing the president-elect in July following an assassination attempt and pumping an estimated $200m into a Political Action Committee (PAC) supporting Trump.

He has since been tapped by Trump to lead a proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with taking a slash-and-burn approach to federal government spending.

The so-called “department” has been billed as an independent advisory panel, not an official government agency, and its purview remains undefined.

Trump’s comments come a day after outgoing US President Joe Bidensigned into law a funding billthat averts a government shutdown.

The previous bill negotiated by members of both parties in Congress was torpedoed days earlier when Trump came out in opposition.

The president-elect’s main contention was that the bill did not raise the debt ceiling – a political fight Trump hoped to avoid before taking office in January.The debt ceilingis the US’s borrowing limit, a cap imposed by Congress on how much money the government can borrow to cover the gap between its revenue and spending.

Musk had also come out in opposition to the deal, which he criticised in a flood of tweets on the X social media platform that he also owns. He pledged to financially support primary challenges to lawmakers who supported the original legislation.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson later told US media that he spoke by phone to both Trump and Musk as a new bill was renegotiated.







The final bill – which funds the US government at the current rate through March 14 – gutted several provisions opposed by Trump and Musk. However, the final version did not raise the debt ceiling amid opposition from a cadre of Republican lawmakers.

Speaking to CNN, Republican lawmaker Rich McCormick said Musk’s intervention showed “he has influence and he’ll put pressure on us to do whatever he thinks the right thing is for him.”

Other Republicans have been more accepting, with Representative Tony Gonzales saying in an interview on CBS that it “feels like Elon Musk is our prime minister”.

Speaking on CNN, Senator Bill Hagerty praised Musk’s role in negotiating the bill, while pushing back on the notion that the billionaire was driving Trump’s decisions.

Beyond the budget deal, Musk’sregular presencealongside Trump before he takes office on January 20 has for weeks caused disquiet among Democrats.

The billionaire was on the call when Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following his election victory. He has also been present for recent meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in New York.







The criticism has been prompted by social media memes showing Trump kowtowing to Musk in various settings.

Following last week’s budget negotiations, several Democrats accused Musk of intervening to serve his own interests.

They pointed to his support for removing a provision in the original bill that could have limited the operations of his businesses in China.

“It is extremely alarming that House Republican leadership, at the urging of an unelected billionaire, scrapped a bipartisan, bicameral negotiated funding deal that included this critical provision to protect American jobs and critical capabilities,” Representative Rosa DeLauro wrote in a letter to congressional leaders on Friday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/22/trump-rejects-taunts-that-elon-musk-is-real-power-behind-us-president-elect
Donald Trump,Supporters throng US capital as Donald Trump sworn in for second term,"Washington, DC –United States PresidentDonald Trumphas been sworn in for a second term at an indoor ceremony at the Capitol, where he was shielded against the wintry gusts of a polar vortex.

But his inauguration still saw supporters descend on Washington, DC, to celebrate.

On Monday, in his second inaugural address, Trump pledged that his legacy would be that of a “peacemaker and unifier”.

But in the same remarks, the US president outlined some of his most divisive policy proposals, including a harsh crackdown on irregular immigration and “taking back” the Panama Canal.

“Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigour and vitality of history’s greatest civilisation,” Trump said. “So as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.”

Trump’s Democratic detractors have long accused him of being a threat to US democracy – if not an outright fascist.

However, there were few protesters in Washington on Monday to reject Trump’s return to the White House, marking a stark contrast with thelarge demonstrationsbefore, during and after his first inauguration.

Protesters may have been deterred by the indoor inauguration or the freezing cold. Others may have felt apathy or a sense of acceptance towards Trump’s return to the White House.

The weather, however, did not keep away the US president’s supporters, who showed up in their Make America Great Again (MAGA) gear and queued over several city blocks to get inside the Capital One Arena.

Trump’s last-minute decision on Friday to move his inauguration indoors left many unable to watch it in person. But the arena was set up as an alternative, with a live broadcast of the event. Plus, Trump promised to make a personal appearance afterwards.

Still, thousands of his supporters were left angling for a spot in the 20,000-seat arena, which boasted less space than the outdoor National Mall park.

Although Trump hasfilled his cabinetwith foreign policy hawks, several of his supporters stressed his pledge to advance global peace.

David Marks, who drove from Orlando, Florida, to attend the inauguration events, praised Trump for using “common sense” instead of relying on bureaucracy in his governing style.

Marks rode a bike featuring a banner with the flags of Israel and Palestine and a peace sign.

“He understands it’s in our interests to have world peace,” he said of Trump.

Marks was not able to make it to the arena, where the inauguration ceremony and the president’s speech were broadcast on jumbo screens.

Thousands of others were left outside in the Arctic cold, even after waiting for hours to enter the building. Many watched the inauguration on their phones instead as they waited in the slow-moving line.

Trump’s inaugural address was marked by jabs at outgoing PresidentJoe Bidenand pledges to aggressively enact his hardline campaign promises.

“The golden age of America begins right now,” Trump said, invoking an oft-repeated phrase from his presidential campaign.

“From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.”

Those hoping to get a seat in the Capital One Arena began lining up before dawn, despite temperatures that hovered at -6 degrees Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit).

Johnny Estrada, a 28-year-old police officer from New Mexico, said he and his friends made a last-minute decision to fly in for the inauguration. He admitted some disappointment about the venue change.

“Unfortunately, it was changed a bit on us, but we’re here,” said Estrada, who wore a red Trump hat with a tuft of fake orange hair poking out.

“The next four years are looking really good. As far as today, I’m just happy to be here.”

He added that he most identified with Trump’s “America First” pledge.

“Personally, I don’t like how we give money to these other countries for their wars. I’m an Army veteran, and the money should be going to our country.”

Chicago resident Shay White also did not make it to the arena, but he played down any dismay in the crowd over the circumstances.

“We’re Americans no matter where we are,” White said. “There’s so much good energy over here.”

His face featured a smear of fake blood, in reference to the blood splatter that stained Trump’s cheek after he survived an assassination attempt in July. White explained that he was confident Trump would help end conflicts globally.

“I think we’re going to have less issues with war. Already, a few days agowhat did Gazaannounce? Gaza announced a ceasefire,” White told Al Jazeera.

Trump sent his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region earlier this month to help finalise theceasefire deal, alongside Biden’s representatives.

Several Israeli media outlets reported that Trump’s team pressured Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to approve the agreement that was announced last week.

While supporters in and around the arena viewed Trump as a strong man who would fight for peace, the president’s critics feared a different outcome for the next four years.

At the Metropolitan AME Church just blocks from the White House, Reverend Al Sharpton’s National Action Network held a rally in honour of Martin Luther King, Jr.

Many attendees found irony in the fact that Trump’s inauguration took place on the national holiday named for the Black civil rights leader.

“We came here to talk about Trump and how to protect people,” said Valerie Adelin of New York City, wearing a fur coat and a face mask advertising Biden’s 2020 presidential campaignas she walked into the church.

“Martin Luther King Jr stood for justice, peace and empowerment,” she added. “We’re celebrating his life, and that’s particularly significant today.”

Inside, 70-year-old Duval Clemmons, who is from New York, condemned Trump’s pledge to pardon his supporters who ransacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an effort to overturn Biden’s election victory.

Trump repeated that pledge on Monday, telling supporters, “You’re going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages”.

Clemmons also pointed out that Trump himself had been found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, related to a hush-money payment he attempted to conceal during the 2016 election.

That conviction in May made Trump the first person in US history to assume the presidency with a criminal record.

“He’s a felon coming in with access to nuclear weapons,” Clemmons said. “He’s a liar, and he’s making us weaker globally.”

“Now he’s talking about pardoning the people who stormed the Capitol, when so many people are still feeling the effects of that.”

One mile north, at Meridian Park, about 200 protesters also gathered to decry Trump’s pledges of mass deportation, his support for Israel and his attacks onreproductive rights.

Rachel, 32, an art historian from Washington, DC, said protesters hoped to send a unified message of “community” despite the various causes they support.

“It shows that our agendas are not siloed. They are intertwined and connected, and there is strength in working across our immediate interests,” said Rachel, who chose to be identified by her first name only.

Still, the protest movement surrounding Trump’s inauguration was relatively quiet compared with when Trump first took office in 2017.

While the Women’s March in 2017 brought an estimated 500,000 people to the US capital, its latest iteration – dubbed the People’s March on Washington – saw far fewer protesters on Saturday, though several thousand still showed up.

Amy Burke, a 55-year-old protester from Tampa, Florida, who had also attended the Women’s March in 2017, acknowledged a general fatigue ahead ofTrump’s second term.

“It’s hard. I can’t tell you how many friends I asked to join me, and they’re just tired, they’re exhausted, they’re disappointed,” she said. “They’re trying to gear up for the next four years.”

Already, Trump has moved ahead with sweeping pledges for changes – enacting some of them within hours of his inauguration.

In his inaugural speech, Trump outlined his executive actions on immigration, including declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border and sending troops there.

He added that he would reinstate his “remain in Mexico” policy, which forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their US immigration hearings, designate Mexican drug cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations” and “eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks”.







In one of the first moves under his administration, US authorities announced thatthe CBP One apphad been shut down, and all appointments made through it cancelled.

CBP One was established in 2020 under Trump’s first presidency, and his successor Bidenexpandedits use, making it a requirement for nearly all asylum seekers arriving at the southern border.

Videos shared on social media showed migrants breaking down in tears after learning that their appointments had been annulled.

Peter Cepeda, a mining industry worker from South Texas, was among the supporters who arrived in Washington, DC, to celebrate Trump’s inauguration.

He said he looked forward to the president increasing border security. A Latino immigrant himself, Cepeda said the main reason migration was a top issue for him was public safety.

“A lot of people are getting in without being vetted,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that he only supports immigration “the right way”.

But numerous studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than US-born citizens.

On Monday, Trump also pledged to take actions to boost the country’s economy, including directing his cabinet members to “defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices”.

He also announced a broad deregulation of the energy industry, throwing his support behind the increased extraction of fossil fuels.

“We will drill, baby, drill,” Trump said, returning to a familiar catchphrase.

All told, Trump’s inaugural address was a relatively subdued event, light on policy and similar to his campaign trail speeches.







For his part, Biden used his final day in office to issue a flurry of preemptive pardons for potential targets of Trump’s vowed retribution.

Those included five pardons for his siblings and their spouses.

There were also pardons for Dr Anthony Fauci, an immunologist who sparred with Trump over his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and General Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who called Trump a “fascist”.

Biden also shielded members of Congress who had probed Trump’s role in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol.

Following the inauguration, Biden left Washington on board Special Air Mission 46, a military aircraft. In his final words to former staff, he said, “We’re leaving office, but we’re not leaving the fight.”

Trump’s presence was almost immediately seen at the White House, as he swiftly issued a presidential proclamation ordering US flags to be raised to full-staff for the day.

They had been lowered for a 30-day mourning period for the late President Jimmy Carter. But Trump objected to flags staying at half-mast for his inauguration.

The flags will be returned to half-staff at the end of the day, per the terms of his proclamation.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/20/supporters-swarm-us-capital-as-donald-trump-sworn-in-for-second-term
Donald Trump,What’s behind Trump’s ban on transgender women in US women’s sports?,"United States President Donald Trump has issued an executive order thatbans transgender girls and womenfrom participating in women’s sports in schools and other educational settings.

The directive, titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports”, is the latest addition to a series of new executive actions that have shone a focus on gender debates within the US.

After signing the order in the White House’s East Room on Wednesday, Trump declared that “the war on women’s sports is over”.

The order instructs the Department of Justice to oversee a ban on transgender girls or women from participating in female-designated school athletics or using women’s locker rooms. If schools fail to adhere to the policy, they could lose federal funding.

The directive hinges on a specific interpretation of Title IX, the US law that forbids sex discrimination in education, which now defines “sex” as the gender someone “was assigned at birth”.

Defending the policy, a White House official told CNN: “If you’re going to have women’s sports, if you’re going to provide opportunities for women, then they have to be equally safe, equally fair, and equally private opportunities, and so that means that you’re going to preserve women’s sports for women.”

The directive also has implications for professional sports. It urges government officials to block transgender women from entering the US for competitions and for the State Department to push the International Olympic Committee to stop allowing trans athletes to take part in its games.

When the Olympics comes to Los Angeles in 2028, the US will use “all of our authority and our ability” to enforce Trump’s order, a White House official said.

Trump repeatedly brought up the issue of transgender athletes throughout the 2024 presidential campaign, pledging to tackle it on his first day in office.

“We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools,” Trump said a day before being sworn in in Washington. “We will keep men out of women’s sports. It’s over.”

The debate over allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports – which polls indicate most Americans oppose – became a lightning rod in the US culture war in the lead-up to the US presidential election last year.

According to a May 2023 Gallup survey of adults in the US, nearly 70 percent of respondents said trans athletes should only be allowed to compete in their own sex categories. In other words, trans women should compete on men’s teams only. This was a rise from 62 percent in 2021.

It’s complicated. While there was no specific national ban on transgender women in women’s sports prior to Trump’s executive order, 27states already have laws, regulations or policiesrestricting transgender students from participating in sportscategories matching their gender identities rather than their biological sex, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank.

However, these laws have frequently been challenged in federal courts, with mixed outcomes. Generally, the courts have ruled that transgender athletes should be allowed to compete, with judgements in their favour in Idaho, West Virgina and Arizona.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the US’s main governing body for college sports, welcomed the clarity provided by Trump’s executive order, saying it set a unified national framework amid “a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions”.

From early on in his 2021-2025 term, former US President Joe Biden was a strong advocate of transgender rights, reversingan orderfrom the 2017-2021 Trump era that had barred transgender people from the military (which Trump has since reinstated).

Then in 2023, Biden’s administration set out to amend Title IX to provide some protections for transgender athletes. Under its proposal, which was viewed as a middle-ground approach to the contentious issue, schools would be prohibited from imposing blanket bans on transgender athletes, but would still have the ability to limit their participation if it could be proven to jeopardise fair competition or safety.

However, as the former president’s term drew to a close, his administration withdrew the proposal, saying it did not have enough time to “regulate on this issue” due to conflicting feedback and drawn-out court cases.







The issue has been hotly debated for years. Studies have shown that transgender women, even after hormone treatment, still have an advantage in strength and speed over women. This is because suppressing testosterone alone may not be enough to compensate for the natural athletic advantage men have over women after undergoing male puberty, which also generally results in higher bone density, larger lung capacity and greater muscle mass.

However, a 2024 study commissioned by the International Olympic Committee found that transgender women may have lower performance in jumping, lung capacity and general cardiovascular fitness than other men.

“Trans women can have disadvantages because their larger frames are now being powered by reduced muscle mass and reduced aerobic capacity, but that’s not as obvious as the advantages of simply being bigger,” Joanna Harper, a sports scientist who is transgender, told the BBC.

“The question isn’t ‘Do trans women have advantages?’ – but instead, ‘Can trans women and women compete against one another in meaningful competition?’ Truthfully, the answer isn’t definitive yet,” she said.

Although relatively few transgender women have competed in women’s sports at elite levels, several high-profile cases have sparked public debate in recent years. One of the most notable was that ofswimmer Lia Thomas, who spent three years on the University of Pennsylvania’s men’s swimming team before transitioning and joining the women’s team, and going on to shatter multiple records.

Another is Canadian cyclist Veronica Ivy, who in 2018 became the first transgender woman to win a world track cycling championship. Ivy criticised the sport’s governing authority for later imposing a ban on transgender women who transitioned after puberty from participating in women’s events, calling the policy “inhumane” and “disgusting”.

Though not self-identifying as transgender, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif was at the centre of a gender row during the last Olympic games. Khelif, who was recorded as female at birth faced a flurry of online backlash, egged on by Trump and several right-wing French politicians, due to previously failing a “gender eligibility test” by a boxing federation. Khelif, who was deemed fully eligible for the Olympics and won a gold medal last year, laterfiled a lawsuitagainst social media platform X for harassment.







The International Olympic Committee revised its policies last year to give individual sports the authority to set participation criteria. At least 10 Olympic sports, including swimming, cycling and boxing, introduced restrictions for transgender athletes for the 2024 games.

The US’s NCAA, for its part, has sport-specific testosterone limits for transgender women. The association has now said it will take steps to align its policy with Trump’s new directive, “subject to further guidance from the administration”.

Their views are divided. Some argue such a ban is necessary to maintain fairness in women’s sports, while others contend it unjustly discriminates against a minority community.

Former British Olympian Sharron Davies, a swimmer who campaigns for women’s sports, claimed that “second-rate male athletes are self-identifying their way onto women’s podiums” and ruining grassroots sport in a foreword to a report by Policy Exchange, a UK conservative think tank, in 2024. Davies is also calling for the United Kingdom’s government to ban biological males from female amateur competitions as well as professional ones.

Riley Gaines, a former college swimmer who is now an advocate for women’s sports, was one of those who attended Trump’s signing ceremony on Wednesday and said she welcomes the ban. She wrote on X: “Things could’ve been so different. Gender insanity was the final straw that brought a lot of moderates to the side of common sense.”

Things could've been so different. Gender insanity was the final straw that brought a lot of moderates to the side of common sense. Specifically, I believe it was the issue of men in women's sports.

I've been living in a state of gratitude everyday since Nov 5th. Praise God.pic.twitter.com/3ByM1n8TUf

— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_)February 5, 2025



Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, however, spoke out against the ban, saying it only served to alienate transgender women.

“Contrary to what the president wants you to believe, trans students do not pose threats to sports, schools or this country, and they deserve the same opportunities as their peers to learn, play and grow up in safe environments,” she said.

They have largely condemned the ban.

GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy group, accused Trump’s administration of disingenuously using the protection of women as an excuse to erode transgender rights.

“Anti-LGBTQ politicians with a record of abusing and silencing women and stripping their health care have zero credibility in any conversation about protecting women and girls,” the group said in a statement.

Athlete Ally, another pro-LGBTQ organisation, said it was saddened that trans youth would “no longer be able to know the joy of playing sports as their full and authentic selves”.

“We’ve known this day was likely to occur for a long time, as this administration continues to pursue simple solutions to complex issues, often resulting in animus towards the most marginalised communities in our country,” the group said in a statement.

Donald Trump,US Election 2024,"United States President-elect Donald Trump has started selecting his cabinet and other senior administration officials after his election victory onNovember 5.

Trump must appoint about 4,000 officials, including the heads of the executive departments that make up his cabinet.

The US cabinet consists of 15 federal agencies, each led by an appointed secretary. Along with the vice president, these officials advise the president and implement policies.

Theseappointmentsrequire Senate confirmation, and typically, these votes occur shortly after the president’s inauguration, which will take place on January 20.

Here’s a list of whom Trump has named or is expected to name:



Trump named Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, making him the first Latino in the role. The 53-year-old Rubio, once a hawk on foreign policy, has shifted some views to align with Trump’s more noninterventionist stance, particularly regarding China, Iran and Cuba.

Trump announced on Tuesday that he has selected 44-year-old Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and military veteran, as his pick for defence secretary. Hegseth, known for opposing “woke” military policies, could fulfil Trump’s promise to remove military leaders he views as promoting progressive ideals, potentially clashing with air force General CQ Brown, whom Hegseth has criticised for supporting “left-wing” positions.

Former US Representative Matt Gaetz, 42, was a controversial choice for attorney general. Hailing from Trump’s adopted state of Florida, Gaetz has been an ardent defender of the president-elect for years, but he has made enemies within the Republican Party by attacking colleagues, notably former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Gaetz was also investigated federally for sex trafficking, but the case eventually concluded in 2023 with no charges brought forward. A separate probe from the House Ethics Committee was set to result in the publication of a report in November, but Gaetz’s resignation from the House after his nomination stalled that process. Facing outcry over the report’s fate, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the attorney general post on November 21.

Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, 59, was nominated after Gaetz withdrew from consideration. A Tampa native, she served as the US state’s first female attorney general from 2011 to 2019. Bondi has been in Trump’s orbit for years, getting a notable speaking spot at the 2016 Republican National Convention as he became the party’s nominee. More recently, Bondi has served as chair of the Center for Litigation at the America First Policy Institute, a think tank set up by former Trump administration staffers to lay the groundwork if he won a second term. She has been a vocal critic of the criminal cases against the ex-president, and she also spread the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election Trump lost to President Biden was stolen.

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, 52, has been selected by Trump to serve as homeland security secretary. Propelled to nationwide prominence for refusing a statewide mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic, Noem is also known for her strong stance on border security. She was the first governor to send National Guard troops to assist Texas at the southern border. Noem will work alongside Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan to enhance US security.

The outgoing governor of North Dakota, Doug Burgum, 68, initially ran in the 2024 presidential election as a Republican rival to President-elect Trump. A billionaire venture capitalist and tech entrepreneur, Burgum invested his own money in the campaign, offering voters gift cards in exchange for small-money donations. But in December 2023, Burgum suspended his bid – and joined Trump’s team as a campaign surrogate. Hailing from an oil-rich state, Burgum is expected to help Trump open public lands to greater drilling, despite opposition from Indigenous groups and environmental advocates.

Fulfilling a campaign promise, Trump named vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, 70, to head the federal agency charged with ensuring the health of Americans. The scion of a political dynasty, Kennedy initially ran in the 2024 presidential race as a Democrat, before switching his party identification to independent. He later endorsed Trump, despite outcry from his family. Kennedy is a controversial pick for this post, having shared conspiracy theories about vaccines, fluoride and other health issues.

A former US representative for the southern state of Georgia, Doug Collins has been out of public office since his term expired in 2021. However, during his time in Congress, Collins made a name for himself as a vocal Trump defender. During the president-elect’s first impeachment hearing in 2019, Collins called the proceedings a “sham”. Collins has served as a chaplain in the US navy and air force, and was deployed for five months during the US war in Iraq.

As CEO of Liberty Energy, Chris Wright is set to champion the controversial oil extraction process known as hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” under the incoming Trump administration. Like Trump, Wright is also a climate change sceptic, posting on the job platform LinkedIn last year that he felt “there is no climate crisis”. Though he has no previous experience in public office, Wright is a mainstay on conservative media outlets like Fox News. In addition to being picked as secretary of energy, Wright is also set to serve on a newly formed Council of National Energy under Trump.

Linda McMahon, 76, the co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment, was chosen to head the Department of Education, an agency Trump has pledged to shutter. A major donor and early supporter of Trump, she headed the Small Business Administration (SBA) director during the Republican’s first term in office, and she co-led his pre-2024 election transition team. McMahon also headed a pro-Trump political action committee supporting Trump’s unsuccessful 2020 re-election bid.

Like Trump himself, Sean Duffy, 53, is a former reality TV star, best known for his appearance on the series The Real World: Boston in the 1990s. Over the next decade, he transitioned into a political career, successfully running to represent Wisconsin’s 7th congressional district from 2011 to 2019. He has since returned to his television roots, hosting a show on Fox Business.

A billionaire who made his fortune on Wall Street, Howard Lutnick, 63, has previously served as a donor and economic adviser to the president-elect. He is currently the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial service firm. Lutnick has also been an outspoken supporter of imposing tariffs on foreign imports, as a means of protecting US economic interests.

A 62-year-old hedge fund manager, Scott Bessent is a long-time Wall Street financier who donated $3m to Trump for his 2024 election campaign. Trump described him as “one of the world’s foremost international investors and geopolitical and economic strategists”. He also said Bessent will help “usher in a new Golden Age for the United States”.

A Republican congresswoman from Oregon, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, 56, recently lost her re-election bid on November 5. But her nomination to Trump’s cabinet is seen as a win for labour rights. She received support from several prominent unions and labour advocates, including the head of the Teamsters, Sean Price. Trump said that she had “worked tirelessly with both Business and Labor to build America’s workforce, and support the hardworking men and women of America”.

A motivational speaker and former athlete in the National Football League (NFL), Scott Turner, 52, previously served in Trump’s first administration, heading the newly formed White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. He has since worked with the America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to setting policy priorities for Trump’s second term. He is the first Black nominee to Trump’s cabinet in his upcoming administration.

Hailing from Glen Rose, Texas, 52-year-old Brooke Rollins is the president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, which helped delineate Republican priorities for a second Trump term. She held several roles in his first administration, including as acting director of the Domestic Policy Council.

Other prominent noncabinet positions named by Trump in recent days include:



After the president and vice president, the cabinet members are the highest-ranking officials in the executive branch of the US government, responsible for advising the president and overseeing their respective federal agencies.

Here are their roles listed in order of succession to the presidency:

Additionally, other positions like the White House chief of staff, director of national intelligence and the UN ambassador are also considered top-level positions even though they are not heads of the executive departments.

President Joe Biden’s outgoing cabinet will now be expected to go through a period of transition in which they will help with the handover of responsibilities, brief incoming officials and ensure continuity of government operations until Trump’s administration takes full control on January 20.

Donald Trump,"James Comey, FBI director, fired by Donald Trump","US PresidentDonald Trumphas abruptly dismissed the director of FBI, saying that James Comey was no longer able to effectively lead the law-enforcement agency.

Comey had beenleading an FBI investigationinto allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and possible collusion with Trump’s campaign.









His dismissal on Tuesday is likely to prompt concerns about the integrity of the inquiry and renew calls for an independent investigation.

Comey had been embroiled in a controversy surrounding his investigation into whether Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while US secretary of state during Barack Obama’s first term as president compromised national security.

“It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law-enforcement mission,” Trump said in a letter to Comey released by the White House.

Trump told Comey in the letter he accepted the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he could no longer provide effective leadership.

Comey’s term was to run through September 2023.

The decision, announced by Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, in a brief appearance before reporters, caught Washington off guard.

“President Trump’s nearly four months in office have been controversial, but this is almost certainly the most controversial decision yet,” said Al Jazeera’s Washington Editor James Bays, calling the move “a political bombshell that will reverberate for a long time.

“It doesn’t end here, because a new FBI director has to be confirmed by the Senate, where the Republicans hold a very slim majority.”

Comey hadsaid in Julythe Clinton email case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared – 11 days before the November 8 election in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee – that he hadreopened the investigationbecause of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.

Clinton said last week that shepartly blamesComey’s decision for her election loss.

The White House released a memo by Rod Rosenstein, deputy attorney general, that provided the administration’s justification for firing Comey.

“I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken,” Rosenstein wrote.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic senator, said firing Comey was “a big mistake”, and questioned the timing of the move.

“We know the FBI has been looking into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians,” he said.

“Were these investigations hitting too close to home for the president?”

In his letter, Trump told Comey: “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.”

There are several Russia investigations ongoing in Congress.

The US House of Representatives’ main investigation has been blocked in recent weeks by squabbles, while the Senate’s parallel probe has been slow moving and equipped with a much smaller staff than previous prominent congressional investigations.









Richard Burr, the Senate Republican leading that investigation, said he was “troubled by the timing and reasoning” behind the firing.

He said he found Comey to a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal “further confuses an already difficult investigation” by his panel.

Matthew Schmidt, an assistant professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven, says Trump’s move gives the impression that his administration has something to hide, as there have been no new revelations about the email inquiry to motivate the timing of the firing.

“Now there’s no way that any report coming out of the FBI that is favourable to the president will be seen as being not tainted,” he told Al Jazeera.

“The only way to save this is to appoint a special prosecutor that is seen as being independent of White House interference.

“The president’s decision to remove the FBI director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee.”

Some Republican politicians supported Trump’s argument that the FBI needs a “fresh start”.

Given the recent controversies surrounding the Director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well.

— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC)May 9, 2017



However, Republican Senator John McCain, a former presidential candidate, said he was “disappointed” by the dismissal of Comey, whom he called “a man of honour and integrity”.

McCain said he had long called for a special congressional committee to investigate Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

Senator Bernie Sanders, Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, said Trump’s decision to fire Comey “raises serious questions about what his administration is hiding”.

“President Trump has repeatedly taken steps to kill inquiries into Russia’s involvement in the US election. It is clear that whomever President Trump hand picks to lead the FBI will not be able to objectively carry out this investigation,” he said in a statement.

Donald Trump,What have Trump administration nominees said about Israel and its wars?,"During the final weeks of the 2024 United States presidential race, former President Donald Trump spoke with sympathy to Arab American and Muslim votersenragedby the country’s support for Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon.

Trump visited Dearborn, Michigan, known as the “capital” of Arab America. And he spoke directly to Lebanese Americans fearing for their families overseas.

“During my Administration, we had peace in the Middle East, and we will have peace again very soon!” Trumpwroteon social media.

“I will fix the problems caused by [Vice President] Kamala Harris and [President] Joe Biden and stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon. I want to see the Middle East return to real peace, a lasting peace.”

But following a thumping victory at the polls, Trump is preparing to return to the White House with a coterie of some of the Republican Party’s most vehemently pro-Israel figures.

While some critics speculated that Trump would move away from a hawkish foreign policy, his picks forkey administration and cabinet positionshave signalled that — whatever changes may come during his second term — a break with Israel is not likely to be among them.

Several of Trump’s nominees not only support continued US military and diplomatic assistance for Israel, but also echo the views and goals of Israeli ultranationalists, who support the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements into Palestinian territory.

Meanwhile, the war in Gaza continues to drive civilian casualties, with at least 43,799 killed since the conflict began in October 2023. A recentreportfrom a United Nations special committee found that Israel’s methods in the Palestinian enclave were “consistent with genocide“.

What have Trump’s high-level picks said about the ongoing conflict in the Middle East? Here are a few of his nominees, in their own words.

A longtime foreign policy hawk,Senator Marco Rubioof Florida has been a strong supporter of Israel throughout his political career. He is in line to be secretary of state, the US’s top diplomat.

February 26, 2016:Rubio made a bid for president in 2016, facing a crowded pool of Republican candidates including Trump. At a Republican primary debate in Houston, Texas, he emphasised that he would “stand firmly on the side of Israel” — and used his position to draw a contrast with Trump.

October 9, 2023:Rubio reacted to the October 7 attacks in southern Israel by calling for an overwhelming military response.

November 2024:Confronted with activists from the antiwar group Code Pink, Rubiorespondedforcefully to questions about whether he would support a ceasefire in Gaza.

August 30, 2024:Rubio sent aletterto the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden criticising the decision to sanction Israeli settlers linked to anti-Palestinian violence in the occupied West Bank.

A US Army veteran who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, Fox News hostPete Hegsethhas been tapped to head the Department of Defense, in one of the country’s highest-ranking military positions. If Hegseth is confirmed, only the president himself would have more authority over the armed forces.

September 14, 2016:In aninterviewwith the Jewish Press, Hegseth explained that he grew up a Baptist and never met a Jewish person until attending college. But he accused higher education of spreading the “seeds of anti-Semitism”.

February 2018:Speakingat the Arutz Sheva Conference in Jerusalem, Hegseth pledged to continue “fighting the fake news about the Arab-Israeli conflict”.

He also appeared to endorse demolishing the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam, to make room for a “Third Temple”, alongstanding goalof Israeli ultranationalists and evangelical Christians.

May 2018:Speaking with his co-hosts on the TV programme Fox & Friends, Hegseth appeared to brush off the Palestinian death toll during theGreat March of Returnprotests. When confronted with the possibility that Israeli snipers had fired on “innocent people”, including children, Hegseth shrugged and said, “Meh.”

A former Arkansas governor who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2008 and 2016,Mike Huckabeeis an evangelical Christian and strong supporter of “Greater Israel”, a term often used to describe the proposed Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory.

Early 2008:At a campaign stop during his first bid for the presidency, Huckabee argued that being Palestinian was a made-up identity.

May 31, 2015:Speakingat an Israel Day concert, Huckabee reflected on his first trip to Israel in 1973. He proceeded to say that Israel had no “better friend in the United States” than him and refuted Palestinian claims to Jerusalem.

August 18, 2015:During anews conferenceat the illegal Israeli settlement of Shiloh, Huckabee endorsed a vision of Israel that included the occupied West Bank, calling the area by the biblical name “Judea and Samaria”. He also denounced a deal to contain Iran’s nuclear programme.

February 29, 2024:Huckabeetoldthe International Fellowship of Christians and Jews that he was overwhelmed with emotion after theOctober 7 attackson southern Israel. He also described Israel’s illegal settlements in the West Bank as the fulfilment of biblical prophecy.

A congresswoman from New York, Stefanik went viral last year duringcongressional hearingsabout anti-Semitism on college campuses: Her blunt questioning of several university leaders helped precipitate several resignations.

Critics say it also contributed to harsh crackdowns on pro-Palestine student demonstrators, as Stefanik conflated protest slogans like “From the River to the Sea” with calls for anti-Semitic genocide.

May 19, 2024:Stefaniktravelledto the Israeli Knesset to deliver an address in which she described Israel’s war on Gaza as a moral crusade. She also called for the withdrawal of US funds from UNRWA, theUN agency for Palestinian refugees.

September 23, 2024:Following a UN General Assembly vote calling on Israel to end its unlawful occupation of Palestinian territory, Stefanik released astatementcondemning the proceedings.

A member of the House of Representatives and a former Green Beret, Representative Mike Waltz of Florida has expressed firm support for Israel. He currently serves on the House Armed Services Committee. He previously chided the Biden administration for providing Israel with insufficient support.

August 16, 2019:In anappearanceon Fox News, Waltz expressed his support for Israel’s decision to bar his congressional colleagues Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar from entering the country over their support for the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement.

Tlaib, a Palestinian American, was later offered a “humanitarian” visit, which she rejected.

August 17, 2024:In anotherinterviewwith Fox News, Waltz approvingly noted that, when Trump was in office, the Iranian economy was “broke” and was “in shambles” due to crushing sanctions.

He also credited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “strong actions” with containing the threat represented by Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Donald Trump,US Election 2024,"Lamu, Kenya –As the results of the United States presidential election came in on Wednesday, showing that former President Donald Trump had won, relief took hold more than 11,000 kilometres (7,000 miles) away, in Uganda’s capital Kampala.

“Thesanctionsare gone,” the East African country’s parliamentary speaker, Anitah Among, told parliament, hinting at her expectation of improved ties with the US under Trump. The speaker is one of a series of Ugandan officials who have beenbarred from entering the USin recent years because of allegations of human rights violations against them.









But while some African governments that have faced allegations of authoritarianism in recent years might find reason to celebrate, sanctions are not the only thing that might go under Trump, warn analysts: US aid might too.

Four days after Trump’s re-election, Africa is grappling with the prospects of what his second term could mean for the continent.

His win on Tuesday over Vice President Kamala Harris drew immediate congratulations from African leaders, with Egypt’s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Ethiopia’s Abiy Ahmed, Nigeria’s Bola Tinubu, and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa among those to quickly reach out to Trump.

Yet, many experts believe Trump’s foreign policy will prioritise transactional relationships and shift away from multilateral partnerships, with aid, trade, and climate agreements now uncertain. Trump’s focus, they warn, could be limited to how Africa fits within his broader geopolitical objectives, especially concerning his rivalry with China. Those who fall in line will be favoured, others pressured to conform – that, say analysts, was Trump’s track record during his first stint in power, between 2017 and 2021.

“He is a dealer. He transacts based on what he can get,” said Christopher Isike, professor of African studies and international relations at the University of Pretoria.

Patrick Bond, professor and political sociologist at the University of Johannesburg, said he expected leaders who have faced scrutiny over their human rights records – such as Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda’s Paul Kagame – to try to curry favour with Trump. Both Museveni and Kagame have long been important US allies, and their supporters have pushed back against more recent attacks on their human rights records, insisting that the leaders remain widely popular in their countries.

Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who has also faced US sanctions, also praised Trump’s victory, describing him as a leader who “speaks for the people”.

Samuel Oyewole, a Nigerian political science lecturer, remarked that Trump is unlikely to let human rights and democratic norms drive his relationship with African leaders.

“The emphasis on human rights and democracy, which was emphasised by Biden, may not be prioritised for strategic interest under Trump,” Oyewole told Al Jazeera.

Trump may actually target countries deemed to be acting against US interests, warned Oyewole.

This could strain relationships with democracies like South Africa, which hascriticised US support for Israeland maintainsstrong ties with Russiaand China. South Africa, which – despite recent tensions with Washington, counts on the US as a key economic and strategic partner – will not want that.

“I look forward to continuing the close and mutually beneficial partnership between our two nations across all domains of our cooperation,” Ramaphosa wrote in his congratulatory message to Trump on X.

Trump’s return to office also places the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in jeopardy, with the current agreement set to expire next September, say analysts.

The AGOA, first enacted in 2000, provides African countries with duty-free access to the US market for specific products. Trump, known for his aversion to multilateral agreements, may view AGOA as leverage to negotiate more advantageous bilateral deals, risking the existing framework, warn experts.

“Trump will use every instrument at his disposal,including AGOA, to strong-arm African governments,” said Isike.

In December 2022, Biden’s administration pledged $55bn over three years to African nations, but this investment could be at risk as Trump reorients US foreign aid towards his strategic priorities.

Bond warned that the AGOA could be “up for grabs” as Trump leverages these issues in negotiations.

Oyewole suggested Trump would also deploy aid strategically, conditioned on the continent’s alignment with his interests – just as the incoming president has threatened to do with other parts of the world, such as in Ukraine. “We cannot consider Trump to be Father Christmas,” he said.

US aid to Africa, currently about $8bn annually, could face cuts under Trump, especially programmes like PEPFAR (the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which forms a significant part of US aid. Vaccine programmes, HIV/AIDS programmes, and reproductive health programmes are among those at risk.

Further, analysts said Trump’s climate scepticism poses a major concern for the continent.

He previously withdrew the US from the Paris Climate Agreement, and his re-election raises fears of a repeat exit.

Bond emphasised the potential fallout, stating that Trump’s approach would be “catastrophic” for Africa, which disproportionately bears climate change’s consequences despite minimally contributing to global emissions.

By pulling the US out of climate agreements, Trump would not only curtail Africa’s access to international climate funds – needed to tackle everything from water scarcity to food insecurity – but also embolden polluting industries globally, amplifying Africa’s climate vulnerability, Bond said.

Trump’s victory could also have other geopolitical consequences for Africa.

The Biden administration had supported two permanent seats for Africa on the United Nations Security Council.

However, Oyewole pointed out that with Trump’s disregard for multilateral institutions, Africa’s longstanding aspiration for UN Security Council reforms may face new obstacles.

Trump’s rivalry with China also complicates Africa’s position, givenChina’s deep investmentin the continent. Analysts expect Trump to pressure African nations to distance themselves from Beijing, creating difficult choices for countries reliant on Chinese infrastructure funding and trade.

Yet, that pressure could backfire: Experts argue that Trump’s detachment from Africa could spur the continent to seek alternative partnerships.

Isike, the professor, suggested that Trump’s disregard might inadvertently encourage African countries to possibly foster stronger intra-continental trade and deeper relationships with nations in Asia and the Middle East.

“If Africa wants to continue on handouts and aid from the US, then it [Trump’s election] is catastrophic,” Isike said. “But maybe it is a good thing for Africa so that we can look elsewhere in terms of our trade partners and alliances.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/9/with-trump-win-africa-braces-for-aid-cuts-uncertainty
Donald Trump,Donald Trump threatens opponents with jail in Justice Department speech,"“This is a storied hall, if there ever was one.”

That is how President Donald Trump opened his remarks to the United States Department of Justice, before he launched into a speech that denounced judges, prosecutors and members of his predecessor’s government as corrupt.

It was an extraordinary moment that hinted at potential legal action against political rivals.

Trump went on to argue that the 2024 election had granted him a mandate to investigate those he felt had committed “abuses” under the presidency of former President Joe Biden.

“I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred,” Trump said. “ The American people have given us a mandate, and really, just a far-reaching investigation is what they are demanding into the corruption of our system.”

Critics have long feared that Trump would seek retribution against his political rivals if he returned to power.

While on the campaign trail in 2024, he repeatedly referred to Democrats as “the enemy from within”, calling them “evil” and more dangerous than the threats posed by China and Russia. He also threatened critics, like Republican Liz Cheney, with jail and said he would appoint a special prosecutor to go after Biden.

But Friday’s speech to the Justice Department was a platform for Trump to renew those threats — and continue to spread false claims that cast doubt on his defeat to Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

“I think it was the most humiliating time in the history of our country,” Trump said of Biden’s term. “What a difference a rigged and crooked election had on our country. When you think about it, the people who did this to us should go to jail. They should go to jail.”

Trump even took aim at prosecutors who worked in the Justice Department, particularly those who participated in criminal investigations against him.

Since taking office for a second term on January 20, the president has led a campaign against what he considers “Biden bureaucrats“, though critics point out that many are nonpartisan civil service members.

Among the thousands of federal employees terminated in the last two months were career prosecutors who participated in the two federal probes into Trump’s behaviour: one for alleged mishandling ofclassified documents, and the other for attempting tosubvert the 2020 election.

Both cases were ultimatelydroppedafter Trump won re-election on November 5. The Justice Departmenthas a policyof not prosecuting sitting presidents.

But while career prosecutors are tasked with serving whichever president is in office, Trump has sought to ensure their removal.

He has also accused the Biden administration of “weaponising” the Justice Department in an effort to derail his re-election campaign.

“As we begin a proud new chapter in the chronicles of American justice, this really is something we’re turning the page on: four long years of corruption, weaponisation and surrender to violent criminals,” Trump said on Friday.

“ But first, we must be honest about the lies and abuses that have occurred within these walls.  Unfortunately, in recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated the trust and goodwill built up over generations. They weaponised the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people.”

Trump touted thefiring of Justice Department prosecutorsfrom the stage, describing them as “Marxist”, though he did acknowledge he may have fired some loyal public servants.

“Last month, I fired all the radical left pro-crime US attorneys appointed by Joe Biden. There were so many that were bad, and I know there were some that were probably very good. But there were so many that were so bad and so evil, so corrupt,” he said.

His speech appeared to signal more firings to come, as Trump continues his campaign against officials associated with Biden.

“We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose and very much expose their egregious crimes and severe misconduct of which was levels — you’ve never seen anything like it,” Trump said.

“It’s going to be legendary. It’s going to also be legendary for the people that are able to seek it out and bring justice.”

Before his election, Trump faced a total  offour criminal indictments: the two federal cases, plus astate-level case in Georgiaabout alleged election interference andanother in New Yorkfor falsifying business records.

That case pertained to alleged efforts to cover up a hush-money payment to an adult film actress, Stormy Daniels, who claimed they had an affair.

While Trump denied any sexual relationship with Daniels and refuted the allegations of wrongdoing, he was neverthelessfound guilty of 34 felony countsin the New York case.

In the weeks before his January inauguration, he wassentencedto an unconditional discharge, which did not involve any punishment.

“The case against me was bull****,” Trump said bluntly at one point on Friday.

He was thefirst president— past or present — to face criminal charges, much less be convicted.

Trump re-litigated those cases, however, in front of the Justice Department audience on Friday and even issued vague threats to journalists for their coverage of the cases. He accused members of the media of attempting to illegally sway the judges presiding over his criminal cases.

“They take tremendous abuse in The New York Times and The Washington Post,” Trump said of the judges.

“They take such abuse. And honestly, very simply, they’re afraid of bad publicity. They don’t want bad publicity, and it’s truly interference in my opinion. And it should be illegal, and it probably is illegal in some form.”

He did reserve praise, however, for federal JudgeAileen Cannon, who represents the southern district of Florida.

“ She was the absolute model of what a judge should be,” Trump said.

Cannon, a Trump appointee, oversaw the federal case alleging that Trump illegally withheld more than 340 classified documents after his first term, even after receiving a subpoena to return them.

In aleaked audio recordingfrom 2021, Trump appeared to acknowledge that the documents were not declassified or approved for release. “See, as president I could have declassified it,” Trump said in the recording. “Now I can’t, but this is still a secret.”

The documentswere seizedby the federal government during a search ofTrump’s Mar-a-Lago resortin Florida, but since returning to office, Trump has had the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) return the documents to his personal residence there.

Cannon was criticised for attempting todismiss the classified documents casein July, on the basis that appointing a special counsel was not constitutional.

For decades, US attorneys general have appointed special counsels to avoid conflicts of interest: While the US attorney general is a political appointee, the special counsel typically comes from outside the government and is given permission to make decisions independently.

Cannon’s decision was largely seen as abreak with precedent, but Trump praised it as an act of bravery on Friday.

“We had an amazing judge in Florida, and her name is Aileen Cannon, and I didn’t know her. I still don’t know her. I don’t believe I ever spoke to her even during the trial, but I did appoint her federal judge,” he said.

“And these fake lawyers, these horrible human beings were hitting her so hard, public relations-wise. They were playing the ref. I don’t think it’s legal.”

It was unclear whether Trump was referring to government lawyers or legal experts weighing in on the case. But he did once again attack the media, accusing journalists of placing pressure on judges like Cannon.

“What do you do to get rid of it? You convict Trump,” the president said of the pressure.

“All you have to do is be really tough on him and ultimately convict him. And they leave you alone. It’s totally illegal what they do. I just hope you can all watch for it. But it’s totally illegal, and it was so unfair what they were doing to her, but they do it all the time with judges.”

Trump ended by recalling the words of English philosopher John Locke: “Wherever law ends, tyranny begins”. Those words are inscribed on the limestone walls of the Justice Department.

“ You can’t go after your political opponent,” Trump said, as he closed his speech.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/14/in-justice-department-speech-donald-trump-threatens-opponents-with-jail
Donald Trump,US Congress certifies Donald Trump’s victory in 2024 presidential election,"The United States Congress has certified Donald Trump’s victory in November’spresidential election, clearing a final hurdle for his return to the White House later this month.

Monday’s ceremony in Congress officially validated the 2024 Electoral College results.

Overseen by Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s main rival in the election, the event passed quickly and with little fanfare.

“Today was obviously a very important day,” Harris, who also serves as the president of the Senate, said in remarks afterwards.

“It was about what should be the norm and what the American people should be able to take for granted, which is that one of the most important pillars of our democracy is that there will be a peaceful transfer of power.”







The largely procedural affair marked a stark contrast with the last time Congress convened to certify Electoral College votes, onJanuary 6, 2021.

During that ceremony, thousands of Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol in an effort to overturn then-President Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election.

Lawmakers were forced to evacuate as doors were smashed, police officers were attacked and one protester was shot to death while trying to enter a chamber through a broken window.

The attack took place after Trump held a rally nearby on the Ellipse, a park south of the White House, where he reiterated false claims that the election had been stolen through massive fraud.

Critics roundly condemned the attack as an assault on democracy, and the US Department of Justice has since charged1,583 participantswith federal crimes.

As of Monday, approximately 1,009 have pleaded guilty, with 327 offering guilty pleas to felony charges.

Trump himself faced two criminal indictments for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election results: A federal case in Washington, DC, was recently dismissed, while a state-level case in Georgia is stalled but ongoing.

Nevertheless, four years later, Trump is set to return to power on the heels of his most successful presidential campaign to date.

In November, Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris’s 226 and became the first Republican candidate to win thepopular votesince 2004.







Trump’s Republican Party will also take control of Congress afterwinning majoritiesin both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Many in the party have since embraced the Republican leader’s false claims about the 2020 election.

“Congress certifies our great election victory today – a big moment in history. MAGA!” Trump wrote on his platform Truth Social on Monday, using an acronym for his slogan, “Make America Great Again”.

Harris, meanwhile, urged respect for the tenets of US democracy. She cited Monday’s peaceful certification as an example of the right way forward.

“I do believe very strongly that America’s democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it,” she said. “Otherwise it is very fragile, and it will not be able to withstand moments of crisis.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/6/us-congress-certifies-donald-trumps-victory-in-2024-presidential-election
Donald Trump,"Trump says ready to use military, national emergency for mass deportations","United States President-elect Donald Trump has confirmed he is “prepared” to declare a national emergency and use military assets to fulfil his2024 election campaignpromise to carry out mass deportations.

Trump made the announcement on Monday in a short post on his Truth Social platform in response to a post by Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch.

Fitton had written on November 8 that reports showed the incoming Trump administration was “prepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets” in its “mass deportation” push.

Trump replied: “True!!!”

The statement is the firmest message yet on how Trump plans to fulfil his campaign promise to conduct the “largest deportation operation” in US history.

The effort has spurred condemnation from rights advocates and raised questions about feasibility and the limits of Trump’s power as president to remove millions of undocumented immigrants from the country.

The Republican president-elect is alsoall but assuredto face a mountain of legal challenges however he proceeds.







Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said on Monday that under US law, presidents may declare a national emergency and exert emergency powers only in specific situations.

“And ‘use the military for deportations’ isn’t one of those specific things,” Reichlin-Melnick wrote on social media in response to Trump’s remarks.

While Trump has been making the deportation pledge for months as he zeroed in on the issue of immigration during his successful re-election campaign, he has offered few details on how he intends to carry out his plans once he assumes office in January.

An estimated 11 million to 13 million undocumented residents live in the US, and immigration and human rights groups have long warned of the humanitarian fallout of a mass deportation effort.

They have said such a policy would likely require an enormous and costly increase in enforcement and detention capacities.

An analysis by the American Immigration Council found that scaling up deportations to one million people a year – about four times the current rate – would cost $967.9bn over a decade.

Stephen Miller, Trump’s incoming deputy chief of staff for policy and longtime adviser onhardline immigration policies, has previously floated the idea of “deputising” the US National Guard, a branch of the military, to carry out large-scale raids and detentions.

Tom Homan, the former head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) who has since been tapped to be Trump’s new “border czar”, recently told the CBS TV programme 60 Minutes that the administration would use “targeted enforcement”.

Homan said in the interview at the end of October that the emphasis would be on work sites and “public safety threats and national security threats”.







To avoid family separations, Holman added: “Families can be deported together.”

Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Trump regularly promised to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 – a law that allows presidents to deport citizens of an “enemy nation” without the typical proceedings – when speaking about his deportation plans.

Butlegal experts have saidhe does not have the authority to use the law for mass deportations.

On Monday, Reichlin-Melnick noted that Trump declared a national emergency in 2019 during his first term as president to unlock military funding for a border wall.

He said the president-elect may be planning to use a similar manoeuvre to unlock military funds for deportation enforcement but cautioned that Trump’s remarks should be taken with a grain of salt.

“My lesson from the first time around is that we absolutely cannot take things that the Trumpworld people say as gospel, given their total lack of specifics and total willingness to make grandiose pronouncements that are aimed at triggering the libs [liberals] and making headlines.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/18/trump-says-ready-to-use-military-national-emergency-for-mass-deportations
Donald Trump,Seven takeaways from Donald Trump’s speech to US Congress,"In a lengthy speech before both houses of the United States Congress, PresidentDonald Trumpclaimed that his return to office marked the “most successful era in the history of our country”.

Addressing the House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday, Trump said his administration had “accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four years or eight years”.

“And we are just getting started,” he said.

His remarks touched on many familiar themes: calls for a massive crackdown on undocumented immigrants, whom he attacked as criminals and rapists, praise of “beautiful” tariffs that Trump says will bring balance to UStrade relations, and attacks on transgender people and diversity initiatives.

Here are a few of the main takeaways from Trump’s address, which drew loud cheers from supportive Republicans and protests from some Democrats, pointing to the deep political divisions in the country.

Here are the key takeaways from his speech.







Touting the work of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Trump rattled off a list of statistics purporting to show cases of government waste and fraud.

Many of his administration’s most ambitious claims about unearthingwasteful projectshave been quietly rolled back or debunked later on, but Trump used a series of data points and projects to paint a picture of a federal bureaucracy fixated on diversity initiatives and misguided projects in foreign nations.

Wasteful spending in agencies more aligned with Trump’s political priorities, such as immigration enforcement and the massive US military, has largely evaded similar scrutiny.

As he has frequently done in the past, Trump leaned into rhetoric that portrays immigrants as vectors for crime, disease and disorder, as he pushed Congress for a massive spending package that will help facilitate hismass deportationcampaign.

On several occasions, he addressed guests in the audience — family members of several people killed by immigrants in the US without authorisation — to portray a country under siege by dangerous foreigners, although immigrants, undocumented and otherwise, commit violent crimes at a lower rate than native-born people in the US.

Trump promised to end a series of wars and conflicts around the world during his time on the campaign trail, and his first few weeks in office have seen him upend longstanding partnerships, injecting tension into ties with Europe, neighbours Canada and Mexico, and Ukraine.

But on Tuesday night, he touched on events inUkraineand the Middle East relatively briefly.

After a fiery exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House last week that shocked European allies, Trump said he wanted to see the war brought to an end and that Zelenskyy had sent him a letter underscoring his desire for peace.

On Israel and Gaza, Trump praised the Abraham Accords — a series of agreements where Arab countries normalised ties with Israel, often in return for generous concessions or aid packages from the US — and said he hoped to secure further agreements.

He said he had helped secure the release of US citizens held captive by Hamas in Gaza, but the suffering and futures of millions of Palestinians who have returned home to neighbourhoodsturned to rubbleby Israel’s devastating bombing campaign were not mentioned.

Trump, however, said he hoped to build an Israel-style missile defence shield over the US and repeated his desire to take control of Greenland and the Panama Canal.

While the early minutes of Trump’s speech were met with a chorus of boos from Democratic members of Congress and the expulsion of Democratic Representative Al Green, the opposition’s response was mostly tepid.

Most Democrat members remained seated for the duration of the speech, declining to stand and applaud and sometimes holding up placards calling Trump’s statements false or reading “Musk steals”.

But a sense remains that the Democrats, still stinging fromtheir lossin the 2024 election, have yet to coalesce around a message that could take the fight to Trump.

In a social media post, the conservative commentator Laura Ingraham quipped that Democrats holding signs while sitting down looked like they were “bidding at an auction”.

One of Trump’s most longstanding political beliefs is that the US has been taken advantage of in its economic relations with other countries, and he has promised to usetariffsto bring “balance” to foreign trade and bend countries to his will on a series of other issues.

In his speech on Tuesday, Trump doubled down on his faith in what he previously called “the most beautiful word in the English language: tariff”. This, even as new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China that came into effect on Tuesday, attracted retaliatory measures, drawing the US deeper into trade wars with neighbours and rivals alike.

“Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them,” Trump said. He sought to ease concerns about price increases as a result of tariffs, saying, “There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.”

Trump promised to bring manufacturing operations for everything from cars to ships to semiconductors to the US through the use of tariffs.

“If you don’t make your product in America … you will pay a tariff and, in some cases, a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it’s our turn to start using them against those other countries,” Trump said.

Trump said one of his top priorities was to fix the economy and help working families. He promised to cut costs on eggs and energy by reorganising the federal government, blaming former President Joe Biden for the problem.

“Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg prices [are] out of control, and we’re working hard to get it back down,” Trump said.

Trump’s Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told The Wall Street Journal in late February that the administration was planning to invest $1bn in trying to control egg prices — using a combination of payouts to struggling farmers, increased egg imports, and no scientific research into avian flu to better tackle its effects.

Egg prices started soaring amid the mass culling of chickens in recent years because of avian flu. That practice has continued under Trump, and egg prices have continued to rise under the current administration.

In late February, eggs on average cost $4.95 a dozen — double what they cost a year ago under Biden, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics.

Trump announced that the US has captured “the top terrorist responsible” for the suicide bombing that killed 13 soldiers during the 2021 withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan.

“Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity,” Trump said during his address. “And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.”

Donald Trump,"As Trump vows ‘no exceptions’ on tariffs, US allies hope to change his mind","When United States President Donald Trump announced his latesttariffs on steel and aluminiumthis week, he insisted there would be “no exemptions, no exceptions”.

Washington’s closest allies in the Asia Pacific are hoping they will be able to change the mercurial US president’s mind.

Japan and Australia, US treaty allies with export-reliant economies, have both confirmed they are seeking exemptions from Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, while South Korea, also a US treaty ally, has announced it is seeking high-level talks on the issue.

“We will take necessary measures, including lobbying the United States for an exemption, while closely monitoring any possible impact on the Japanese economy,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who met Trump in Washington last week, told parliament on Wednesday.

Since both Japan and South Korea have large trade surpluses with the US, their efforts to sway Trump are likely to include commitments to increase US imports.

The US trade deficit with Japan and South Korea stood at about $68bn and $66bn, respectively, in 2024, mostly as a result of auto exports.

Tokyo is also likely to point to “its technical advantage, which is desperately needed by the US to take a lead in new strategic industries”, said Shigeto Nagai, the Asia head of Oxford Economics.

“Japan enjoys a large trade surplus with the US for machineries, which gives incentive to the US to impose tariffs,” Nagai told Al Jazeera.

“At the same time, the technological advantage of Japanese machineries such as semiconductor equipment and materials will make it difficult to quickly find substitutes.”







After theirtalks at the White House on Friday, Trump and Ishiba released a joint statement acknowledging the Republican’s agenda of boosting domestic industry, including a pledge to strengthen energy security by “unleashing the United States’ affordable and reliable energy and natural resources”.

At the same time, Ishiba impressed upon Trump that Japan has been the largest foreign investor in the US for the past five years and announced plans for $1 trillion in further investments, including in artificial intelligence.

“My sense is that this [tariff exemptions] remains negotiable,” Ryota Abe, an economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), told Al Jazeera.

“The adverse impacts on the US economy would not be small should the relationship between the two seriously be damaged. And this would not be the best choice even for the US.”

Although the contours of his second administration’s policy priorities are still unfolding, Trump has taken his reputation for being fond of a deal with him from his first term.

Despite insisting thathis tariffs would apply to all countries,Trump almost immediately left the door open to an exception for Australia, saying he would give “great consideration” to an exemption.

“We have a surplus with Australia, one of the few,” Trump said.

Trump’s senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, poured cold water on those hopes the following day, claiming that Australia was “killing” the US aluminium market.

Australia’s aluminium exports surged after Trump first entered office in 2016, peaking at about 269,000 tonnes in 2019.

Exports have fluctuated considerably since then, coming in at 83,000 tonnes in 2024, down from 210,000 the previous year.

“Overall, the second Trump administration is acting both more ruthlessly and chaotically than the first, so allies like Japan – and Australia, and NATO/EU [European Union] allies – will continue to confront a highly volatile and difficult diplomatic situation, which will require extremely dextrous leadership,” Craig Mark, an adjunct lecturer in economics at Hosei University in Tokyo, told Al Jazeera.







During his first term, Trump did not adopt a uniform approach to granting reprieves to friendly countries and allies.

In 2018, his administration exempted Australia from steel and aluminium tariffs and granted South Korea a duty-free steel quota of up to 2.63 million tonnes.

But his administration did not extend such relief to Japan.

The administration of former US President Joe Biden eased the tariffs on Japanese steel in 2022, agreeing to allow 1.25 million metric tonnes of steel to enter the US each year duty-free while keeping tariffs on aluminium in place.

“The experience of the first Trump administration shows how Japan could find itself the target of US tariffs yet again, despite all its diplomatic efforts,” said Mark, the Hosei University professor, pointing out that former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe went to “great lengths to build a close personal relationship with Trump”.

While Trump has a “much more expansive view of his remit”, compared with his first term, and views tariffs as a “genuinely valuable tool that can be used to solve a myriad of problems”, the overriding feature of his administration is uncertainty, said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore.

Elms said she was not certain Trump himself would be able to provide answers about his policy direction or goals, “or if he did so, that his answers now would be the same as what he might say in another hour or day or week”.

“As he’s the one driving trade policy  – for the moment, at least – this lack of clarity matters,” Elms told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/13/as-trump-imposes-no-exceptions-tariffs-asian-allies-hope-for-a-reprieve
Donald Trump,Trump says no right of return for Palestinians under his Gaza proposal,"Washington, DC –United States PresidentDonald Trumphas confirmed that his proposal for mass displacement in Gaza does not include a right of return for Palestinians in the enclave.

In an interview with Fox News, partially aired on Monday, Trump also reiterated his push to “own” Gaza.

Asked whether Palestinians would be allowed to return to their territory under his plan, Trump said, “No, they wouldn’t.”

The US president’s plan to empty Gaza of its population has been forcefully rejected across the Middle East – including by Egypt and Jordan, the main countries that Trump says he wants to host displaced Palestinians.

Rights groups have also condemned the push, saying that it would amount toethnic cleansing.

Trump’s assertion that he is seeking thepermanent displacementof people in Gaza appears to contradict recent comments by his aides who said that the enclave’s residents would be able to return after the area is rebuilt.







Last week, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said people in Gaza would be “temporarily relocated”.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said that the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza would be in the “interim”, and residents would be able to “move back in” after reconstruction.

In His Fox News interview, Trump suggested that the US would leverage its aid to Jordan and Egypt to get the two countries to take in displaced Palestinians.

“I think I could make a deal with Jordan. I think I could make a deal with Egypt. You know, we give them billions and billions of dollars a year,” the US president said.

He added that Palestinians would live in “beautiful communities”away from Gaza. “In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future,” he said.

The plan for the US to take over Gaza has raised eyebrows across the world. Washington has no legal claim to the territory, and the United Nations charter prohibits the acquisition of land by force.

According to the Health Ministry in Gaza, Israel’s US-backed war on the enclave has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians. The Gaza Government Media Office puts the death tollat more than 61,700, including thousands of missing people who are presumed dead.

The Israeli offensive has turned much of Gaza into rubble. But the territory’s residents have pledged to remain steadfast in their land.







Local authorities have beenpleading for tentsand mobile homes to shelter people until reconstruction begins, accusing Israel of hindering the aid in violation of the ceasefire agreement.

Last week, Amnesty International warned that systemic efforts to expel Palestinians in Gaza could constitute a crime against humanity.

“Amnesty International also warns against the misuse of desperately needed humanitarian aid and reconstruction as a bargaining chip or as a means to coerce Palestinians in Gaza into leaving,” the group’s chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement.

“No state is entitled to treat a protected population living under occupation as pawns in a geopolitical chess game.”

Donald Trump,Donald Trump renews threats against Harvard University’s tax exempt status,"United States President Donald Trump has renewed his threat to strip Harvard University of its tax exempt status, a move that could cost the Ivy League institution billions of dollars if implemented.

“We are going to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what they deserve!” Trump wrote on Friday, in aposton his social media platform Truth Social.

The statement is the latest threat in acontinuing feudbetween the Republican president and Harvard, the country’s oldest higher-education institution.

Since taking office for a second term on January 20, Trump has sought to increase his control over US universities and crack down on what he considers “illegal protests” on campus.

But Harvard has been a focal point for his public ire, particularly after school leaders refused a list of demands the Trump administration sent on April 11.

In a five-page letter (PDF), Trump officials called on Harvard to reform its student disciplinary system, investigate protesters involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, commission an external audit of programmes deemedanti-Semiticand eliminate its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

The letter also required Harvard to commit to “viewpoint diversity” in its hiring and admissions practices, something it was expected to accomplish through “structural and personnel changes”. Critics said this mandate was tantamount to Trump attempting to impose a political litmus test on the school.







By April 14, Harvard’s President Alan Garber had rejected the letter. In astatementpublished to Harvard’s website, he explained that Trump’s demands infringed upon Harvard’s academic freedom, among other rights.

“The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”

The Trump administration swiftly responded bysuspending nearly $2.2bnin grants and contracts to the school.

It has since filed a lawsuit (PDF) challenging Trump’sattempts to withhold federal fundingfrom the school, calling the move “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard”.

Shortly after halting the grants and contracts, Trump turned his attention to Harvard’s tax exempt status, ratcheting up the pressure on the school.

Educational institutions, charities, nonprofits and institutions of scientific research are among the entities eligible to apply for tax exempt status under US law. That status offers those organisations relief from paying federal income and property taxes.

But on April 15, Trump mused on social media that Harvard should lose that exemption, on account of its handling of pro-Palestinian student protests.

“Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax-Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’” Trump wrote.

US media reports later indicated that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was having internal deliberations about whether to revoke the school’s IRS status, despite such action being relatively rare.

But under the US Code, it is illegal for the president, vice president or any of their employees to petition the IRS — even indirectly — to conduct an audit of any taxpayer.







Democrats have seized on that fact to push for an investigation into the Trump administration’s actions towards Harvard.

“The President is targeting the non-profit status of Harvard University for blatantly political purposes,” Democratic senators including Chuck Schumer, Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren wrote in ajoint letteron Friday.

“The president’s call for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status raises troubling constitutional questions, including whether the president is trying to squelch Harvard’s free speech rights and whether the revocation of its tax-exempt status will deprive the university of its due process rights.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/2/donald-trump-renews-threats-against-harvard-universitys-tax-exempt-status
Donald Trump,Donald Trump: The Islamophobia president,"Islamophobia won resoundingly tonight. Instead of the first female president, the United States got its first Islamophobia president.

From start to finish, the 2016 presidential election vividly revealed that Islamophobia is alive, and potent and politically resonant as ever. Scapegoating Islam and vilifying Muslims was far more than merely campaign messaging; for Donald Trump it wasa winning strategy.









Trump’s full-blown Islamophobia resonated deeply with voters. Moreover, it mobilised more than just a fringe or rabid demographic, but a sizable segment of the American polity to cast votes in his favour.









It helped him carry Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and virtually every battleground state.

Long before election night, earlier numbers indicated that Trump’s deployment of Islamophobia as a primary campaign strategy would pay dividends and register votes.

AnNBC pollconducted in December 2015 found that 25 percent of Americans supported Trump’s Muslim ban.A March 2016poll indicated greater support, with 51 percent favouring Trump’s Ban ”until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on”.

Trump interpreted these staggering figures, which rose as the campaign progressed, as strong support for his Islamophobia campaign.

Trump will bring an administration that is entirely devoid of Muslim Americans and at minimum, individuals without genuine reach into or backing from Muslim Americans. His campaign lacked any bona fide Muslim American involvement, and the Trump administration will likely reflect that.

He delivered what the market demanded, and doubled down on his anti-Muslim rhetoric. He fed the Islamophobia his loud and angry base demanded, and as indicated by election results, a sizable portion of the silent, white majority.

Trump won because he was willing to deliver Islamophobia in the blatant and brazen terms his Republican peers and predecessors would not fully commit to.

Instead of adopting George W Bush’s or Mitt Romney’scautious Islamophobia, or Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton’s exclusive mention of Muslims from the lens of national security policy – Trump went all the way.

He stripped any mitigating rhetoric, aimed to placate liberals and moderates, from his message. He did away with staple qualifiers like “peace loving”and “moderate” when talking about Muslims.

In fact, Trump swept aside every political platitude and carefully crafted talking point for a blatantly hateful grassroots framing.

Instead of “Islam is peace”, Trump declared that, “Islam hates us”, giving disaffected bigoted voters exactly what they wanted.

OPINION: A dismal day for human rights in the US

He embraced the hateful language ofQuran-burning rallies, anti-mosque protests, and perhaps most violently, the ugly underbelly that is the comments’ sections of news articles. Trump sounded more like the Islamophobes on-the-ground torching mosques, instead of Islamophobes in political offices supporting surveillance of mosques.

This presidential campaign foreshadows what is sure to follow.Hate crimesagainst Muslims rose considerably in 2015 and statistics show a similar trend in 2016. If a Trump presidential campaign resulted in an unprecedented number of hate crimes against Muslims, one can only imagine what a Trump presidency will bring.

It will bring an expanded surveillance state, where counter-radicalisation policing in Muslim communities will be more pervasive and far-reaching. This will make it far more difficult for Muslims to freely exercise their faith, and the most benign symbols of Muslim identity will trigger suspicion.

It will bring in “extreme vetting” of Muslim immigrants, and very likely, entirely bar the entry of refugees from war-torn states. Therefore, even if a fully-fledged Muslim ban is not enacted – sweeping, strident policies impairing legal admission of Muslim immigrants will be law.

OPINION: The US is not a post-racial society

It will bring an administration that is entirely devoid of Muslim Americans and at minimum, individuals without genuine reach into or backing from Muslim Americans. The Trump campaign lacked any bona fide Muslim American involvement, and the Trump administration will likely reflect that.

Most alarmingly, it will usher in a cultural movement (and moment) whereby the highest office in government authorises discrimination and violence against Muslim Americans. If the president of the US is the very archetype and orchestrator of Islamophobia, then assailing Muslims, torching mosques, and attacking anybody who looks Muslim is fair game.

What seemed a far-fetched idea is in fact America’s reckoning. The absurd is reality. Islamophobia is no longer campaign messaging or strategy, but come January, formal, full-blown White House policy.

I watched the election night returns alongside 200 Muslim Americans in Dearborn, Michigan – the most concentrated Muslim American community in the country.

Fear was palpable. Adults cried. Young people led prayers. What loomed tomorrow was bleak, and the wedge between Muslim and American seemed never stronger.

Enter Donald Trump, American President. Brace yourselves, Muslim Americans.

Donald Trump,China urges Trump to tone down North Korea rhetoric,"Chinese leaderXi Jinpingurged US President Donald Trump on Saturday to avoid rhetoric that could inflame tensions withNorth Koreaas an escalating war of words raised global alarm.

Xi made the plea in a phone call hours afterTrumpescalated his warnings to North Korea, saying it would “truly regret” taking hostile action against theUS.









China’s foreign ministry said Xi urged Trump to avoid “words and deeds” that would “exacerbate” the already tense situation, exercise restraint, and seek a political settlement.









Al Jazeera’s Adrian Brown, reporting from Beijing, said the message from Xi to Trump was made clear in the “short, but polite” telephone call.

“This was a chance for the Chinese president to show to his people that he is trying to take the lead in trying to resolve this crisis,” he said.

North Korea said it would complete plans by mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles overJapanto land near the US Pacific island territory of Guam, after Trump said any threats by Pyongyang would be “met with fire and fury like the world has never seen”.

Brown said China wants to avoid regime change in North Korea because it fears anarchy and arefugeeinflux. “President Xi doesn’t always, I think, believe that the US understands the difficult situation it is in and he feels that the US in some ways has been arm twisting China for the past couple of weeks.”

Both leaders also pressed Pyongyang to halt its own threats.

“President Trump and President Xi agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior. The presidents also reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” a White House statement said.

The North’s official KCNA news service in an editorial blamed Trump for “driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war”, calling the US “the heinous nuclear war fanatic”.

Japanese media said Tokyo was deploying its Patriot missile defence system.









The defence ministry deployed the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system in Shimane, Hiroshima, and Kochi in western Japan, which North Korea had warned could be along its missiles’ flight path, public broadcaster NHK and Kyodo News said.

It also deployed the anti-missile system in neighbouring Ehime, according to the reports, while the Asahi Shimbun said one Maritime Self-Defence Force Aegis destroyer was stationed in the East Sea to shoot down airborne missiles.

Television footage showed military vehicles carrying launchers and other equipment for the surface-to-air system entering a Japanese base in Kochi before dawn.

US military forces “stand ready” to safeguard Guam after North Korea threatened to fire ballistic missiles towards the American Pacific island territory, the White House said early Saturday.

During a call with Guam Governor Eddie Calvo, Trump “reassured” him the “United States forces stand ready to ensure the safety and security of the people of Guam, along with the rest of America,” a statement said.

INFOGRAPHIC: North Korea explained in graphics

Guam’s government, meanwhile, issued fliers with emergency tips on what to do in case of a North Korean strike.

If an attack warning is issued, Guam residents should take cover quickly – in a concrete structure, preferably underground – and stay there until instructed otherwise, according to a fact sheet titled “Preparing for an Imminent Missile Threat.”

Guam’s Office of Civil Defence began disseminating fact sheets on Friday.









“Do not look at the flash or fireball – it can blind you,” the missile threat prep fact sheet advises those who are caught outside. “Lie flat on the ground and cover your head.”

The flier also offers guidance on removing radioactive material: “When possible, take a shower with lots of soap and water to help remove radioactive contamination.”

But don’t scratch or scrub skin and “do not use conditioner in your hair because it will bind radioactive material to your hair”.

On the streets of Guam, the outward appearance remained calm with the main concern being the approach of the typhoon season.

“To be honest, I’m more worried about the projectiles from the typhoons when we get strong winds than whatever projectiles Kim Jong-un says he will launch on Guam,” Janice Furukawa, a 58-year-old mother, said as she prepared her typhoon emergency kit at her home in the western village of Piti.

Trump assured Calvo that Guam is safe. “We are with you a 1,000 percent,” Trump said, according to video of the call posted on Calvo’s Facebook page. “You are safe.”

Calvo responded by saying he feels safe and confident with Trump’s leadership: “I’m glad you’re holding the helm, sir.”

Donald Trump,Trump pledges to tap Elon Musk to head government efficiency commission,"Former United States President Donald Trump has pledged to create a “government efficiency” commission headed by entrepreneur Elon Musk if he is victorious in seeking re-election this November.

Trump made the pledge as he laid out hiseconomic visionin a campaign speech at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.

Promises of economic prosperity have been a backbone of Trump’s re-election bid in 2024, and he used Thursday’s speech to showcase his plans for a “national economic renaissance”.

They include oft-repeated proposals to slash regulations on energy production, cut government spending and lower corporate taxes for US companies.

Less familiar were his plans to embrace cryptocurrency and create the Musk-led commission, which he said would eliminate “fraud and improper payments” within six months of being formed.

“I will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms,” Trump said.

The US government already has the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO), a federal watchdog agency tasked with investigating federal spending and performance. Trump did not offer details about the proposed new commission or how it would operate.







Still, the pledge was swiftly condemned by the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents about 750,000 federal workers.

In a statement to the Reuters news agency, Everett Kelley accused Trump and Musk of wanting to gut the nonpartisan civil service sector and replace fired workers with political allies.

“There’s nothing efficient about that,” Kelley said.

For his part, Musk wrote on X that he would accept the post if Trump were to win the November 5 election. He had previously said during a podcast in August that he had discussed the commission with Trump.

“I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises,” said Musk, who purchased the social media company X, then known as Twitter, in 2022. “No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.”

He quickly lifted Trump’s ban from the platform after acquiring it. He later endorsed Trump for president following anassassination attemptagainst the Republican leader in July.

The economy has emerged as a key issue in the 2024 presidential election, in which Trump is facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate. That comes as US consumers continue to struggle with the cost of living, despite inflation slowing over the past two years.

Last month, Harris unveiled a populist-leaning economic vision that would ban “price gouging” on groceries. It also would boost first-time homebuyers, offer a child tax credit and create tax incentives for affordable home builders.

On Wednesday, she also said she would seek an increase to the capital gains tax for wealthy Americans — but that it would be lower than a similar increase proposed by President Joe Biden.

Harris plans to implement a 28 percent tax on investment profits for those in the highest income bracket, less than the 39.6 percent proposed by Biden. The move has been seen as an effort to broaden Harris’s appeal among the ultra-wealthy.







Speaking before several prominent CEOs on Thursday, Trump reiterated hisplanto cut the US corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 21 percent, but only for companies that manufacture domestically.

He also said he would open up tracts of federal land to homebuilding in a bid to drive down housing costs. These new housing zones would be “low tax” and “low regulation”, Trump said, without elaborating.

Polls have indicated that voters generally view Trump as better suited to handling the economy than Harris, although the pair remain neck and neck in national polls, as well as surveys of battleground states.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/5/trump-pledges-to-tap-elon-musk-to-head-government-efficiency-commission

Donald Trump,"Trump presidency: Military to migration, what to know — and what’s next","United States President Donald Trumpsigned a series of executive orderson Monday aimed at reshaping military policies, including the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI), reinstating service members discharged for refusing COVID-19 vaccines, and barring transgender people from military service.

Earlier in the day, newly confirmed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who secured the position after a narrow Senate vote, said he would ensure the orders “are complied with rapidly and quickly”.

Here is the latest news from Monday and a look ahead for the week.

Speaking with reporters on board Air Force One on Monday, Trump said that he signed four executive orders.

Among those, Trump revealed he signedan orderto establish a framework for developing what his administration calls an “American Iron Dome,” a missile defence system designed to protect the homeland.

“We have to have a strong, strong defence,” Trump said. “And in a little while, I’ll be signing four new executive orders.”

He explained that the first was to “immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defence shield, which will be able to protect Americans”.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on Monday that it made 1,179 arrests and issued 853 detainers – a tool used by the ICE officers to take custody of criminal noncitizens inside jails – as part of a nationwide enforcement effort. This is the biggest number since Trump took office a week ago.

The agency reported that therecent crackdownhas led to at least 3,552 arrests since Thursday. Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the average daily arrests of noncitizens with criminal convictions or pending charges was 467 and 310 in 2023 and 2024 respectively, according to a CBS Newsreport.

Separately, Colombia has stepped back from the edge of a potential trade war with the US after Trump threatened tariffs in response to Bogota’s refusal to accept deported flights. Colombia is now sending its own planes to the US to retrieve its citizens.

In his first full day at the Pentagon, Hegseth said more military personnel would most likely be soon dispatched to the southern border, joining about 4,000 already there.

“The undocumented immigrants we’ve talked to said they are living in fear,” Al Jazeera’s John Hendren said, reporting from Chicago.

“Many of them are staying home, not going to school, not going to work. In the area of Little Village, a Hispanic neighbourhood in Chicago, many shops are empty. And that suggests what the Trump administration is trying to do with this shock campaign may be working,” he added.

Trump said that the artificial intelligence technology developed by Chinesestartup DeepSeekshould motivate American companies. He also acknowledged that it was positive for China to have developed a cheaper and faster method of AI.

“I’ve been reading about China and some of the companies in China, one in particular coming up with a faster method of AI and much less expensive method, and that’s good because you don’t have to spend as much money. I view that as a positive, as an asset,” Trump said.

deepseek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price.

we will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases.

Donald Trump,Donald Trump withdraws US from Paris climate accord,"TheUSis withdrawing from the Paris agreement on climate change, President DonaldTrumphas announced at a White House Rose Garden speech.

Before the announcement, Trump informed Congress about his decision preparing Republican legislators with arguments and lines to take in the face of an expected blowback.









Trump said it was his solemn duty to protect “America and its citizens” and that the US would “withdraw from the Paris climate accord, but begin negotiations to re-enter the Paris accord or a new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States”.

He said: “So we are getting out, but we will start to negotiate and see if we can make a deal that’s fair.”

READ MORE: Why the Paris Deal matters?

Trump described the Paris climate accord as an “agreement that is disadvantageous to the US to the exclusive benefits of other countries”.

The withdrawal also includes the cancellation of all US contributions to the Green Climate Fund, which Trump said was “costing the US a vast fortune”.

According to the rules of the 2016 Paris deal, stepping out of its provisions will be a lengthy process that could take up to four years.

Trump said he could not “in good conscience support a deal that punishes the US and that poses no punishment for the world’s great polluters”.

Trump claimed “the nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the same nations that cost America trillions of dollars through unfair trade agreements, and the same that do not contribute to military alliances.

“At what point do they start laughing at us? […] I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not the citizens of Paris,” he said.

US coal company shares dipped alongside renewable energy stocks on Wednesday after reports that Trump plans to pull the US from a global accord on fighting climate change.







The market reaction reflects concerns, raised by some coal companies in recent months, that a US exit from the Paris Climate Agreement could unleash a global backlash against coal interests outside the US.

Barack Obamacriticised Trump on Thursday for pulling out of the Paris climate deal, warning that the move would see the US “reject the future”.

“The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,” Obama warned in a statement.

Jean-Claude Juncker,European Commission president,on Thursday rejected as “seriously wrong” Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Parisclimatedeal.

InGermany, a statement issued by seven Social Democratic ministers in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s left-right coalition government said the US “is harming itself, we Europeans and all the people of the world”.

German ministers claim “the land of the free and the home of the brave is contradicting its basic principles”.

The statement also states that the door will be kept open for the US to join at a later date as the “global community must stick together now”.

Catherine McKenna,Canadian environment minister,said her country is “deeply disappointed by the US decision on the Paris accord”.

And Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo says US decision to pull out of the climate accord “is a mistake with dramatic consequences”.

The US withdrawal from the accord fulfils one of Trump’s major campaign promises, and is in line with the America First policy he laid out before being elected president.

Earlier on Thursday, Chinasaid it would keep up its end of the Paris climate change accord, even if the US pulls out from the agreement.

Li Keqiang, China’s prime minister, said his country will continue to work with the EU and other countries to uphold the deal.

Speaking after bilateral talks with German Chancellor AngelaMerkelin Berlin, Li said it was “also in our interest … to work step by step towards sustainable development” and environmental protection together with the international community.

Continental Europe’s three biggest economies – Germany,Franceand Italy – criticised Donald Trump’s decision to quit the Paris climate agreement and said the pact was “not renegotiable”.

“We note the United States’ decision with regret,” the three countries said in a rare joint statement.

“We are firmly convinced that the agreement cannot be renegotiated,” they added, referring to Trump’s announcement that Washington was open to negotiating a new agreement.

And the mayor of Pittsburgh tweeted that the city will follow the guidelines of the Paris accord “for our people, our economy [and] future”.

Donald Trump,"What are Trump’s plans for tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico?","United States President-elect Donald Trump hasthreatened to impose sweeping tariffs on the United States’s three largest trading partners– Canada, Mexico and China – as soon as he takes office on January 20.

While Trump used tariffs during his first term to punish countries such as China for what he said were unfair trade practices, he has cast the latest measures as a response to the flow of illegal drugs and undocumented migrants across the US border.

“Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long-simmering problem,” Trump said on Monday in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

“We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”

Trump said he would sign an executive order imposing a 25 percent tariff on all Mexican and Canadian imports and an “additional” 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods on the first day of his administration.

It was not immediately clear if the proposed tariffs would be in addition to tariffs he floated while on campaign trail.

During his election campaign, Trump said he would impose tariffs of 60 percent or more on imports of Chinese goods and suggested he could impose a tariff of 1,000 percent or higher on vehicles imported from Mexico.

In his announcement on Monday, the president-elect said the tariffs would remain on Mexican and Canadian goods until the “invasion” of drugs and undocumented migrants came to an end.

He said the tariffs would apply to Chinese goods until Beijing took action to stop the flow of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year, into the country.

Some Trump allies have suggested that the president-elect sees the threat of tariffs primarily as a bargaining chip to use in future negotiations with foreign countries.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum held a press conference on Tuesday, in which she said that she planned to send Trump a letter highlighting the importance of their two countries working together.

Sheinbaum warned that the imposition of tariffs would lead to more tariffs, inflation and job losses “until we put our common businesses at risk”.

For his part, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday that he had spoken to Trump in a phone call on Monday evening.

“We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. It was a good call,” Trudeau said. “This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that’s what we’ll do.”

Ontario Premier Doug Ford issued a more direct warning, saying the tariffs would be “devastating to workers and jobs in both the US and Canada”.

“The federal government needs to take the situation at our border seriously. We need a Team Canada approach and response – and we need it now. Prime Minister Trudeau must call an urgent meeting with all premiers,” Ford said in a post on X.

China’s embassy in Washington said a trade war would not benefit either side.

“About the issue of US tariffs on China, China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature,” spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement.

The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso slipped to their lowest level against US dollar since 2020 and 2022, respectively, after Trump’s announcement.

China’s yuan weakened to its lowest level since July.

Other major currencies, including the euro, British pound, the Korean won and the Australian dollar, also fell.

Most of Asia’s major stock indexes fell, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.96 percent at one point on Tuesday.

Markets will be taking note that Trump appears serious about reducing the US trade deficit with other countries, said Steve Okun, founder and CEO of Singapore-based APAC Advisors.

China, Mexico and Canada are the US’s three biggest trading partners, accounting for $830bn of US exports and $1.43 trillion of US imports, respectively, in 2022, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.

The US imports more than it exports in the case of all three countries.

Last year, the trade deficit stood at $67.9bn for Canada, $152.4bn for Mexico, and $279.4bn for China, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The fact that the US has a trade deficit with many of its trading partners has preoccupied Trump since his first term in office and was cited as part of his rationale for initiating a trade war with China in 2018.

“What the rest of the world should take from this is that Trump views relationships on a bilateral perspective and Trump views relationships based on whether the US has a trade deficit or a trade surplus with a given country,” Okun told Al Jazeera.

“If the US has a trade deficit with a country, you address the deficit, typically through tariffs.”

The immediate impact would be to make it more expensive for companies in Canada, Mexico and China to export goods to the US, cutting into their bottom line.

Companies, in turn, are likely to pass these higher costs on to customers, leading to higher prices.

The tariffs would likely have a serious impact on Mexico’s auto industry in particular, as the Central American country is home to manufacturing plants for Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda and Kia, as well as a number of Chinese auto part suppliers.

The tariffs would also hit Asian tech companies such as Foxconn, Nvidia, Lenovo and LG, which expanded their footprint in Mexico with server facilities and factories that produce everything from electric vehicle parts to flat-screen TVs.

Canadian media reported that even a 10 percent tariff could result in $21bn (Canadian $30 billion) a year in economic costs, citing previous estimates from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

The country’s main exports to the US are petroleum, gas and vehicles.

In the longer term, tariffs would have an inflationary impact in the US and negatively affect global trade, according to Gary Ng, senior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong.

“The tariffs can lead to higher inflation in the US, meaning the Fed will find it harder to cut rates,” Ng told Al Jazeera, referring to the US central bank.

“Therefore, the direct implication is that the dollar will remain strong, and global central banks will find it hard to relax policies unless they accept currency depreciation … This is positive for US growth in the short run but bad for the rest of the world.”

Some analysts believe Trump is using tariffs to signal to Canada and Mexico that he intends to renegotiate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a free trade agreement that he signed in 2020 as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Although the USMCA updated the terms of trade in some areas, it largely kept NAFTA’s original provisions in place.

“Trump has made very clear that USMCA is something that needs to be relooked at and renegotiated when he becomes president. You could look at these tariffs on Mexico and Canada as a precursor to a renegotiation,” Okun said.

Tim Harcourt, chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy and Governance at the University of Technology Sydney, said the tariffs would effectively end free trade among the US, Canada and Mexico.

“The president-elect says it’s based on banning the drug fentanyl by halting trade – or providing a disincentive – and immigration, but non-fentanyl goods will get caught in the crossfire,” Harcourt told Al Jazeera.

Donald Trump,Trump threatens to cut aid over UN Jerusalem vote,"US PresidentDonald Trumphas threatened to cut aid to countries that vote in favour of a draftUNresolution condemning the US decision to recogniseJerusalemas the capital ofIsrael.

Trump said at the White House on Wednesday the US would be “watching those votes” in the General Assembly.









“They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we’re watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We’ll save a lot. We don’t care,” Reuters news agency quoted Trump as saying.

The UN General Assembly will hold an emergency session on Thursday to vote on the controversial US decision.

The motion is expected to pass easily in the 193-member UN body, but it will be non-binding.

Trump’s comments came after Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN, sent threatening letters to UN member states, urging them to vote against the motion.

Haley also said on Twitter “the US will be taking names” of countries that vote in favour of the resolution.

At the UN we're always asked to do more & give more. So, when we make a decision, at the will of the American ppl, abt where to locate OUR embassy, we don't expect those we've helped to target us.

Riyad al-Malki,Palestinian foreign minister,on Wednesday accused the US of “threatening” member countries of the UN General Assembly in advance of the vote.

Malki said American officials were “committing another mistake when they have distributed this famous letter trying to threaten countries, [and] threaten their sovereign decision to choose how to vote”.

“This is really a new definition of world order in politics and it seems that the American administration … are putting their stamp on a new political reality that many countries will reject,” Malki said.

The UN session would show “how many countries will opt to vote with their conscience”.

Trumpdeclaredon December 6Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital and announced the intention to move its embassy to the city.

The contentious move prompted large-scaleprotestsand condemnation from leaders around the world.

During his first seven days, Trump deployed the military to the southern border and signed a series of executive orders – 26 issued within hours of taking office – addressing issues ranging from diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes to renaming the Gulf of Mexico.









One of his biggest promises during this term is to tackleirregular immigration. Here are the latest updates from his presidency and what is expected on Monday:

Trump declared a victory on Sunday after announcing thatColombia had backed downin a dispute over migrant deportation flights.

The crisis erupted when Colombian President Gustavo Petro earlier on Sunday had blocked US military cargo planes carrying undocumented migrants from landing.

Petro said he wouldn’t accept the flights unless the US treats deportees with dignity and respect. Trump retaliated with tariffs on all Colombian imports, a travel ban for Colombian citizens, the cancellation of visas for Colombian officials in the US, and the suspension of processing for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visas.

But after hours of tensions with Bogota, the US said Colombia had agreed to accept migrant deportation flights, including on military aircraft, and the tariffs would be put on hold. Trump allies bragged that the outcome was a win for the president and a loss for Petro.

Petro fell in line.

The use of US military aircraft for deportation flights was unusual until Trump took office. Two flights, each carrying about 80 deported migrants, were made to Guatemala on Friday. Mexico last week rejected a landing request for a US military plane with migrants on board. Previously, Trump suggested that he might impose 25-percent, across-the-board tariffs on Mexican goods starting in February.

Oliver Della Costa Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo, Brazil, said Trump may get his way with Latin American countries in the short term but his aggressive tactics could push leaders in the region to seek alternative partners to Washington.

“Leaders across Latin America will look at these moments and will, I think, be increasingly aware of the risk of being too dependent on the US,” Stuenkel told Al Jazeera.

“They will seek to diversify their partnerships because, for weaker countries, dealing with Washington is very challenging and the best way to increase your leverage when negotiating with Trump and expand your room for manoeuvre is to have alternatives to the US. It’s to not be in a situation where you are so dependent that you have nowhere to run,”Stuenkel said.







On Saturday, Trump proposed relocating more than one million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to other countries and “cleaning out the whole thing”.

“I would like Egypt to take people,” Trump said. “You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, ‘You know, it’s over.’”

Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees in the past and he told King Abdullah II: “I would love for you to take on more ‘cause I am looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess. It’s a real mess.” Currently, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), more than 2.39 million registered Palestine refugees live in Jordan, which has a population of 11.1 million people.

Israel’s 15-month war on Gaza has displaced almost all of the enclave’s 2.3 million residents, some of them multiple times. Trump said Gaza’s inhabitants could be moved “temporarily or could be long term”.

The proposal was roundly rejected by Palestinians on Sunday.

“It’s impossible for people to accept this,” Palestinian Nafiz Halawa told Al Jazeera from Nuseirat in central Gaza. “The weak might leave because of the suffering they have endured, but the idea of us leaving our country, … it’s absolutely impossible.“







JD Vance’s first interview:JD Vance gave his first interview since becoming the US vice president, discussing issues with CBS News that included Trump’s immigration policy and his executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. While legal experts have said the US Constitution must be changed to end it, Vance doubled down on the Trump administration’s justification for the order.

“Temporary residents, people who come in here, whether legally or illegally, and don’t plan to stay, their children shouldn’t become American citizens,” he said. “I don’t know any country that does that or why we would be different.” However,many countriesoffer birthright citizenship, including Canada, Mexico, Belize and Argentina.

Pete Hegseth speaks to Benjamin Netanyahu:US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth talked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, marking the Pentagon chief’s first call with a foreign leader since taking up his post. Hegseth and Netanyahu “discussed the importance of advancing mutual security interests and priorities, especially in the face of persistent threats,” the Pentagon said in a statement.

According to US media reports, Trump is expected to attend the annual retreat of Republican members of the House of Representatives at Trump National Doral Miami, his golf resort outside Miami, Florida.

Party retreats give lawmakers an opportunity to come together, discuss policies and strategise on the best ways to implement them.

House Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, are expected to focus on crafting a bill that incorporates the administration’s key priorities – including energy, border security and tax policy.

Separately, a US Senate vote on the nomination of Trump’s Treasury secretary nominee, Scott Bessent, is planned for Monday afternoon.

The head of the Department of the Treasury has broad oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.

Bessent, a Wall Street financier who once worked for George Soros, was an early backer of Trump’s 2024 presidential bid, donating at least $3m to the campaign, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/27/trump-spotlight-a-clash-with-colombia-and-what-lies-ahead-on-monday
Donald Trump,African states demand Trump apologise for racist remark,"The African group of ambassadors to theUnited Nationshas demanded an apology fromDonald Trump, after the US president reportedly aimed a racist remark at some Caribbean nations and Africa.

Trumpcriticisedimmigration to his country from El Salvador, Haiti and the African continent, by calling the group “shithole countries” at a meeting with Congress members at the White House on Thursday, according to US media.









“The African Union mission to the UN is extremely appalled at, and strongly condemns the outrageous, racist and xenophobic remarks attributed to the US president as widely reported by the media,” Martha Ama Akyaa Pobee, Ghana’s ambassador to the UN, said on Friday.

The group has demanded a retraction and apology from Trump.

According to US media reports, citing people with knowledge of the conversation, Trump asked during aconversation about immigration: “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”

Trump suggested the US should instead focus its immigrant entry policy on countries such as Norway.



Following an emergency session of the African diplomats, Pobee added that the group “is concerned at the continuing and growing trend from the US administration towards Africa and people of African descent to denigrate the continent and people of colour”.

The ambassadors’ reaction comes after the 55-nation African Union said it was “frankly alarmed”.

“Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behaviour and practice,” AU spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo said on Friday.

Trump’s latest comments have sparked global outrage and have been widely condemned as racist and extremely offensive.

Al Jazeera’sKimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, said: “The calls for the president to apologise for his remarks are intensifying inside and outside the US, but for now, that apology does not appear likely.”

Rupert Colville, a spokesman with the UN human rights office, earlier slammed Trump’s “vulgar language”.

“You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as shitholes … I’m sorry, but there’s no other word one can use but racist,” Colville said.

Trump denied the racist remarks, tweeting on Friday that the language he used “was tough, but this was not the language used”, as he called for a “merit-based system of immigration and people who take our country to the next level”.

Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings – unfortunately, no trust!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)January 12, 2018



He later tweeted that he has “never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously a very poor and troubled country”.

The Republican president has also privately defended his remarks, saying he was only expressing what many people think but will not say about immigrants from economically depressed countries, the Associated Press reported.

Democrats have dismissed Trump’s denial of the offensive comments, with Senator Dick Durbin, who attended the meeting, disputing Trump’s account.

“He said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly,” Durbin told reporters on Friday.

Members of his own Republican party have also distanced themselves from Trump’s comments.

“It is incomprehensible that these words came out of the mouth of the president of the United States of America, a country that was founded on being free from discrimination,” saidIleana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican congresswoman.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/1/13/african-states-demand-trump-apologise-for-racist-remark
Donald Trump,TikTok restoring US service as Trump promises executive order to delay ban,"TikTok said it was restoring service to users in the United States after the popular video-sharing platform went dark in response to a federal ban that US President-elect Donald Trump said he would try to pause by executive order on his first day in office.

Trump said earlier on Sunday that he planned to issue the order to give TikTok’s China-based parent company more time to find an approved buyer before the popular video-sharing platform is subject to apermanent US ban.

Trump announced the decision in a post on his Truth Social account on Sunday as millions of TikTok users in the US awoke to discover they could no longer access the TikTok app or platform.

Google and Apple removed the app from their digital stores to comply with a federal law that required them to do so if TikTok’s parent company ByteDance did not sell its US operation by Sunday.

The law, which passed with wide bipartisan support in April due to national security concerns posed by the app’s Chinese roots, allowed for steep fines for noncompliance.

Trump said his order would “extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect” and “confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order”.

The company that runs TikTok said in a post on X that Trump’s post had provided “the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans”.

Some users reported soon after TikTok’s statement that the app was working again, and TikTok’s website appeared to be functioning for at least some users. Even as TikTok was flickering back on, it remained unavailable for download in Apple and Google’s app stores.

The law gives the sitting US president authority to grant a 90-day extension if a viable sale is under way. Although investors made a few offers, ByteDance previously said it would not sell.

In his post on Sunday, Trump said he “would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture”, but it was not immediately clear if he was referring to the government or a US company.

“By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up,” Trump wrote. “Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars – maybe trillions.”

Trump’s incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told CNN on Sunday that the president-elect doesn’t rule out continued Chinese ownership coupled with “firewalls to make sure that the data is protected” in the US.

“We can have an app that Americans can enjoy, but at the same time that protects their data, protects them from outside influence,” he said.







On Friday, the US Supreme Courtupheld a lawmandating the app’s ban unless parent company ByteDance divests TikTok’s US operations.

In court, the administration of outgoing US President Joe Biden defended the law by citing concerns that TikTok collects extensive amounts of US user data, which could potentially be accessed by the Chinese government through coercion.

Officials have also cautioned that the app’s algorithm, which determines what content users see, could be manipulated by Chinese authorities to influence the platform in subtle and hard-to-detect ways.

However, the US has yet to present public evidence showing that TikTok has shared user data with Chinese authorities or altered its algorithm to serve Chinese interests.

ByteDance has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls to sell its US operations, leaving the platform in limbo.

The US law requires Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, blocking new downloads. The companies could face penalties of up to $5,000 per user who can access the app.

Oracle, which hosts TikTok’s servers, would also be legally obligated to enforce the ban.

Meanwhile, US-based competitors such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts stand to benefit from TikTok’s forced absence.

Another Chinese platform, Xiaohongshu, meaning Little Red Book, has gained traction among American users, becoming the most downloaded app on Apple’s US store this week.

Several investors have proposed last-minute solutions to keep TikTok operational.

According to media reports, Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence startup backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, submitted a plan to merge with TikTok’s US business to create a new entity, potentially allowing ByteDance to retain partial ownership.

Other offers, including a $20bn bid from a consortium led by Canadian investor Kevin O’Leary and billionaire Frank McCourt, remain under consideration.

Experts warn that even if Trump issues an executive order to delay the ban, it may face legal challenges.

“Congress wrote this law to be virtually president-proof,” warned Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of the industry trade group Chamber of Progress.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/19/tiktok-goes-dark-for-us-users-ahead-of-trumps-inauguration
Donald Trump,"Trump slams Mueller investigation, draws Republican ire","PresidentDonald Trumphas lashed out at what he considers to be the impartiality of an ongoing investigation into potential collusion with a foreign state.

Trump used Twitter on Sunday to criticise the legal basis of the Russia investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.









“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added … does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!

Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added…does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)March 18, 2018



It was the first time Trump mentioned Mueller by name, which led a group of Republican senators to suggest the president might be contemplating firing the special counsel.

Senator Lindsey Graham – co-author of legislation that would complicate the firing of a special counsel by the president – said Mueller’s dismissal would spell “the beginning of the end of his [Trump’s] presidency”.

Senator Jeff Flake said Congress cannot stay quiet if the president decides to move in that direction.

“I don’t know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that [dismissing Mueller], and I just hope it doesn’t go there, because it can’t. We can’t in Congress accept that,” said Flake.

Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, has called on the Justice Department official overlooking the Russia investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to “bring an end” to the probe.

Some Republicans, however, are asking why the president’s lawyer is expending so much energy on a case where the president is presumably innocent.

“I think the president’s attorney, frankly, does him a disservice when he says that and when he frames the investigation that way … If you have an innocent client, Mr Dowd, act like it,”Representative TreyGowdy told reporters on Sunday.

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan requested that Mueller and his team be “able to do their job”.

Sunday’s developments come just days after FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was dismissed, citing a “lack of candor” with regard to authorising personnel to talk to the media.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/3/18/trump-slams-mueller-investigation-draws-republican-ire
Donald Trump,US Election 2024,"Former President Donald Trump hammered home an anti-immigration theme in his closing argument pitch to voters on October 27 atNew York City’s Madison Square Garden.

But before Trump spoke, the event made headlines for a series of racist jokesby comedianTony Hinchcliffe. He called Puerto Rico an “island of garbage” and disparaged Black Americans, Latinos and Jewish people. Democrats and at least two Florida Republicans, including Senator Rick Scott, swiftly condemned Hinchcliffe’s remarks about Puerto Rico.

“This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,” Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign said in a statement after the rally addressing the comedian’s comment about Puerto Rico.

At the rally, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said he presided over the most secure border in United States history (he did not), that the Federal Emergency Management Agency did not deliver hurricane relief because the government spent its money bringing immigrants into the country illegally (it did not) and that foreign nations were emptying their prisons and sending convicts to the US (they are not).

A gaggle of speakers preceded Trump, including Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance, Trump’s sons Eric and Don Jr, Trump’s wife, Melania, his daughter-in-law and Republican National Committee co-Chair Lara Trump, US House Speaker Mike Johnson, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, entrepreneur Elon Musk and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Carlson riffed about Harris’s potential victory marking “the first Samoan, Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president”. Harris identifies as a Black woman of multicultural descent; her mother was born in India and her father was born in Jamaica.

Trump nevertheless said the Republican Party he leads “has really become the party of inclusion, and there’s something very nice about that”.

Trump’s choice of New York City as a rally site may have challenged political logic; New York, as a state, has voted for the Democratic candidate for president for decades, though Madison Square Garden has hosted major political events for more than a century. Appearing in New York City also placed Trump in the back yard of officials whom he frequently has criticised, including District Attorney Alvin Bragg who obtained a34-count felony convictionagainst Trump for falsifying business records.

Here are eight claims we fact-checked, leading with four about immigration.

Pants on Fire!There isno evidencethat countries are emptying their prisons – or mental institutions – and sending people to illegally migrate to the US.

Immigration officials arrested about 108,000 non-citizens with criminal convictions (whether in the US or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in.

Legal experts toldPolitiFactthat Trump does not have the authority to use the law to carry out mass deportations and that invoking it would lead to legal challenges.

The Alien Enemies Act lets a president quickly deport noncitizens without due process if they are from a country at war with the US.

The law has been used only three times in US history, all during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was during World War II, and it was used to place non-citizens from Japan, Germany and Italy in internment camps.

This is adistortionof federal data about migrant children.

An August federal oversight report about unaccompanied minors released from federal government custody said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had not served a “Notice to Appear” to more than 291,000 unaccompanied minors, as of May. (A notice to appear is a charging document authorities issue and file in immigration court to start removal proceedings.)

The report said unaccompanied children “who do not appear for court are considered at higher risk for trafficking, exploitation, or forced labour”. The report does not state how many children have actually been trafficked.

The report led Republican legislators and conservative news outlets to say that ICE “lost” the children or that they are “missing”. But that is not what it said.

False.

As a US senator in 2018, Kamala Harris criticised the Trump administration’s immigration policies, including a policy that led to family separations at the border. In that context, Harris said US ICE’s function should be re-examined and that “we need to probably even think about starting from scratch.” But Harris did not say there should not be immigration enforcement. In 2018, Harris also said ICE had a role and should exist.

Mostly False. Harris cast the tie-breaking vote on the motion to proceed to a final Senate vote on the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, a coronavirus pandemic relief bill.

An ideologically diverse cross-section of economists agrees that the American Rescue Plan added a couple of percentage points to inflation, but did not cause the wider spike. The primary causes, they say, were supply chain disruptions from the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Year-over-year inflation peaked in 2022 at about 9 percent. That made it the worst annual rate in 40 years, but not the worst in US history.

The $28,000 increase is a credible estimate of the extra amount that households have paid for purchases since Biden took office. But that figure ignores that wage gains have evened out much – or depending on the timeframe, all – of those increased costs.

The statement needs clarification, so we rated itMostly True.

Harris’s history on this topic goes back to when she was California’s attorney general and represented the state’s corrections department as it sought to block a lower court order requiring the agency to provide gender-affirming surgery to a transgender inmate.

During her run for president in the 2019 Democratic primary, Harris said she favoured access to gender-affirming surgery for people in prisons and immigration detention. Harris has not campaigned on this issue in 2024, but when asked about it during a Fox News interview on October 16, she said: “I will follow the law.”

Federal law requires that prisons provide necessary medical care to inmates, and several courts have ruled that gender-affirming care, including surgery, is included. Despite these court rulings, access to gender-affirming surgery in prisons is limited, and the number of transgender prisoners in federal prisons who have received it is minuscule – two.

We found no record of gender-affirming surgeries being provided in immigration detention.

ThisdistortsHarris’s current stance.

As a2019 presidential primary candidate, Harris said: “I support a mandatory gun buyback programme” for assault weapons. She no longer supports this policy, which would not have applied to handguns, the most popular firearms.

The Harris campaign told The New York Times that she supports banning assault weapons but not a requirement to sell them to the federal government. As vice president, Harris has urged states to pass red flag laws and supported federal gun safety legislation that included funding for mental health and school security resources.

There is evidence that she supported a gun ban, but that was limited to one city nearly 20 years ago. In 2005 when Harris was the San Francisco district attorney, she supported a ballot measure that would have banned city residents from owning handguns. Voters approved the measure, but the courts struck it down.

Trump said: “Your crime is through the roof” and that newly released statistics showed that “crime was up 45 percent” under the Biden-Harris administration.

Trump may have meant to say 4.5 percent, a figure that has been cited in some media accounts sympathetic to Trump. But even that lower figure would be misleading.

This comment was part of a discussion by Trump of an exchange he had with ABC News’ David Muir during the September 10 presidential debate in Philadelphia, in which Muir said crime had declined and Trump insisted that crime had risen.

In general, FBI annual data has shown adeclinein violent crime from 2020 to 2023. Multiple nongovernmental crime statistics analyses also found violent crime declined in 2023 and 2024.

In October, it was reported that the FBI had updated its violent crime data to be more complete, a standard annual process. The updated data led some commentators to say this meant crime had increased between 2021 and 2022; rather than being down by 2.1 percent, some said, it was up by 4.5 percnt between those two years, with thousands of new violent crimes.

However, crime experts including Jeff Asher of JH Analytics said this is a statistical artefact.

That is because the baseline for this comparison is the data for 2021, which Asher and other crime experts say isunreliablebecause the FBI switched crime reporting systems that year and compliance by local police departments plummeted. (The problem has been fixed in the annual data for later years.)

Asher described the revisions released in October as unusually large, and for unclear reasons. But he wrote that “the FBI’s 2023 estimates show a continued small decline in violent crime with a historically large decline in murder.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/28/fact-check-donald-trumps-madison-square-garden-rally-in-new-york-city
Donald Trump,What’s Donald Trump’s plan to ‘end’ Russia’s war on Ukraine?,"Donald Trump and Russia — the association goes back to the former president’s first run for the top job in the United States and accusations that the Kremlin worked to help him get into the White House in 2016.

Amid his current re-election campaign, Trump has repeatedly claimed he can quickly put an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, without presenting a detailed plan as the US presidential election draws near.

Hisrunning mate, JD Vance, has now presented — in a podcast — some details about what a second Trump administration vision for Washington’s future role in the conflict would look like.

Let’s take a look at the plan and what it would mean for everyone involved.

The former president has cited US policy towards Ukraine numerous times to blast the Democratic Party leadership, arguing that they have beenfunding and arming a large-scale, open-ended warthat does not benefit the US.

Trump has claimed the war would have never started had he won the 2020 election, and has boasted of being able to end the war “in 24 hours”. He has presented no evidence to support either claim.

During the presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris last week, he said, if elected in November, he would “get it done before even becoming president” in January. But Trump suggested laying out the plan in detail would expose him in negotiations.

“I have a very exacting plan on how to stop Ukraine and Russia. And I have a certain idea, maybe not a plan, but an idea for China,” Trump said last week in a podcast interview with Lex Fridman. He later added: “But I can’t give you those plans because if I give you those plans, I’m not going to be able to use them. They’ll be unsuccessful. Part of it’s surprise.”







But while Trump has been reluctant to share details of his plans to “stop Ukraine and Russia”, his running mate was, recently, more forthcoming.

According to Vance, Trump would start negotiations with the Kremlin, Ukraine and European stakeholders if he wins the election with an eye towards achieving “a peaceful settlement”.

“And what it probably looks like is the current line of demarcation between Russia and Ukraine, that becomes like a demilitarised zone,” he told the Shawn Ryan Show in an episode released last week.

Vance did not discuss the location or the extent of the demilitarised zone, but emphasised that it would be “heavily fortified so the Russians don’t invade again”.

“Ukraine retains its independent sovereignty, Russia gets the guarantee of neutrality from Ukraine – it doesn’t join NATO, it doesn’t join some of these allied institutions. That is what the deal is ultimately going to look something like,” he said.

Vance, a former US marine, said “a lot of risks” would be involved if Washington were to help Ukraine take control of Crimea, which Russia annexed after an offensive in 2014.

“How many American lives would it cost to do that? And if the answer is more than zero then I’m out,” he said.

The prospective future vice president said he believesTrump could reach a deal swiftlybecause “they’re scared of him in Russia, they’re worried about him in Europe because they know he actually means what he says”.

It would be wrong to view the conflict as “the humanitarian mission of our time” and consider it a battle between “good versus evil”, according to Vance, who added Russia “should not have invaded” Ukraine but that “Ukrainians have got a lot of corruption problems too”.







The outlines of the plan presented by Vance appear much closer to the vision presented by Moscow to end the war compared with the one favoured by Ukraine and NATO.

For one, he backs maintaining the current demarcation lines, which would mean that Ukraine would effectively have to cede control of some of its occupied territory.

Within months after starting its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia took control of parts of Ukraine, including areas in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia, holding referendums and installing officials loyal to the Kremlin.

Russia has taken military control of about 20 percent of Ukraine since 2014, stressing that any peace plan would have to recognise “the reality on the ground”.

Ukraine has said any peace deal must invalidate the Russian annexations of all its territory, which would include nullifying the annexation of Crimea and returning it to Kyiv’s control.

Ukraine has also been pushing hard for more funds and weapons, and to become a member of the Western military alliance. NATO has started Kyiv’s membership process,promising an “irreversible path” to enterthe 32-member alliance.

Kyiv wants Russian officials to be prosecuted at an international tribunal as well.

The war between Russia and Ukraine shows no signs of stopping in the foreseeable future regardless of the election rhetoric in the US.

The Kremlin has also expressed pessimism about Trump’s claims of ending the war immediately, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying at the start of September that this sort of thinking falls within “the realm of fantasy”.

Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to be trolling the Harris campaign earlier this month as well,saying Moscow “supports” herand maybe she would not impose further sanctions on Russia.







Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine continue to fight in each other’s territory as the Russian military makes small gains in eastern Ukraine and Ukrainian forces persist with their offensive into the Kursk border region.

Donald Trump,US Election 2024,"Former PresidentDonald Trump’svictory in theUS presidential electionhas been helped in no small part by his winning of multiple so-called “blue wall” states that are traditional Democrat strongholds.

“It appears Trump has breached the blue wall, or at least enough of it, to win the presidency,” David Schultz, an author and political science professor at Minnesota’s Hamline University, told Al Jazeera.

As the Electoral College voting map gradually turned red after polls closed and votes were being counted, observers initially suspected the “red mirage” effect, which can be produced as more Republican voters (denoted by red) tend to go to the polls in person and more Democrats (denoted by blue)mail intheir votes.

Once Trump crossed the line of270 Electoral votes, however, Democratic hopes of catching up to his lead in the early counting stage were dashed.

Historically, moremail-in ballotsare sent by Democrats while more Republicans vote in person.

During the 2020 election, the electoral map looked similarly red in the early hours of counting, leading Trump to claim an early victory, before results in critical battleground states had been announced.

When results concluded after mail-in ballots were counted, DemocratJoe Biden emergedas a winner, after counting of postal votes showed he had won back Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, some of which are blue wall states and all of which had been won by the Republicans in the 2016 election.

Similar blue shifts after an initial red mirage were expected by some analysts this year. However, by 6am ET (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Associated Press (AP) had projected 277 Electoral College votes for Trump, seven more than the 270 required to secure a presidency.

Later on Wednesday, that number ballooned further, after Michigan, one of the so-called blue wall states, was also called for Trump.

A blue wall state is one the Democrats have reliably won through most of US modern history.

Precisely, these are states that voted for Democrats in every election between 1992 and 2012. They include California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Rhode Island, Delaware and Vermont as well as the District of Columbia.

In 2016, Trump breached the blue wall, flipping several of those states to red in the election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. These included Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – all three of which were again major battleground states during the latest election.

In 2020, President Joe Biden won back all three of these states, seemingly resurrecting the blue wall.

Away from the swing states, AP called reliable Harris wins in all the other blue wall states. However, AP called Trump wins in the three critical battleground states behind the blue wall – enough to cost Harris the presidency.

Here is how Trump fared in the three swing states considered to be behind the blue wall this year:

Schultz said he believed Biden was able to reclaim blue wall swing states from Trump in 2020 in part because of the way Trump handled theCOVID-19pandemic during his presidency.

More than 1.1 million people died during the pandemic in the US – from the time of the emergency declaration in January 2020 until when it was lifted inMay 2023.

During the early months of the outbreak, Trump undermined scientists and spreadfalse claimsabout the coronavirus on his social media platforms, such as the idea that children are “almost immune” to it.

Anti-vaccine misinformation spread and people in many Republican-led states started rallying for relaxed quarantine restrictions and questioned mandatory vaccine requirements.

In February 2021, a Lancet commission tasked with assessing Trump’s health policy found that 40 percent of deaths from the virus in the US could have been averted if the US death toll corresponded with that in other high-income Group of Seven (G7) countries.

Now, however, “economic issues along with feelings of being ignored drove the Trump victory”, Schultz said. Democrats “failed to execute well in the three blue wall states”, focusing too much on abortion over other issues such as economic policies that would appeal to working-class voters, he said.

A preliminary national exit poll conducted by data provider Edison Research showed that 51 percent of voters trusted Trump with handling the economy compared with the 47 percent who trusted Harris.

According to the exit poll, 31 percent of voters said the economy mattered most in shaping their decision to vote, whereas only 14 percent cited abortion.

“The Harris campaign did not necessarily do a good job of explaining how her policies would help the middle class, or at least that message wasn’t really resonating with a lot of voters,” Melissa Deckman, a political scientist and the CEO of Public Religion Research Institute, told Reuters news agency.

Deckman added that Harris’s VP choice of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro was one of “several mistakes” made by the Democrats in the run-up to this election. This is because Walz did not help Harris win any swing states. Minnesota has voted blue in every single election since 1976.

In 2016, third-party candidateJill Steinwon 132,000 votes across Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, inroads that are believed to have contributed to Democrat Hillary Clinton losing the race.

So, what cost the Democrats vital blue wall states in this election?

“Harris lost Pennsylvania because she failed to speak to working-class voters and thought abortion would drive enough women to the polls to help her win,” Schultz said.

The Democrats campaigned more heavily on women’s rights issues than the Republicans in this, the first election since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade court ruling and ended a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy all over the US. Laws regarding abortion were effectively returned to individual states to decide.

However, early exit polls released while polling was still continuing showed that Harris had won the support of 54 percent of women in the state – less than Biden did in 2020, when he gained the support of 57 percent of women.

Wisconsin was reliably blue for decades, but Trump defeated Clinton there in 2016 by appealing to largely white, working-class voters who were concerned about rising healthcare costs as well as wages and poverty.

This time, “Harris lost Wisconsin because she lost the working class and did not win women, suburbs and young voters,” Schultz said.

In particular, the opioid crisis in the US – rampant addiction and overuse of prescription opioids and illegal opioids such as heroin – has badly rattled Wisconsin, where multiple polls this year suggested that healthcare had become a key issue for voters in the state.

According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the opioid epidemic in Wisconsin started more than two decades ago because there was overprescription of medical opioids and because heroin, an illegal opioid, had become cheaper and more widely available. In 2022, 1,828 people in Wisconsin died of a drug overdose, more than double the number from 2015. The synthetic opioid fentanyl was found in 73 percent of all overdose deaths in Wisconsin, according to a state attorney’s office report in August 2024.

Harris ran on the promise that she would lower the cost of pharmaceutical drugs and cancel medical debt as well as bolster the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which provides health insurance to middle and low-income Americans. Trump, on the other hand, said he would find an alternative to the ACA.

Michigan was not considered a swing state before 2016 because it did not flip-flop between the two parties – from 1976 to 1988, Republicans always won in Michigan. However, the presidential contest in Michigan has always been competitive.

In the second edition of his 2019 book, Presidential Swing States, analyst Rafael Jacob also wrote that since 1980, the winner in Michigan has always been the overall election winner, with just two exceptions – George W Bush in 2000 and 2004.

Jacob added that even when voters in Michigan chose Democratic presidents, they voted for Republican governors in state-level elections, concluding that Michigan voters are not very partisan.

During this election, Israel’s war on Gaza has emerged as akey issuein Michigan. According to the World Population Review, Michigan is the US state with the highest number of Arab Americans – 211,225 – as of this year, and there are an estimated 2.1 million Arab Americans in total in the US.

These voters expressed discontent with Trump and Harris since both candidates have expressed unequivocal support for Israel in its war on Gaza, which began on October 7, 2023 after a Hamas-led assault on villages and army outposts in southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,139 people and the capture of 251. Since the war began, at least 43,391 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardments and ground assaults in Gaza, while many thousands more are lost and presumed dead under the rubble.

Many Arab Americans instead said theywould vote for Jill Stein, this year’s presidential nominee for the Green Party, who campaigned on the promise of pushing for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and holding Israel accountable to international law.

The Democrats, as well as European Green Party members, warned that Steinwould dent the Democrat vote, enabling Trump to win swing states and hence, the presidency.

Between October 30 and October 31, she was polling at 1.7 percent in Michigan, 1 percent in Wisconsin and 0.8 percent in Pennsylvania, according to Brazil-based analytics and data intelligence website AtlasIntel.

In Michigan, she won 0.8 percent of the vote, as well as 0.5 percent of the vote in Pennsylvania and 0.4 percent in Wisconsin.

In Michigan, Stein and other third-party candidates combined won 2 percent of the popular vote, or 109,777 votes, based on the count so far. In the state, Trump defeated Harris by: 81, 750 votes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/7/us-election-results-how-did-donald-trump-break-the-blue-wall
Donald Trump,"Trump says Putin wants peace in Ukraine, will begin talks on ending war","United States President Donald Trump has signalled a major shift in three years of US policy towards Kyiv, saying that he and Russian leader Vladimir Putin hadspoken by phoneand agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine.

Trump said he spent more than an hour on the phone with Putin on Wednesday, and “I think we’re on the way to getting peace”.

He noted that he later spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but he was noncommittal about whether Ukraine would be an equal participant in US negotiations with Russia on ending the war.

“I think President Putin wants peace and President Zelenskyy wants peace and I want peace,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

Recounting his call with Putin, Trump said: “People didn’t really know what President Putin’s thoughts were. But I think I can say with great confidence, he wants to see it ended also, so that’s good – and we’re going to work toward getting it ended and as fast as possible.”

The US president said they had agreed to “work together very closely, including visiting each other’s nations” and to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately” on Ukraine.

Trump said that he would “probably” meet in person with Putin in the near term, suggesting that a meeting could take place in Saudi Arabia.

Asked specifically about Ukraine being an equal member in apotential peace process, Trump responded, “Interesting question. I think they have to make peace.”







Trump’s conversation with Putin may also signal that Washington and Moscow could work to hammer out a deal to end fighting in Ukraine by going around Kyiv, a development that would break with the previous Biden administration, which had steadfastly insisted that Ukraine’s leadership would be a full participant in any decisions made.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy appeared to put on a brave face saying that Trump had informed him of his conversation with Putin and that he appreciated the US president’s “genuine interest in our shared opportunities and how we can bring about a real peace together”.

“We believe that America’s strength, together with Ukraine and all of our partners, is enough to push Russia to peace,” he later wrote on social media.

I had a long and detailed conversation with President Trump. I appreciate his genuine interest in our shared opportunities and how we can bring about real peace together.

We discussed many aspects—diplomatic, military, and economic—and President Trump informed me about what…pic.twitter.com/flmigxqtbl

NATO chief Mark Rutte said Ukraine must be involved in peace talks and any final deal needs to be “enduring”.

“Of course, this is crucial – [when] we talk about Ukraine, that Ukraine is closely involved in everything happening about Ukraine,” Rutte told journalists ahead of a meeting of alliance defence ministers.

Mariia Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, warned the importance of the call for ending the conflict should not be overstated.

“Trump is not following his presidential electoral promises, where he said he would be putting pressure on both sides,” Zolkina told Al Jazeera. “We don’t see any pressure on Russia but rather sympathising and soft rhetoric about finding the common ground.

“This doesn’t make Russia interested in any solution, even in a ceasefire,” she said.

Earlier, in another blow to Kyiv, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at NATO headquarters in Brussels that Ukraine’s ambition to join NATO was unrealistic.

“We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said at the NATO meeting.

“Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he said.

Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and it is still considered occupied territory by Ukraine and many Western countries.

Hegseth said any durable peace must include “robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again”. But he said US troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of such guarantees.

Trump said later about NATO membership for Ukraine: “I don’t think it’s practical to have it, personally.”

Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Biden administration joined other NATO members in declaring that Kyiv’s membership in the Western military alliance was “inevitable”.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the conversation between Trump and Putin covered a good deal of ground, including the Middle East and Iran, but that Ukraine was the main focus.







Peskov said Trump had called for a quick cessation of hostilities and a peaceful settlement, and that “President Putin, in his turn, emphasised the need to remove the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peace talks”.

“The Russian president supported one of the main theses of the US president that the time has come for our two countries to work together,” Peskov told reporters.

“The Russian president invited the US president to visit Moscow and expressed readiness to host US officials in Russia for issues of mutual interest, naturally including Ukraine, the Ukrainian settlement.”

German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was “regrettable” Trump’s administration had made “concessions” to Russia before peace talks on Ukraine had even started.

“In my view, it would have been better to speak about a possible NATO membership for Ukraine or possible losses of territory at the negotiating table,” Pistorius said ahead of the NATO meeting.

France’s defence minister warned that NATO faces a moment of reckoning on its future.

“It’s a crucial moment of truth,” Sebastien Lecornu told reporters ahead of the same meeting in Brussels. “People call it the most important, the strongest military alliance in history. That’s historically true – but the question is, will it still be true 10 or 15 years from now.”

Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was in Kyiv on Wednesday on the first visit by a member of Trump’s cabinet amid reports that Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with Trump for continued US military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine’s mineral industry.

Trump has suggested that aid to Ukraine would continue to flow, but the treasury secretary was in Ukraine working to get written assurances that the US would get access to its rare earth elements and oil and gas.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/13/trump-says-putin-wants-peace-will-begin-talks-on-ending-ukraine-war
Donald Trump,Can Donald Trump seek a third term – and what are his options?,"Donald Trump on Sunday said he was “not joking” about the possibility of seeking a third term as president of the United States, even though the US Constitution bars presidents from being elected more than twice.

“There are methods which you could do it,” Trump said when asked if he was serious, in an interview with NBC News. One such method, he hinted, could involve Vice President JD Vance running in 2028 and stepping down if elected, to allow Trump to take over.

“But there are others too,” he added, without elaborating. “A lot of people want me to do it.”

The remark set off a wave of alarm and speculation, especially because this wasn’t the first time he has floated the idea.

So, can he really do this? And what are his options?

Trump has repeatedly hinted at staying in power beyond two terms.

In 2018, at a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago – his Florida resort-cum-home – Trump referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s indefinite term in office and joked: “Maybe we’ll give that a shot someday.”

During campaign rallies, he has said his supporters might demand he serve a third term, once referring to it as “reparations” for being investigated over Russian interference. In 2020, he said in a social media post that the “election should be delayed until people can properly, securely and safely vote”, again raising fears he might attempt to overstay his term.

Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, has also made public statements suggesting that Trump and his aides have explored unconventional ways to hold onto power.

In a recent interview, Bannon predicted that Trump would run and win again in 2028.

“I think he is going to run again in 2028 and I think he is going to win,” Bannon said. “I think we’ll have a couple of alternatives,” he said about ways in which Trump could seek a third term despite constitutional limits.

Whether this is strategy or just politics as usual, it highlights a recurring theme in Trump’s narrative, which is testing the boundaries of the US Constitution.







The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified in 1951, states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”

The language appears straightforward, capping the number of presidential elections a person can win at two.

But some of Trump’s allies argue that it leaves room for interpretation – specifically, that while a person cannot be elected more than twice, it might still be possible to become president through succession rather than election.

Prior to Franklin D. Roosevelt, no president had served more than two terms – a tradition started by George Washington and respected for more than 150 years.

But Roosevelt was elected four times, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. In response, legislators moved to pass the 22nd Amendment, which was ratified by the states in 1951. The goal was to codify the two-term tradition and prevent any future president from holding office for more than two terms.

The most commonly discussed loophole involves Trump running as vice president in 2028. If a Republican is elected president and then resigns, dies, or is removed from office, Trump could theoretically succeed to the presidency.

This concept is based on a narrow reading of the 22nd Amendment, which bars a person from being elected more than twice – not from serving more than two terms. Supporters of this theory argue that the amendment might not prohibit Trump from becoming president through the line of succession.

Some legal scholars reject this as a viable option, including constitutional law expert Bruce Fein.

“There are zero constitutional methods to circumvent the 22nd Amendment,” Fein told Al Jazeera.

Fein warned that if Trump seeks to go against the 22nd Amendment, there might be few other limits the president sticks to, in his bid to hold on to power.

“Trump hopes to torch the Constitution and coronate himself as king in the manner of Napoleon’s… self-coronation as Emperor in 1804,” Fein said. “If Trump flouts the 22nd Amendment, he will have no scruples defying court orders … summoning the military to arrest and imprison judges, legislators, and political opponents.”

One specific limitation on Trump using the wording of the 22nd Amendment as a loophole? The 12th Amendment, say some scholars.







The 12th Amendment states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.”

In plain terms, if Trump is no longer eligible to be president, having already served two terms, then he cannot be vice president either, according to the dominant interpretation of this amendment.

“Trump would also be barred from running for VP under the 12th Amendment because he would be ineligible for the presidency,” Fein confirmed.

Courts might therefore interpret Trump’s nomination as vice president as a direct violation of constitutional intent.

In theory, yes. But it’s extremely unlikely.

Revoking the 22nd Amendment would require a constitutional amendment: Two-thirds support in both the House and Senate, followed by ratification from three-fourths of state legislatures (38 out of 50 states).

Currently, Republicans control only about 28 state legislatures – far short of the required number. In Congress, Trump’s party does not have the necessary two-thirds support in either chamber.

Technically, yes, argue some lawyers.

If Trump were elected as VP, the president he is elected under might not even need to resign for Trump to effectively lead the nation, Cornerstone Law, a Pennsylvania-based law firm, suggested in an article a few months ago. In theory, if the president were temporarily incapacitated, Trump could serve as “acting president” under the 25th Amendment.

The argument again hinges on the fact that the 22nd Amendment bars being elected more than twice – not necessarily holding the office again through other means.

Still, the Cornerstone article also admits that this interpretation is legally untested and would likely face major challenges.

Other options, like Trump entering the presidential line of succession through a Cabinet appointment, for instance, have also been floated, but would again require navigating serious constitutional and political roadblocks.

He could also serve as an unofficial “shadow president” in a future administration, holding huge political sway without the official title.

But even then, courts would likely consider the overall purpose of the 22nd Amendment – which was to limit how long someone can stay in power in any form after two terms.

Still, Fein said Trump’s rhetoric and intentions should not be dismissed as mere trolling.

“Except for the somnolent, Trump is setting the stage to light a match to the constitutional order,” he said.

Ultimately, the law is only as strong as the public’s willingness to uphold it, he said. It is what people are willing to “fight and die for”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/1/can-donald-trump-seek-a-third-term-and-what-are-his-options
Donald Trump,Trump’s ‘shithole’ remarks spur international anger,"International organisations including the UN and African Union, politicians and people from African countries and Caribbeans are outraged over US PresidentDonald Trump‘s latest racist remarks.

The president criticised immigration to his country fromEl Salvador, Haiti and the African continent, by calling the group “shithole countries”, according to the US media.









“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” Trump asked at a meeting with congress members at the White House, reports said on Thursday, citing people with knowledge on the conversation.

Trump suggested theUSshould instead focus its immigrant entry policy on countries such as Norway.

These are racist comments. He has said things like this before when he talked about Nigerians who won't go back to live in huts and he talked about Haitians who bring AIDS to the United States. These are all confirmations of what a lot of people have long suspected - that he harbours racism

byBill Schneider, Washington, DC-based political analyst

Rupert Colville, spokesman of the UN human rights office, said: “You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as shitholes … I’m sorry, but there’s no other word one can use but racist.”

Colville added the story wasn’t “just a story about vulgar language, it’s about opening the door to humanity’s worst side”.

The African Union said it was “frankly alarmed”.

“Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behaviour and practice,” said AU spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo.

Haiti‘s government said Trump’s reported comments shows a “racist view of the Haitian community”, whileEl Salvador sent a formal letter of protest to the US saying Trumphad “implicitly” accepted the use of “harsh terms detrimental to the dignity of El Salvador and other countries”.

Trump denied the racist remarks, tweeting on Friday that the language he used “was tough, but this was not the language used”, as he called for a “merit-based system of immigration and people who take our country to the next level”.

He later tweeted that he has “never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously a very poor and troubled country”.

But Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator who attended the meeting, disputed Trump’s account.

“He said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly,” Durbin told reporters.

Trump questioned why the US should accept more immigrants from Haiti, Durbin said, adding that “shitholes” was the “exact word” the US leader used to describe countries in Africa.

The White House did not directly challenge the authenticity of Trump’s comments, but issued a statement saying: “Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people.”

Rene Civil, an activist in Haiti, said that Trump is “destabilising, a president who uses vulgar words, who is unacceptable”.

Civil added: “We [Haitians] demand that Donald Trump apologise [to] the entire African continent, as well as before Haiti, a country whose blood has been used by ancestors who have used their minds and bodies to liberate the United States itself from slavery”.

South Africa‘s ruling ANC party said Trump’s comments were “extremely offensive”, with a spokeswoman saying the party would never deign to make such derogatory remarks.

Morocco-based Africa analyst Adama Gaye told Al Jazeera: “Trump has shown a continuous display of racism towards Africa [and people from poor nations].”

Abdulsalam Kayode, a resident of theNigeria‘s capital Lagos, told Al Jazeera that the US president’s comments are “not unexpected from somebody of this nature [because] we already know this kind of person”.

Commenting on the invitation to Norwegians, Washington DC-based political analyst Bill Schneider told Al Jazeera: “That’s the racist element. Norwegians are white, they’re northern Europeans. He was referring earlier, in his vulgar comment, to [people of] African descent.

“These are racist comments. He has said things like this before when he talked about Nigerians who won’t go back to live in huts and he talked about Haitians who bring AIDS to the United States. These are all confirmations of what a lot of people have long suspected – that he harbours racism.”

Many took to social media to condemn the president, including members of his own Republican party.

Republican politician Mia Love, who is of Haitian descent, said: “The president’s comments are unkind, divisive, elitist and fly in the face of our nation’s values.”

Donald Trump,Trump says he’ll decide on name of ‘Persian Gulf’ on Middle East visit,"United States President Donald Trump has said he will make a decision on how the US refers to the “Persian Gulf” during an upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he expected his hosts to ask about the name the US uses for the waterway during his first trip to the Middle East since retaking the White House.

“I’ll have to make a decision,” Trump said in response to a question about whether he would make an announcement on the body of water’s name.

“I don’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings. I don’t know if feelings are going to be hurt.”

“I’m going to be given a briefing on that and I’ll make a decision,” Trump added.

Trump’s comments came after US media reported that he plans to use the May 13-16 trip to announce that the US will begin referring to the body of water as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia.

The name of the waterway has long been a source of tensions between Arab nations and Iran.

Iran argues that the “Persian Gulf” is the appropriate name in light of historical evidence, including ancient maps, that shows it is part of its territory.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and other Arab states use the term “Arabian Gulf” or “the Gulf”.

In 2023, Tehran summoned the Iraqi ambassador to protest his country’s use of the name “Arabian Gulf Cup” for the region’s flagship football tournament.

In 2012, Iran threatened to sue internet giant Google for leaving the waterway nameless on its online map services.

Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi condemned the latest suggestions of a name change as “indicative of hostile intent toward Iran and its people”, and warned that such a move would “only bring the wrath of all Iranians from all walks of life”.

“Such biased actions are an affront to all Iranians, regardless of their background or place of residence,” Araghchi said in a post on X early on Thursday.

The name Persian Gulf, like many geographical designations, is deeply rooted in human history. Iran has never objected to the use of names such as the Sea of Oman, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, or Red Sea. The use of these names does not imply ownership by any particular nation, but…pic.twitter.com/PQjUiph4qt

“Let’s hope that the absurd rumours about the PERSIAN Gulf that are going around are no more than a disinformation campaign by ‘forever warriors’ to anger Iranians all over the world and agitate them.”

In one of his first actions as president, Trump in January signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/8/trump-says-hell-decide-on-name-of-persian-gulf-on-middle-east-visit
Donald Trump,"World reacts after Donald Trump, JD Vance berate Ukraine’s Zelenskyy","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’smeetingwith United States President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, ended abruptly after the two leaders clashed in a heated exchange over Russia’s war against Kyiv.

At the Oval Office on Friday, Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy for being “disrespectful” and not thanking the US enough for its support.

“You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people,”Trump shouted. “You’re gambling with World War III, and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country – this country.”

Zelenskyy, who was meeting with Trump to convince him not to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin and discuss possible US security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, told Trump that there would be “no compromises with a killer on our territory”.

As the Ukrainian leader left the White House shortly after the verbal match, Trump took to the Truth Social social media app, which he owns, to write that Zelenskyy was not “ready for peace if America is involved”.

“He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace,” he added.

Zelenskyy posted on X after the meeting to thank the US for its support.

“Thank you POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,” he wrote.

Here is how some world leaders reacted to the heated dispute:

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Zelenskyy to prioritise a rare earth minerals deal over security guarantees or a ceasefire with Russia.

“I talked to Zelenskyy this morning – don’t take the bait. President Trump was in a very good mood last night,” Graham said outside the White House.

A vocal Ukraine supporter and Trump ally, Graham called the meeting an “utter disaster” and questioned future US dealings with Zelenskyy. “I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again,” he said, adding that the Ukrainian president should apologise to Trump or for Ukraine to “get someone new” to lead the country.

Top Democratic leaders condemned Trump’s handling of the talks. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused him of doing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “dirty work”, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the exchange “appalling”.

“The United States must not reward Russian aggression,” Jeffries said. “We should stand with Ukraine until victory is won.”



Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of the Russian Security Council, wrote on Telegram that Trump had given Ukraine a “strong slap on the wrist”.

“For the first time, Trump told the cocaine clown the truth to his face: The Kyiv regime is playing with the Third World War. And the ungrateful pig received a strong slap on the wrist from the owners of the pigsty. This is useful. But it’s not enough – we must stop military aid to the Nazi machine,” said Medvedev, who is also a former Russian president.

Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also praised Trump for showing “restraint” with the Ukrainian leader, whom she called a “scumbag”.

“I think Zelenskyy’s biggest lie of all his lies was his assertion in the White House that the Kyiv regime in 2022 was alone, without support,” she wrote on Telegram. “How Trump and Vance held back from hitting that scumbag is a miracle of restraint.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola all told Zelenskyy in a joint post: “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless.

“We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.”

The bloc’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, meanwhile, said it was clear that “the free world needs a new leader.”

“Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine,” she said in a social media post.

“We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back [against] the aggressor,” she added. “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”

French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters in Portugal that Russia is the “aggressor” in the Ukraine war and Ukrainians are the “aggressed people”.

“I think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago, and to continue to do so. We, that is the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others,” Macron said.

“And we must thank all those who have helped and respect those who have been fighting since the beginning. Because they are fighting for their dignity, their independence, their children and the security of Europe. These are simple things, but they’re good to remember at times like these, that’s all,” he added.

Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, “Ukraine can rely on Germany and on Europe.”

“No one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine! That is why we are jointly seeking the path to a lasting and just peace,” he said.

Friedrich Merz, expected to be Germany’s next chancellor, addressed Zelenskyy on X, stating: “We stand with Ukraine in good and in testing times. We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.”

Johann Wadephul, a top legislator from Merz’s party, also backed Ukraine.

“The scenes from the White House are shocking,” he wrote on X. “How can you stab the president of an invaded country in the back like this? Free Europe will not betray Ukraine!”

Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with both Trump and Zelenskyy following their public fallout.

According to a Downing Street statement, Starmer said he is looking forward to “hosting international leaders on Sunday, including President Zelenskyy”.

“He retains his unwavering support for Ukraine and is playing his part to find a path forward to a lasting peace, based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine,” the statement said.

Prime Minister Micheal Martin said Ireland stands with Ukraine, recalling his visits to the country: “When I met with President Zelenskyy yesterday, I reiterated our full support for a just, durable and sustained peace.”

Foreign Minister Simon Harris stressed that Ukraine is not responsible for the war, stating: “Ukraine is not to blame for this war brought about by Russia’s illegal invasion. We stand with Ukraine.”







NATO chief Mark Rutte told the BBC that the Ukrainian president must “find a way” to restore his relationship with Trump.

Rutte said he talked to Zelenskyy and told him: “You have to find a way, dear Volodymyr, to restore your relationship with Donald Trump and the American administration.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will continue to stand with Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace.

“Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine. For three years now, Ukrainians have fought with courage and resilience. Their fight for democracy, freedom, and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all,” he wrote on X.

Foreign Minister Melanie Joly encouraged NATO allies to band together “amidst all this unpredictability and sometimes even chaos”.

“We believe in supporting Ukraine. Our position has not changed. We think Ukrainians are fighting for their own freedoms, but they’re also fighting for ours,” she said.

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere condemned the events in the White House as “serious and disheartening”.

“Ukraine still needs the US’s support, and Ukraine’s security and future are also important to the US and to Europe.

“President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has strong support in Ukraine, broad support in Europe, and he has led his people through a very demanding and brutal time, under attack from Russia. That Trump accuses Zelenskyy of gambling with World War III is deeply unreasonable and a statement I distance myself from,” he said in a statement to Norwegian TV2.

Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen described recent events as a setback for Kyiv. Writing on Facebook, he said, “It’s a punch in the gut for Ukraine. … There must be room for robust conversations – even between friends. But when it happens in front of rolling cameras like that, there is only one winner. And he sits in the Kremlin.”

Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on X:

“Sweden stands with Ukraine. You are not only fighting for your freedom but also for all of Europe’s. Slava Ukraini!”

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo reaffirmed Finland’s commitment to Ukraine, pledging “our unwavering support and work towards a just and lasting peace”.

Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp reiterated his backing for Ukraine, saying he had spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha. “I reiterated my full support for Ukraine: whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,” he said.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X: “Dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.”

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also expressed solidarity with Ukraine.

“Ukraine, Spain stands with you,” he wrote on X.

Prime Minister Luis Montenegro assured: “Ukraine can always count on Portugal.”

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni proposed a meeting between the US and European leaders to reaffirm their bonds.

“A summit without delay is needed between the United States, European states and their allies to talk frankly about how we intend to tackle today’s major challenges, starting with Ukraine, which together we have defended in recent years,” Meloni, a right-wing leader, said in a statement.

Her deputy meanwhile expressed support for Trump. “Aim for PEACE, stop this war! Come on @realDonaldTrump”, Matteo Salvini wrote on X.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban was among the few voices in Europe that backed Trump.

“Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace,” he wrote on X. “Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!”

He later called on the EU to open direct talks with Moscow to end the Ukraine war and signalled it would oppose a bloc-wide agreement on the conflict at an upcoming summit, according to a letter obtained by AFP.

“I am convinced that the European Union – following the example of the United States – should enter into direct discussions with Russia on a ceasefire and a sustainable peace in Ukraine,” Orban wrote to Antonio Costa, who heads the Council of the EU’s 27 member states.

Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna wrote on X that the only obstacle to peace was President Putin’s “decision to continue his war of aggression”.

“If Russia stops fighting, there will be no war. If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine. Estonia’s support to Ukraine remains unwavering. Time for Europe to step up,” Tsahkna wrote.

President Gitanas Nauseda expressed solidarity, writing: “Ukraine, you’ll never walk alone.”

Prime Minister Evika Silina reaffirmed her country’s support, saying Latvia stands with Ukraine.

President Petr Pavel wrote on X: “We stand with Ukraine more than ever. Time for Europe to step up its efforts.”

Prime Minister Petr Fiala declared: “We stand with Ukraine and on the side of the free world.”

President Natasa Pirc Musar condemned the events in the Oval Office, warning they undermined international law and diplomacy. “We stand firmly in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty. We repeat, Russia is the aggressor. It is time for Europe to take the lead on the path to peace in Ukraine,” wrote Musar on X.

President Maia Sandu wrote on X: “The truth is simple. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is the aggressor. Ukraine defends its freedom – and ours. We stand with Ukraine.”

Prime Minister Luc Frieden assured Ukraine of his country’s support, saying: “You are fighting for your freedom and a rules-based international order.”

Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said Croatia understands Ukraine’s struggle, noting: “Croatia knows from its own experience that only a just peace can last.” He added that Ukraine needs a peace that guarantees “sovereignty, territorial integrity and a secure Europe”.

Romania’s interim President Ilie Bolojan stressed Ukraine’s importance to European security, stating: “The security of Ukraine is crucial for the security of Europe. We all need to stand together to fight for our values, freedom, and peace.”

Austria’s caretaker Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg reaffirmed his support for Ukraine, while the country’s foreign ministry declared: “Russia is the aggressor and we share Ukraine’s commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace!”

Prime Minister Bart De Wever pledged solidarity with Ukraine, stating: “We stand behind Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their historic fight to defend themselves against an unprovoked Russian aggression. Their fight is our fight. United we are strong.”

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement: “We will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, because this is the struggle of a democratic nation versus an authoritarian regime led by Vladimir Putin, who clearly has imperialistic designs, not just on Ukraine, but throughout that region.”

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said his country remains “steadfast in its support for Ukraine as it defends itself in a war that Russia started”, adding that Ukraine is not only protecting its sovereignty but also upholding international law.

Amnesty International stressed that peace in Ukraine must be built on justice for those responsible for war crimes.

“Nothing that was said today in the Oval Office changes the facts: Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was an act of aggression and a manifest violation of the UN Charter,” the rights group said in a social media post.

It added that “sustainable peace in Ukraine is only possible through justice and accountability for all crimes under international law committed since 2014.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/world-reacts-after-donald-trump-jd-vance-berate-ukaines-zelenskyy
Donald Trump,Donald Trump: A president swallowed by history,"US PresidentDonald Trumpis a great impersonator. Not a day goes by without his desperate effort to masquerade as human. Surrounded by faux gold and fawning fools from his earliest days, Trump has stumbled from scam to scam, bank to bank, grope to grope, as he reached the absolute pinnacle of moral failure. His is a world of cheap thrills, empty rhetoric and intimidating context.

Few of knowledge would stop to challenge Trump’s unprecedented scorecard of international failure. Indeed, ad hoc chaos has become very much the executive order of his day.









Whether it’s aMuslim banthat targets states from which not a single national has engaged in an act of terrorism that has cost the life of a US citizen, to hisretweetsof videos posted by a British far-right activist,to apointless border wallstyled on hateful votes and little else, to aproposal to seizeIraqi oil as “spoils of war”, his is a hustler’s hustle. It’s the penultimate Ponzi scheme, a boiler-room operation based in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

The life of Donald Trump is a full-time campaign to disguise incompetence to the roar of the inept. While the spectre of nuclear holocaust on the Korean Peninsula, military threats to Iran, and attacks on the domestic political aspirations and independence of Venezuela and Cuba may empower those who draw vigour from the echo of empty words, they do little but confound a world built on fragile relations and nuanced exchange. To be sure, they present a clear and real danger to us all.

Those foolish enough to believe the arrival of the Romanovs of Fifth Avenue would herald a tempering of US imperial ambitions were soon disappointed.

Thus, inYemen, having been empowered to act on its own, the Pentagon unleasheddrone slaughtersof mostly civilians at an unprecedented pace. From offshore, the USfireddozens of Tomahawk missiles intoSyriaas an offset toa suspected chemical weapons attack.InAfghanistan, we saw thedetonationof the world’s largest non-nuclear bomb as very much a herald to more US troops and to permanent US warfare.

With reckless abandon, Trump has fled from international agreements designed to give hope to the prospect of life for us all long after the debacle of his imperial design comes to its well-deserved end.

The Paris Climate Agreement became the first victim, with the USdepartingas the only country in the world indifferent to a global call for adoption of clean energy and the phase-out of fossil fuels.With damning nationalist praise, Trumpannouncedto the world he “was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris”.

Not long after his coronation, he withdrew fromtheTrans-Pacific Partnershiptrade deal, distancing the US from what were its Asian economic allies. Later, citing its allegedanti-Israel bias, hewithdrewfromUNESCO, which the US helped found in the shadow of World War II. Can it be long before the US abandons a nuclear arms-control agreement that has long been, verifiably, working?

Unsurprisingly, Trump’sglobal “no confidence” ratesoared to 74 percent.

Cast in the light of a presidency certain to soon enter its second year of crude dysfunction, why is anyone, at all, surprised by Trump’s empty, lawlessannouncementthat the US will hereinafter recognise Jerusalem as thecapital of Israel?

Like the wall for which Mexico will pay, at day’s end, Trump’s apostolic blessingwas little more than a “sham show in waiting”, to offer up to a powerful Zionist lobby and ignorant evangelical political base when needed.

Indeed, having shown no understanding of thehistory or complexityof today’s world, let alone core values of international law, Trump’s gratuitous toss of “legitimacy” to the illegitimate journey of Israel was as predictable as it was desperate.

Any discussion of Trump’s mindless recent croon about a world-defining moment of 70-plus years, reduced to presidential fiat, alone, must necessarily begin from the reality of international law. To bestow upon an occupation force lawful annexation of land not theirs for the taking is, ultimately, to do little more than insist that the world is flat.

In 1948, when the United Nations recognised Israel as a state, it called for a demilitarisedJerusalemas a separate entity under the protection of its exclusive aegis.

Not long thereafter, pursuant toResolution 194 (III), the General Assembly declared Jerusalem to be an open city subject to the well-recognised legal principle of internationalisation.

Predictably, not long thereafter, Israel declared Jerusalem to be its capital as it established various government agencies in the western part of the city.

Meanwhile,Jordancontinued to exercise formal control of Jerusalem’s eastern section, including, most importantly, the Old City, leaving open its ultimate status to a final settlement of the unresolved “question” of Palestinian statehood.

All was to radically change as Israel seized and occupied the entire West Bank of Palestine, includingEast Jerusalem, during the war of 1967, thus rendering it subject to the various protections of the Geneva Convention.

In relevant part, the convention holds it unlawful for an occupying power to transfer its own population into the territory it occupies. In addition, it prohibits the establishment of settlements and the confiscation and annexation of occupied land.

Time and time again, the United Nations, as a toothless organisation, has ordered Israel to cease its expansion ofillegal settlementsand annexation of occupied Palestinian land.

Time and time again, Israel, as a rogue state, has scoffed at the notion that it owes any obligation whatsoever to well-settled international law.

Indeed, between1967 and 1989, the UN Security Council adopted131 resolutionsdirectly addressing the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Israel held itself out as beyond the reach of these resolutions.

In 1980, and again in 1990, pursuant toResolutions 478 and 672, the UN demanded that Israel abide by the Geneva Convention and end the construction of illegal settlements. In doing so, it emphasised the “independence” of the City of Jerusalem and the protection of its “unique spiritual and religious dimension”. Israel ignored this demand.

In February 1999, the Security Council again rebuked Israel’s effort as an occupying power “… to alter the character, legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem”.Israelignored this demand.

In point of fact, as of 2015, Israelhad been condemned in, and had ignored, some 45 resolutions by theUnited Nations Human Rights Council.

Anyone with even a modicum of historical context, let alone intellectual capacity or interest, would understand that a now seven-decade-old, deadly standoff betweenPalestineand Israel will not go away by wishful thinking or inane talismanic chant.

Yet that is precisely what Donald Trump did when, with typical denial, he preached on a faux resolution, took credit, and then, with alarming ease, said, “Problem solved … next”.

Ultimately, in a strange sort of way, and in more ways than one, Trump’s unearned arrogance and dramatic disconnect from the crossroads of history and reality may have produced results clearly unintended, yet, necessary.

For decades, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has toiled under the well-financed illusion that the Israelis who sat across the negotiation table, and their enablers in Washington, brought more than just the appearance of goodwill to the effort.

Time after time, outrage after outrage, the PA has always returned with hat in hand to the folly of talks which accomplished little, but provided an irrelevant political vent as more and more land was annexed, and lives stolen, to the hum of bombs or the slam of prison doors.

Palestinian technocrats who started out in their prime with Oslo have now aged beyond hope, along with any illusion of relevance. So, too, the march of time leaves no doubt that Oslo has represented nothing but a palpable pretext for Israel to carry out systematic ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, be it by force of arms or by law.

In the years since Yasser Arafat posed withYitzhak Rabin and renounced armed struggle,three US presidents have come and gone. Each has sold a perverse balance that the US could, somehow, play objective arbiter in the midst of a one-sided slaughter supported, all the while, by US politics and money.

However, do give Donald Trump credit where credit is due. With one, short, slurred speech, he peeled away, forever more, the veneer of any US integrity or independence when it comes to facilitating a just and equitable resolution, respecting the rights and aspirations of Palestinians.

Oslo is a failed, futile fantasy that has filled the coffers of the few while the many have suffered from an economic strangle-hold dressed up in institutional benevolence that, in reality, has been used primarily by the PA to buy and control political winds and opposition.

Any reasonable read must lead to the conclusion that the long terminally-ill Oslo has died, along with its whimsical two-state solution, when Trump, essentially, told the PA to shut its doors and walk away.

Hopefully, 82-year-oldMahmoud Abbasgot the message loud and clear.

It is well past reality’s reach that a two-state solution can, at this late date, provide a viable vehicle for meaningful Palestinian sovereignty or for overall peace.

The notion that a series of disconnected Bantustans – stripped of a traditional land base, natural resources, and the unique centre of religious and faith-based history – can suddenly become a feasible independent state for millions of stateless Palestinians is fool’s gold.

Ultimately, no matter what its form or shape, the essence of statehood is the ability to develop and maintain political and economic institutions and security and to control borders, including air rights and, where applicable, seaports.

To suggest that Israel would cede any degree of meaningful self-determination, in these all-defining cornerstones of sovereignty, to a Palestinian state is simply laughable, in light of its decades-long practices.

Indeed, at this late date, there is but one solutionacceptable tothe millions of Palestinian living as refugees abroad or suffering under apartheid, occupation and ethnic cleansing fueled by supremacist hate: one state for all from the river to the sea.

It matters not whether this state becomes a system of independent, but connected, cantons – as in Switzerland. What is important is that the single state embraces no official state religion, ensures equal protection and rights for all, guarantees “one person, one vote”, and opens all jobs, roads and communities. What is also important is that it is based not on race, religion or politics but on the willingness to struggle for a collective good that will at long last serve the united interest of one people.

While some will surely scoff at this notion and, perhaps, find little hope for its success, unification provides the sole means by which Palestinians and Jews, Muslims and Christians can begin to heal the wounds that have long divided people that, left to their own unimpeded devices, would find much more that unites them than divides.

Lest there be any claim of naivete, the road to a one-state resolution is, of course, littered with more than mere encumbrances of communities, schools and highways long segregated by barricades and barbed wire.

Seventy years of forced displacement, death and destruction have left, for many, the scars born of tears and hate. Only time and unification can begin to heal those wounds and end the nightmare. All else is just sheer destructive folly.

For Israelis, who see delay as their ally, it’s a false hope born of little more than convenient denial. “Out of sight, out of mind” does not solve a crisis but simply puts off its reckoning to another day – one which grows more difficult and demanding with the passage of time.

All occupations, large and small, ultimately awaken one day to find themselves captive to a “graveyard of empires”. Here, it will be no different.

Today, in Palestine and in Israel, there are more than 5 million Palestinians with the median age of19 years. They will not go away or surrender to the silence of the night.

For years, the young women and men of Palestine have been in the vanguard of an unbroken national effort to reclaim their freedom and rebuild their state.

For them, the price has been dear.According to the Palestinian Ministry of Information, since 2000, alone, Israel haskilledmorethan 3,000 Palestinian minors. During the same period, Israeliforces have injured another 13,000 youth and arrested more than 12,000 others. Today, Israel holds about 300 children in its prisons.

Despite an awful price exacted for their courage and resistance, for the young women and men of Palestine, the future holds no truth but one, built on a determined struggle to confront and end a criminal occupation and apartheid by any means necessary, including armed struggle.

For Palestinians, history is, indeed, a guidepost of what is yet to come. For Palestinians, history is an unbroken saga, handed down from the elderly in refugee camps throughout the Middle East to their very young who find comfort in the cultural breath of dabke.

Mr Trump: Were you an informed observer of history, you would know well that this is not the first time the US has tried to designate a city as the capital of a state against the political and historical will of its people.

In Vietnam, such an attempt did not end well, as Saigon eventually gave way to the legitimate, national aspirations and rights of millions who refused to be held captive by the imperial design of a foreign occupation force.

Yes, Mr President, history does, and will indeed, repeat itself.

Capitals are much more than cold, sculpted monuments to those that have come before, or warehouses of political ideals and rights beyond the reach of all but the chosen few. Nor can they inspire from behind barricaded buildings in which petty despots dole out rights and benefits based upon one’s mere name or faith.

Capitals are homes to collective freedom and will, with open doors that know no artificial boundaries or lawful segregation. To be honest, to empower, they must represent the collective will and aspirations of all those who look to them for justice and opportunity.

For millions of Palestinians, that capital is Jerusalem. It weaves with the rock of the ages and hums to the tune of history. To walk down the ancient pathways of the Old City, to hear the call to prayer, to look out in all directions fromAl-Aqsaplaza across the open and free expanse beyond its age-old walls is a journey that is Jerusalem.

Nothing that you, Donald Trump, can say or do will undo the magic and majesty that is Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Palestine.

Donald Trump,‘Colonial erasure’: Iran slams Trump plan to ‘clean out’ Gaza,"Iran has condemned US President Donald Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, joining other countries in the region in rejecting the plan.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday that the international community should help Palestinians “secure their right to self-determination … rather than pushing for other ideas that would be tantamount to ethnic cleansing”.

The remarks from Baghaei come after Trump repeatedly floated an ideato “clean out” the Gaza Stripand move its entire population to Egypt and Jordan.

Trump called Gaza a “demolition site” following 15 months of Israeli bombardment that rendered most of the territory’s 2.3 million people homeless.

“‘Cleaning out’ Gaza … is part of colonial erasure of [the] Gaza Strip and the whole Palestine,” Baghaei said, adding that “no third party” can decide on the future of the Palestinian territory.

Iran and Israel, enemies for years, saw their first direct exchange of fire during the war in Gaza.

Regional rejection of the US plan comes as Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuvisits Washington, DC, where he is set to become the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his return to the presidency.

Before boarding his flight in Tel Aviv on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister said he would discuss “victory over Hamas”, countering Iran and freeing all the captives held by Hamas when he meets Trump on Tuesday.

Egypt and Jordan – key US allies in the region – have sternly rejected Trump’s proposal for mass displacement in Gaza.









On Saturday, the foreign ministers of five Arab countries issued ajoint statementpresenting a unified stance against Trump’s call for Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza.

Foreign ministers and officials from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League said Trump’s proposed move would threaten stability in the region, spread conflict and undermine prospects for peace.

“We affirm our rejection of [any attempts] to compromise Palestinians’ unalienable rights, whether through settlement activities, or evictions or annexation of land or through vacating the land from its owners … in any form or under any circumstances or justifications,” the statement read.

Last week, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi also said displacing Palestinians to Egypt would mean “instability for Egyptian national security and Arab national security in our region”.

“I say clearly: the displacement of the Palestinian people from their land is an injustice that we will not participate in,” el-Sisi said.

Despitethe backlash, Trump has insisted that Egypt and Jordan will eventually agree to his demands of displacing Gaza’s population.

“They will do it, OK?” he told reporters last week. “We do a lot for them, and they’re going to do it.”

Rights groups warn that forced displacement may constitute a crime against humanity under international law.

In 1994, United Nations experts defined ethnic cleansing as “a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/3/colonial-erasure-iran-slams-trump-plan-to-clean-out-gaza
Donald Trump,Why are the Central Park Five suing Donald Trump?,"In 1990, five Black and Latino teenagers — Kevin Richardson (14), Raymond Santana (14), Antron McCray (15), Yusef Salaam (15) and Korey Wise (16) — who became known as the Central Park Five, were wrongly convicted for attacking and raping a jogger, Trisha Meili, a 28-year-old white woman was in a coma for 12 days following the incident in April 1989.

Subsequently exonerated, the five — all of them now in their 50s — now find themselves in the middle of another legal battle: On Monday, the five men filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania suing former President Donald Trump, accusing him of “false and defamatory” statements he made during the presidential debate in September with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump is the Republican candidate for the November election, while Harris is the Democratic Party’s nominee.









It’s the latest chapter in a long-running saga involving the Central Park Five (now sometimes known as the “Exonerated Five”) and Trump — who once called for their execution in an infamous series of advertisements.

So what’s the latest lawsuit about, how has the Trump campaign responded and what’s Trump’s history with the Central Park Five?

At the September debate, Trump said that at the time of the interrogation process in 1989 the teenagers “admitted – they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately.”

However, no one was killed in the 1989 attack. Meili was severely battered, left in a coma,and is still dealing with long-term effects from the attack, but she survived.

Trump was also wrong in his claim that the Central Park Five pled guilty: Throughout the trial, they all insisted that they were innocent, as their lawyers pointed out in their lawsuit.

The lawsuit says Trump’s debate comments were given “negligently” and “with reckless disregard for their falsity”.

Four of the Central Park Five did say, in statements to the police during questioning, that they were involved in the assault. But many legal experts have accused the interrogators at the time of putting the five young men under duress and in effect, coercing four of them into falsely confessing to attacking and raping Meili.

Their sentences ranged from six to thirteen years.

In 2002, the Central Park Five were exonerated after Matias Reyes, a convicted serial rapist already serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes, confessed to Meili’s assault.

Reyes’s DNA matched the evidence collected at the crime scene which led Justice Charles J Tejada of the Supreme Court of the State of New York to grant a motion to vacate the convictions of the Central Park Five. In 2014, the five men sued the city of New York in a civil suit. The city agreed to a settlement worth $41m.

In 2016, the men were awarded a further $3.9m in a settlement from the New York State Court of Claims.

The attack on Meili sparked widespread outrage and anger: She was found naked and gagged, her skull fractured so badly that her left eye was dislodged from its socket.

Amid the media’s frenetic focus on the case, Trump took out full-page 600-word advertisements with his signature in The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and New York Newsday, advocating for the reinstatement of the death penalty.

The ads were titled: “Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!”

The advertisements stated: “I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.”

Despite the subsequent vacation of their convictions, Trump has never apologised for those advertisements.

Shanin Specter, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that Trump’s remarks “cast them in a harmful false light and intentionally inflicted emotional distress on them”.

But in a statement, Trump’s campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the lawsuit “just another frivolous, election Interference lawsuit”. He claimed the lawsuit was aimed at distracting “the American people from Kamala Harris’s dangerously liberal agenda and failing campaign.”

“The frantic lawfare efforts by Lyin’ Kamala’s allies to interfere in the election are going nowhere and President Trump is dominating as he marches to a historic win for the American people on November 5th,” Cheung stated, referring to the election date.

In the recent September presidential debate and at the Democratic National Convention in August, Harris and her supporters have continued to target Trump over his positions regarding the Central Park Five.

At the DNC, civil rights activist Al Sharpton brought out the Central Park Five on stage to speak out against Trump.

“He spent a small fortune on full-page ads calling for the execution of five innocent young teenagers,” Sharpton stated, referring to the Central Park Five.

“Forty-Five wanted us unalive,” Yusef Salaam said at the DNC, referring to Trump, the nation’s 45th president. “Today, we are exonerated because the actual perpetrator confessed and DNA proved it. [Trump] still says he still stands by the original guilty verdict. He dismisses scientific evidence rather than admit he was wrong.”

In the September debate, Harris criticised Trump for the full-page ad he did in 1989

“Let’s remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution.” Harris stated

“I think the American people want better than that, want better than this,” Harris added.

Yet, Trump has for months polled atrecord levels among Black voters— support that appears to have been undented by criticism from Harris and her campaign. Harris is also polling lower than previous Democratic Party candidates among Latinos.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/22/why-are-the-central-park-five-suing-donald-trump
Donald Trump,Donald Trump signs executive order to ‘eliminate’ Department of Education,"United States President Donald Trump has made good on a campaign promise to begin shuttering the Department of Education, though his efforts are likely to face court challenges and constitutional barriers.

On Thursday, the Republican leader held an elaborate ceremony to sign an executive order that would set in motion the department’s demise.

A semi-circle of children were arranged in desks around the president, each with their own version of the executive order to sign. When Trump uncapped his marker to sign the order, the children followed suit. When he lifted up the completed order for the cameras, so too did the kids.

“I will sign an executive order to begin eliminating the Federal Department of Education once and for all,” Trump said in remarks before the signing ceremony.

“And it sounds strange, doesn’t it? Department of Education, we’re going to eliminate it, and everybody knows it’s right, and the Democrats know it’s right.”

But Democrats and education advocates quickly denounced the action as not only another example of presidential overreach but as an effort that would harm students across the country.

“Attempting to dismantle the Department of Education is one of the most destructive and devastating steps Donald Trump has ever taken. This. Will. Hurt. Kids,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerwroteon social media within minutes of the ceremony.

The order called for Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, a longtime Trump ally, to “take all necessary steps” to facilitate the department’s closure, which must be approved by Congress.

The Department of Education was founded in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter, as part of an effort to consolidate various education initiatives within the federal government. In doing so, he created a new cabinet-level position, something Republicans even then argued would leach power away from states and local school boards.

The department, however, has a limited mandate. It does not set curriculums or school programming but rather focuses on collecting data on education, disseminating research, distributing federal aid and enforcing anti-discrimination measures.

Still, Trump has repeatedly held the department responsible for low educational achievement in US schools, an assertion experts say is misleading.

“ We’re not doing well with the world of education in this country. And we haven’t for a long time,” Trump said at Thursday’s ceremony.

The US does indeed trail other countries in global standardised test scores – but it is by no means last, as Trump has sometimes asserted.

The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), an international metric for education standards, has found that American students rank as average in their test scores: above countries like Mexico and Brazil but below places like Singapore, Japan and Canada.

Test scores had declined in mathematics from 2018 to 2022, something PISA attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. But achievements in reading and science remained stable.

Trump, meanwhile, also tied the Department of Education to his broader campaign to cut alleged waste and fraud in the federal government, including through widespread layoffs.

He explained from the podium on Thursday that he had offered buyout offers to Education Department employees.

“ We’ve cut the number of bureaucrats in half. Fifty percent have taken offers,” Trump said to applause.

He added that the employees consisted of “ a small handful of Democrats and others that we have employed for a long time – and there are some Republicans, but not too many, I have to be honest with you.”

Trump has previously pledged to expel all “Biden bureaucrats” and install loyalists instead.

Critics, however, say he has targeted nonpartisan civil service members with his layoffs, many of whom help maintain government stability from administration to administration.

One Trump ally who risks losing their position under the department shake-up is McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment.

Trump, however, reassured her from the podium on Thursday that she would remain in his government: “We’re going to find something else for you, Linda.”

Despite his executive order, Trump cannot single-handedly shutter the Department of Education.

Only Congress can formally shut down a cabinet-level department. But already, Republicans like Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana have stepped forward to begin legislative proceedings.

“I agree with President Trump that the Department of Education has failed its mission,” Cassidy said in anews release.

“Since the Department can only be shut down with congressional approval, I will support the President’s goals by submitting legislation to accomplish this as soon as possible.”

But if such legislation is introduced, it would likely not generate enough support to reach the threshold of 60 votes needed to overcome the filibuster in the 100-seat Senate.

“The Republicans don’t have that,” said Al Jazeera correspondent Shihab Rattansi, reporting from Washington, DC. The Republicans only have a 53-seat majority.

Still, Rattansi predicts the issue will likely end up before the Supreme Court, as education advocates prepare to mount legal challenges.

The Education Department, Rattansi explained, “is thought of as relatively low-hanging fruit” as the Trump administration tries to expand its executive reach.

“They have a very expansive view of executive power. They want to test that in court,” he said.

Part of the reason for its vulnerability is that the department is relatively young: It was founded within the last half-century.

But Rattansi warned that critical educational functions could be lost or suspended while legal challenges wind their way through the court system.

“What the Department of Education does is ensure equal access to education for minorities, for poor kids, for disabled children, and so on. So there’s that extra level of oversight that will now be – potentially, in the short term – removed as court cases are fought,” he said.

“In the long term, though, this is all about testing the limits of executive power for Donald Trump.”

Already, teachers’ unions like the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) are gearing up for a legal fight.

“As Republican governors at the White House celebrate the dismantling of a federal role in education, our members across the country are worried about the impact this will have on their students,” AFT President Randi Weingarten said in astatement. “This isn’t efficiency, it’s evisceration.”

Trump’s executive order does pledge to ensure “the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely”.

But critics fear programmes like the Pell Grant – which offers financial aid to low-income students – and services for students with disabilities could suffer as the department is taken apart. Trump tried to assuage those concerns on Thursday.

“They’re going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them,” he said.

He did, however, emphasise that individual states would be taking over the bulk of the department’s functions. His order specified no further federal funds would go to programmes related to “gender ideology” or diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), two frequent targets of his ire.

“ We’re gonna shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible,” Trump said of the Education Department.

“It’s doing us no good. We want to return our students to the states where just some of the governors here are so happy about this.”

In the audience was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a former rival of Trump’s in the 2024 presidential election, who likewise campaigned on dismantling the department.

Still, critics like Democratic lawmaker Rashida Tlaib of Michigan argued there was no other agency capable of enforcing national standards for equal education access.

“The Department’s federal funding ensures that all children, regardless of who they are or which zip code they are born in, can achieve a quality education. Without the Department of Education, many of our kids will be left behind, unable to receive the education they need and deserve,” shewrotein a statement.

“Without the Department of Education, no one will be left to ensure civil rights laws are enforced in our schools.”

She added that Thursday’s move was blatantly unconstitutional. “I look forward to it being challenged in court.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/21/donald-trump-signs-executive-order-to-eliminate-department-of-education
Donald Trump,Trump announces plan to launch task force against ‘anti-Christian bias’,"United States President Donald Trump has announced the creation of a task force aimed at eradicating what he called an “anti-Christian bias” within the federal government.

Trump made the announcement on Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC, an annual event that brings together religious groups with government leaders.

During his speech, Trump said that he would sign an executive order later in the day and appoint US Attorney GeneralPam Bondito lead the effort.

He also pointed to several government agencies that may be scrutinised under the effort, including the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

“The mission of this task force will be to immediately hold all forms of anti-Christian targeting and discrimination within the federal government, including at the DOJ, which was absolutely terrible, the IRS, the FBI and other agencies,” Trump said.

Bondi, he added, would also work to “fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide”.







While Trump did not give examples of what constitutes “anti-Christian bias”, the plannedexecutive actioncould pose constitutional questions about the separation of church and state.

Under the First Amendment of the US Constitution, the government protects freedom of religion.

Legal experts have often pointed to the “establishment clause” of that amendment — which says Congress “shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion” — as prohibiting the government from imposing or promoting religious beliefs.

But some evangelical advocates have argued that Christianity is a fundamental part of the US government system. Trump has courted that interest group throughout his campaigns for president.

On Thursday, Trump urged Americans to “bring God back” into their lives. In addition to the new task force, he also announced the establishment of a commission on religious liberty.

“If we don’t have religious liberty, then we don’t have a free country,” Trump said.

He also reflected on his relationship with religion after facing a pair of failedassassination attemptslast year, saying it “changed” him.

“I feel even stronger,” Trump, a nondenominational Christian, said. “I believed in God, but I feel, I feel much more strongly about it. Something happened.”

Speaking later at a second prayer breakfast sponsored by a private group, Trump remarked, “It was God that saved me.”

He also took aim at his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, accusing him of “persecution” for his administration’s prosecution of anti-abortion rights advocates accused of blockading reproductive healthcare clinics.







Trump’s new task force on “anti-Christian bias” has already drawn criticism.

“Rather than protecting religious beliefs, this task force will misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination, and the subversion of our civil rights laws,” Rachel Laser, the president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said.

Andrew Seidel, a lawyer at the Freedom From Religion Foundation, also questioned the motivation behind the new task force.

“This task force is not a response to Christian persecution; it’s an attempt to recover their declining Christian privilege and supremacy,” he wrote in a post on X.

“Christians are still the majority in this country. They are overrepresented in Congress and almost every other government body. But the demographics are shifting. Rapidly. And that’s precisely why we are seeing this rise of Christian Nationalism.”

President Trump and his administration have already clashed with certain religious leaders. The day after his secondinauguration, for instance, Trump attended a sermon delivered by Reverend Mariann Budde at the Washington National Cathedral, where she called for “mercy” for members of the LGBTQ+ community and undocumented immigrants.

Trump responded afterwards on his online platform Truth Social, calling Budde a “Radical Left hard line Trump hater”.

Vice PresidentJD Vance, who is Catholic, has also sparred with the top US leaders of his own church over immigration issues. Other clergy members across the country have voiced concerns about theremoval of churchesfrom a list of locations previously protected against immigration enforcement actions.

Thursday’s National Prayer Breakfast is a 70-year-old tradition in Washington, DC. Dwight D Eisenhower was the first president to attend the prayer breakfast, in 1953, and every president since has spoken at the gathering.

Donald Trump,What does Trump’s ethnic cleansing proposal mean for Gaza ceasefire deal?,"Washington, DC –Donald Trump has been claiming credit for the ceasefire deal that halted the war in Gaza, but the United States president’s proposal to forcibly displace the Palestinians in the territory risks torpedoing the agreement, experts say.

Trump repeatedly called this week for Gaza to be depopulated — a push that rights groups say would amount toethnic cleansing— and for the US to “take over” the Palestinian territory.

Leaders across the world have warned that uprooting Palestinians from Gaza would destabilise the entire Middle East. More immediately, Trump’s comments could derail the push towards an enduring end to the fighting in the territory.

“President Trump’s completely outrageous and outlandish calls for the ethnic cleansing of more than two million Palestinian people from Gaza severely undermines the chances for the continuation of the ceasefire,” said Josh Ruebner, a lecturer at Georgetown University’s Justice and Peace programme.

“Of course, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians was not in anyceasefire agreement, and by Trump putting that option on the table, he stands to wreck the very fragile process.”

The ceasefire came into effect on January 19, a day before Trump took office for a second term. But the US president has argued that his negotiating efforts, led by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, were instrumental to sealing the deal.

Trump invoked the ceasefire in hisinaugural addressas he pledged to leave a legacy as a “peacemaker and unifier”.







Days later, Trump suggested emptying Gaza of its inhabitants. Initially, it was easy to dismiss the comments as one of his off-the-cuff, hyperbolic pronouncements.

But then he repeated themagain and again. On Tuesday, he read prepared remarks that fleshed out his proposal while speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House.

“The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. We’ll own it,” Trump said.

Despite Trump’s comments, the ceasefire has continued to hold. The guns remain silent, and Hamas is set to release three more Israeli captives in the coming days in exchange for 183 Palestiniansheld by Israel.

However, the US president’s proposal raises questions about the later stages of the truce deal, which include discussions about the future of Gaza.

The first phase — which will see the release of 33 Israeli captives, a surge of humanitarian assistance to Gaza and partial Israeli withdrawal from the territory — is set to expire on March 1.

The second stage is supposed to see a complete pullout of Israeli forces from Gaza, a permanent ceasefire and the release of all remaining captives held by Hamas. And the third stage includes a five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza.

Trump’s push for the people of Gaza to leave the territory altogether appears to be in direct contradiction with the spirit of the agreement.

And there are signs that the US administration is no longer committed to all parts of the deal it has been bragging about brokering.

On Tuesday,Trump’s envoyWitkoff suggested that Washington will push to complete the first two stages to free all Israeli captives. But he seemed to renege on the third stage — rebuilding Gaza — saying that it “can’t go the way that agreement talks about, which is a five-year programme”.

Witkoff distanced the Trump team from the deal altogether, saying that it wasn’t “wonderful” from the start.

“We had nothing to do with it,” he said.







US officials have tried towalk back— or at least tone down — Trump’s comments, with White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt saying that people in Gaza would be “temporarily relocated”.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said that the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza would be in the “interim”, and residents would be able to “move back in” after reconstruction.

But the president has been reiterating almost daily this week that his plan is to permanently remove the Palestinians in Gaza and claim the territory for the US.

Khalil Jahshan, the executive director of the Arab Center Washington DC, said Trump’s proposal spells doom for the ceasefire.

“What we have heard from the White House this week, in my humble judgement, killed the ceasefire agreement totally. It’s gone,” Jahshan told Al Jazeera.

“It deprived the ceasefire agreement of its intended purpose: a solution for the day-after for Gaza and the people of Gaza. If the people of Gaza are going to be transferred ethnically to places from Indonesia to Albania to whatever, then what’s the purpose of proceeding?”

Trump himself has suggested that the war may restart soon.

“The strikes could start tomorrow,”Trump saidon Tuesday. “There’s not a lot left to strike.”

Since October 2023, Israel’s US-backed offensive in Gaza has killed nearly62,000 Palestinians, including thousands of missing people who are presumed dead.

But why did Trump emphatically claim credit for a ceasefire he did not intend on upholding?

“Donald Trump isn’t interested in the ceasefire for the wellbeing of Palestinians,” said Khaled Elgindy, a Middle East analyst.

“He’s interested in the headline of the ceasefire. He wants the credit. He wants to say, ‘I won. I’m the guy who did it.’ He doesn’t actually care if it’s implemented or if it falls apart or if it ends in ethnic cleansing.”

Elgindy said completing the second stage of the deal — a permanent ceasefire and Israeli troop withdrawal — will be vital for thwarting the ethnic cleansing plan.

“There’s no question that the ceasefire, on its face, is totally incompatible with a plan toethnically cleanseGaza,” Elgindy told Al Jazeera.

“This is why I think phase two is so critical. If we can get an agreement on phase two, and phase two is implemented, then I think the risk of actual ethnic cleansing is greatly diminished.”







Elgindy added that it doesn’t help the ceasefire that Trump “is talking crazy” about the future of Gaza, but seeing the deal through has its own dynamic — and the decision to do so lies with Netanyahu and the US president.

When asked about the ceasefire at the White House this week, Netanyahu pledged to continue to pursue three war goals: releasing the captives, destroying Hamas’s military and governing capabilities, and ensuring that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel.

Heavily armed Hamas fighters emerged across Gaza after more than 15 months of war after the ceasefire. And the group appears to still be overseeing the civilian administration of the territory.

Netanyahu could see his governing coalition collapse if Finance MinisterBezalel Smotrich, who favours resuming the war, withdraws from the government.

“At this point, Netanyahu already knows whether or not he wants a ceasefire — a phase two — and Donald Trump already knows whether he’s going to go along with Netanyahu’s decision,” Elgindy told Al Jazeera.

For Jahshan, Netanyahu made his plans known when he reiterated his intention to continue to pursue the war objectives.

“The statementsmade by Netanyahuin the presence of Trump, without Trump’s objection, is essentially a declaration of war — resuming the war soon. So to me, that’s probably the most likely scenario,” he told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/8/what-does-trumps-ethnic-cleansing-proposal-mean-for-ceasefire-deal
Donald Trump,How Donald Trump shook up US foreign policy,"President Donald Trump laid out his vision for an “America First” foreign policy during hisinaugural speechon the steps of the US Capitol on January 20, 2017.

“From this moment on, it’s going to beAmerica First,” he vowed.

“Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families,” he said.

“We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first,” he added.

Four years later, critics say Trump leaves a scattershot legacy that despite some breakthroughs, has left international organisations weakened and the US increasingly isolated from its closest allies as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on Wednesday.

“America first, but really America alone,” Joel Rubin, the deputy assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs under President Barack Obama and policy volunteer on the Biden campaign, told Al Jazeera.

Here are key points in Trump’s foreign policy.

On June 1, 2017, Trump announced the USwithdrawalfrom the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, a 196-country agreement signed in December 2015 that aimed to limit global average temperature rise to two degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial averages.

In Trump’s decision, the US became one of the largest major carbon emitters to eschew the agreement, which requires countries to set standards to reduce emissions and regularly report on their progress.







In his speech, Trump said the agreement disadvantages the United States to “the exclusive benefit of other countries” and leaves US workers and taxpayers “to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories and vastly diminished economic production”.

Due to the provisions of the agreement, the US withdrawal, which also reduced overall funding of the Green Climate fund, only went into effect on November 4, a day after the presidential election.

Biden has said he will rejoin the agreement on his first day in office.

As a candidate in 2016, Trump regularly targeted the 30-country North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an alliance created in the wake of World War II as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, and later Russian expansionism in Europe.

While Trump, after taking office, said he would honour the alliance, hereportedlyexplored withdrawing in 2018, prompting action from Congress.

Trump has maintained a contentious relationship with German leader Angela Merkel, long considered a key US ally, surprising her and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg by withdrawing and reshuffling US troops from Germany in June 2020. Critics say the move has left NATO weakened against Russia.







Trump’s abrupt November 2020 announcement of a troopdrawdownin Iraq and Afghanistan, where NATO service members train local forces, also unsettled countries in the alliance, who had not been consulted in the plan.

Trump maintained that the US was overpaying in its direct contributions to the military alliance, while European powers were “delinquent” in paying their fair share – a claim that has beendebunkedas a mischaracterisation.

Trump also took credit for a rise in defence spending from NATO members during his presidency, despite that increase being pledged in 2014.

Biden has vowed torestore and expandNATO.

Trump campaigned on promises to revive the nation’s manufacturing sector by punishing trade practices he described as “unfair”.

Starting in 2018, his administration unleashed three separate rounds of tariff actions. The first two targeted all major US trading partners by slapping tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines, then steel and aluminium.

The third and largest round was aimed at the US’s largest competitor and the world’s second-largest economy: China.

The Trump administration has since slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions dollars worth of Chinese goods, blacklisted Chinese tech companies and tried to strong-arm allies into barring Chinese telecom giant Huawei from their 5G network buildouts.

The administration has even tried to ban the social media site TikTok in the US.









Beijing has responded by slapping punitive levies on US goods, with both economiesharmedin the process.

Meanwhile, the justification for Trump’s trade wars – reviving US manufacturing – has not materialised. What was a healthy manufacturing landscape during Trump’s first year in office started to turn sour in 2018, when factory output began to decline and employment in the sector stalled.

Unwinding Trump’s policies without being seen as going soft on China willarguablybe one of Biden’s toughest challenges. The president-elect has vowed to take a hard line with Beijing, but it is unclear if he will continue Trump’s tariff-heavy approach.

Biden has also slammed Trump’s unilateral strategy, saying he would seek to work with US allies and within multilateral institutions to increase pressure on Beijing.

Trump proved a willing partner to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, long considered the home of a future Palestinian state, in May of 2018, andrecognisingIsraeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights in March 2019.

The relationship also included the January 2020 release of Trump’s much-malignedMiddle East Plan, which recognised illegal settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank and granted Israel security control of the Jordan Valley and occupied West Bank.







The Trump administration did achieve diplomatic normalisation agreements signed betweenIsrael, Bahrain, and the UAE, and laterSudanandMoroccowhich were seen as part of a larger goal to grow a regional coalition against Iran.

The agreements had bipartisan support in the US, and Biden is expected to attempt to build on them.

In October 2017, Trump announced he would not certify Iran’s compliance in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a 2015agreementbetween Iran and the US, France, Germany, United Kingdom, China, Russia and the European Union that saw Tehran agree to curtail its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.

In May 2018, Trumpunilaterally withdrewfrom the deal, which he has said is too lenient. Despite efforts by European parties to salvage the agreement, the US has imposed a campaign of maximum pressure sanctions against Tehran.







In response, Tehran has increasingly shrugged off provisions outlined in the deal, including enriching and stockpiling uranium beyond set limits, arguing the US’s non-compliance means it is not technically in breach.

The tensions between the US and Iran have at several times threatened to escalate into a military confrontation during Trump’s presidency, particularly following the January 2020 US assassination of Iranian GeneralQassem Soleimanishortly after he arrived in Baghdad, Iraq.

Biden has made bringing Iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal a priority, notablyappointinga national security adviser and deputy secretary of state who were instrumental in negotiating the original deal.

In August 2017, North Korea threatened to launch ballistic missiles near the US territory of Guam.

Trump threatened “fire and fury” if the threats continued, setting off a war of words between Trump and North Korean Kim Jong Un that often played out on social media.

The exchange resulted in three meetings between the two leaders, the first a June 2018 summit in Singapore, an abruptly ended second summit in Hanoi, Vietnam in February 2019, and the third in North Korea, with Trump becoming the first sitting US president to set foot in North Korea after crossing the Demilitarized Zone for the meeting.

Despite early, largely unenforceable, vows to achieve “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula, a more concrete dealnever materialisedand North Korea resumed missile testing. Pyongyang unveiled a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile in early January 2021.

Trump’s approach has split observers, with some saying the president bolstered Kim’s strength domestically. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has urged the Biden administration to build on Trump’s achievements with Kim and learn from his failures.

In his final months in office, Trump has overseen continued withdrawal of US troops from foreign countries, most recentlywithdrawingan estimated 700 US troops – the entire force in Somalia – by a January 15 deadline.

As of that date, the number of US troops in Afghanistan had been further reduced to 2,500, down from about 13,000 when the US in February 2020 inked adealwith the Afghan Taliban that sought to end US involvement in the South Asian nation while encouraging the armed group to begin peace talks with the Afghan government.







Intra-Afghan negotiations remain underway in Doha, Qatar, but there have beenno significant breakthroughs. Critics have said the deal favours the Taliban without adequately defining their commitments.

Trump also drew down US troops by about 500 to 2,500 in Iraq by January 15.

Trump had previously, and abruptly, withdrawn several hundred US troops fromnorthern Syriain October 2019, earning a rebuke from within his party for leaving Kurdish allies vulnerable to an advancement by the Turkish military.

Cracking down on undocumented immigration has been central to Trump’s campaign in his presidency, defined by expanding a costly wall along the southern border with Mexico.

The Trump administration issued the so-called “Remain in Mexico”policy in January 2019, which requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico – often in makeshift migrant camps – for their hearings after an initial screening at the US border.

The policy followed a short-lived “zero tolerance” policy that began in May 2018 and saw immigration officials separate about 2,600 children from their parents upon crossing the border.

The Trump administration alsosignedcontroversial “safe third party” agreements with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, which went into effect in 2019. The rule requires asylum seekers on their way to the US to apply for asylum in those countries if they pass through them first.

If they do not and arrive in the US, officials will send them back to those Central American countries, despite high rates of crime and a lack of economic opportunities.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/20/key-moments-in-trumps-foreign-policy
Donald Trump,‘Closest target’: Why is Donald Trump so focused on Canada?,"Montreal, Canada –In his first speech as Canada’s prime minister-designate,Mark Carneydelivered what observers have described as a stunning statement.

“I know that these are dark days,” Carney told a room full of supporters on Sunday after he won the race to lead the governing Liberal Party. “Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust.”

The country in question? An ally with which Canada shares the world’s longest undefended land border and, until recently, seemingly unshakeable ties: the United States.

“That is jaw-dropping in the broader context,” Jon Parmenter, a history professor at Cornell University in New York state, said of Carney’s remark.

Experts say the idea that the US can no longer be trusted reflects a sentiment that has beenspreading rapidly across Canadain recent months, however.

In that time, Canadians have watched with a mixture of shock, confusion and anger as US President Donald Trump repeatedly took aim at their country — both as part of his global trade policies and his expansionist ambitions.

Trump has imposed steep tariffs on Canadian goods and threatened more. He regularly calls for the annexation of Canada, and he has madeunfounded and disparaging claimsabout outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Canadian electoral system.

“The damage to the relationship is substantial,” Parmenter told Al Jazeera. “It’s going to be long-lasting.”

Yet, as Trump’s attacks against his country’s northern neighbour continue unabated, many observers are now asking: Why?

Why is the president targeting a country that had widely been viewed as one of the US’s most reliable partners? Why does Trump seem so fixated on Canada?







While the current US-Canada trade war is “unprecedented” in modern history, it is unsurprising in the context of Trump, according to Aaron Ettinger, a political science professor at Carleton University in Ottawa.

The US president pursued similar “America First” economic policies during his first term, Ettinger noted, includingimposing tariffson Canadian steel and aluminium imports in 2018.

“None of this is new. We know this is coming. He’s telegraphed everything. But now he’s talking about50-percent ratesof tariffs. The aggressiveness is jacked up more than it was seven or eight years ago,” Ettinger told Al Jazeera.

Within the scope of the Trump administration’s adversarial approach to foreign policy, Ettinger said he doesn’t believe Canada is particularly special. Instead, it “just happens to be the closest target, along with Mexico”.

“Trump treats all countries as if they are subordinates to his wishes. He loves their leaders when the leaders play along, and he doesn’t when they don’t,” Ettinger said.

“So Canada is going to get hit with tariffs, just like European Union countries and Mexico. Canada just happens to be close by. Canada also happens to be playing against type and fighting back pretty hard right now.”

The Canadian government hasimposed retaliatory tariffson billions of dollars worth of American goods, further stoking Trump’s ire. It has said the measures will remain in place until the US president rescinds and removes the threat of levies.







Yet, Trump’sfocus on Canadagoes beyond tariffs and economic policy alone.

Even before he re-entered the White House in January, the Republican leader began urging Canada to become the 51st US state. He has repeatedly referred to Trudeau as a “governor” instead of a prime minister.

Trump also has framed the plan to annex Canada as a boon for Canadians and a way to dodge US tariffs.

“The people would pay much less tax than they’re paying right now. They’d have perfect military protection,” Trump recently said.

While Trudeau and other Canadian leaders at first shrugged off the remarks as good-natured ribbing, they quickly began to take Trump’s repeated calls for annexation more seriously.

Last week, Trudeau told reporters that Trump wants “a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that’ll make it easier to annex us”. Theoutgoing prime ministersaid Canada will never become part of the US and called the administration’s tariffs a “very dumb” policy.

Trump and Trudeau never had a particularly warm relationship, and theypublicly clashedin 2018 over trade and tariffs as well.

That animosity could be playing a role in Trump’s recent rhetoric against Canada, said Geoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a centre-right think tank in Washington, DC.

“Trump is always looking for a way to exact revenge and retribution against people who have criticised him in the past, and certainly Trudeau would fall into that category,” he told Al Jazeera.

But Kabaservice said Trump’s “very 19th-century idea” of what it means to be a great power is at the heart of his annexation rhetoric.

“When Trump talks about wanting to ‘Make America Great Again’, one component of what he has in mind by greatness is a country that’s expansive, that reaches for and claims new territory, that enlarges itself,” he explained.

That said, when the US president says he wantsCanada to be the 51st state, he likely isn’t thinking about what that would mean in practice, including how absorbing a country of 40 million people would alter American politics, said Kabaservice.

“It’s sort of like just [a] boy’s fantasy: ‘Wouldn’t it be great if America could expand to take in all these other countries? Wouldn’t it be great if America was like Britain back in its imperial days, when the world map was covered in red?’

“I think that’s the level on which he thinks of these things.”

And while Trump’s base may not have annexing Canada on its list of priorities, Kabaservice said, the US president’s supporters enjoy when he proposes things “that make his enemies and even many of his allies unhappy”.

“They applaud what they see as his audacity, his willingness to envision a new world, and his ability to ‘own the libs’ and make them cry.”

According to Amy Koch, a Republican political strategist, Trump’s policies vis-a-vis Canada should also be seen as part of a wider push for dominance in the Western hemisphere.

Tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, calls to retake control of the Panama Canal andacquire Greenland, and an executive orderrenaming the Gulf of Mexicothe “Gulf of America” are all elements of that effort.

“It is [about] fully establishing dominance in the Western Hemisphere, and I think Canada is a part of that,” Koch told Al Jazeera.







Wherever Trump’s real motivation lies, observers agree that his stance towards Canada could have a lasting effect.

“The whole point about Donald Trump is that he is a bully, and bullies bully people who are susceptible to their strengths. And that’s what he’s doing,” said Kabaservice.

“Trump can do things like levy tariffs because he has the leverage over Canada and he has the latitude in terms of the responsibility of the chief executive … But we’re also in the process of destroying trust with our allies and that will be immensely difficult to rebuild.”

Ettinger added that, while people in the US and Canada keep trying to find the rationale behind Trump’s actions, the president may ultimately be “employing tactics without strategy”.

For example, US stock marketsplunged this weekamid the uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs push, raising fears that the country could slip into a recession.

“He knows that he wants to hit hard, or he wants to put tariffs, or he wants to escalate. But there’s no strategic means-to-ends calculation going on here,” Ettinger said. “And that makes the guy fundamentally irrational.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/12/closest-target-why-is-donald-trump-so-focused-on-canada
Donald Trump,I believe Donald Trump,"Twelve days into 2025 and I have already broken what amounted to my one and only New Year’s resolution.

I made a vow not to succumb to the easy temptation to write about the madness every time Donald Trump pens an insult-laced tweet or bombastic statement – without, of course, using spell check.









My calculation was that there would be ample opportunity after the US president-elect takes the oath of office later this month to devote time and space to his manic meanderings.

Part of the selfish reason why I promised myself that I would try to avoid, if possible, having to examine the meaning and implications of Trump’s signature spasms of absurdity was to shield myself – briefly, at least – from the undeniable psychological harm he has wrought on the world’s wounded psyche.

From the moment he announced his candidacy for the presidency in 2016, Trump has dominated our gaze and attention. Every depressing day since has been a cacophony of lunacy that has taken a stiff toll on the mind, spirit, and soul.

But escaping Trump has become impossible. Cloaked in enormous power, he continues – uninhibited by truth or decency – to burnish his insatiable narcissism and ego, offering us a bitter taste of the carnival of chaos looming on the not-to-distant horizon.

On Tuesday, Trump held a rambling news conference at his gilded ode to himself in Florida – Mar-a-Lago.

Among the countless examples of Trump’s stream-of-consciousness inanity were his musings about the “drip, drip, drip” of faucets and gas heaters.

“[A] gas heater is much less expensive,” Trump said. “It’s a much better heat and, as the expression goes, you don’t itch. Does anybody have a heater where you go and you’re scratching and – that’s what they want you to have.”

Ladies and gentlemen, the garbled synapses of the future president of the United States at work.

Ridicule aside, it would be a grave mistake to confuse Trump’s stumbling incoherence with a lack of iron-clad conviction.

As I have writtenearlierandoften, Trump is, in my view, a bona fide fascist. Fascists don’t bluster. Fascists don’t joke. Fascists don’t josh around.

Trump has a plan – saturated in authoritarian means and rhetoric – to realise what he described as a “golden age” where years of “weakness” will be replaced by a return to America’s rightful greatness, the jarring sequel.

Trump has assembled an obedient administration to fulfil his grand ambitions for America – with little, if any, resistance from a Republican-controlled Congress, the Supreme Court, or the prostrate billionaire owners of large swaths of corporate media seeking his good graces.

So, when Trump insists, again and again, that he will use military force, if necessary, to impose America’s hegemony over Greenland and the Panama Canal, for “vital” national security reasons, I believe him.

Trump was asked if he could “assure the world” that he would not, as president, use “economic or military coercion” to achieve his territorial aims. His quick reply was: “No.”

I believe him because, as history has confirmed, that is precisely what fascists are inclined to do.

As a Canadian, I also believe Trump when he warned that he would use America’s singular economic might, in effect, to compel Canada to become the 51st state.

I did not laugh. Instead, I shuddered when Trump was asked whether he was “considering using military force to annex and acquire Canada”.

The question was as remarkable as Trump’s response. “No, economic force,” he said, “because Canada and the United States, that would really be something.”

Fascists don’t “float ideas” involving seizing land, canals, or annexing sovereign nations. Once born, these “ideas” take tangible shape and form and, inevitably, blueprints are drawn up to turn them into reality.

As a result, I do not consider Trump’s promised aggression even against NATO allies as a “negotiating ploy” or a familiar tool to “distract” – as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recentlysuggested– from the onerous costs of the incoming president’s proposed across-the-board tariffs on Canadian goods imported into the US.

I am convinced that an emboldened Trump means to make America’s “golden age” come true – damn international law, damn territorial integrity, and damn Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty that states that an armed attack on one NATO member is an attack on all members.

It is time to dispense finally with the jejune reasoning that Trump is “kidding” when he makes “outlandish” comments such as possibly declaring war – economic or otherwise – on Greenland, Panama, or Canada.

Look, Trump believes every fantastical word he utters. Canadians, among others, have to admit it and confront a fascist bully – bluntly, plainly, and loudly.

A host of federal politicians rushing to social media to post missives scoffing at Trump’s “hysterical” schemes will not suffice.

The premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Andrew Furey, understood what needed to be said and how to say it.

“[Trump’s] history has been to create chaos in an attempt, in a confusion with humour. But then often those become policy statements and reality. So, to dismiss it as a joke is, in my opinion, not the right thing to do,” Furey said.

Canada, he added, is a “strong and sovereign country and it will always be a strong and sovereign country”.

Trump’s threats to Canada’s sovereignty were, the premier said, “completely unacceptable”.

Then, Furey, to his credit, issued a stark forewarning of his own directed at Trump.

“Sovereignty comes at an incredible price; a price paid by blood by Canadians, Newfoundlanders and Labradoreans, and to try to take that away is going to come at a significant cost.”

Donald Trump,Donald Trump’s statement in full after Joe Biden declared winner,"Democrat Joe Biden has been declared the winner of the United States presidential election by several major national media outlets, defeating incumbent Donald Trump.

Reacting to the projections on Saturday, Trump immediately accused Biden of “rushing to falsely pose as the winner”. The Republican has made repeated claims of electoral fraud without providing evidence, and his campaign has pledged to challenge the result in some battleground states.

Here is Trump’s statement in full:

“We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.

“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their access.

“So what is Biden hiding? I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/7/trump-biden-rushing-to-falsely-pose-as-the-winner
Donald Trump,Trump vs Zelenskyy: What’s behind escalating war of words?,"United States President Donald Trump has called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator” as the rift between them deepens over Ukraine peace negotiations.

Trump’s latest broadside against Zelenskyy came after the Ukrainian leader challenged his claims that Ukraine had started the war. Zelenskyy had also spoken against being left out of the Russia-US talks held in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Tuesday.









In an online post later on Wednesday, and during a speech in Miami on the same day, Trump deliveredscathing attacks against the Ukrainian leader, accusing him of taking US money and embroiling the country in an endless conflict.

Here’s the war of words between Trump and Zelenskyy and how it may affect the Ukraine peace initiatives:

In a Wednesday post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote that Zelenskyy, a “moderately successful comedian”, has “talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start”.

In terms of funding disbursed to Ukraine, he added: “The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe.”

Trump added that Zelenskyy “refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden ‘like a fiddle'”. He said Zelenskyy had done a “terrible job” as the leader of Ukraine, deeming him “A Dictator without Elections”.

“In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only ‘TRUMP,’ and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the ‘gravy train’ going.”

On Wednesday, onstage during the Saudi-backed Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute summit in Miami, Trump thanked Saudi Arabia for hosting talks about Ukraine which were attended by US and Russian officials.

On Tuesday, diplomats from Russia and the US held the first face-to-face talks since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine three years ago. After four hours of talks, the two sides agreed to form a team to work on ending the war – Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. They also agreed to revive diplomatic ties, which had descended to a historic low following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Trump’s comments came a day after Zelenskyy said that Trump was inhabiting a “Russian-made disinformation space” regarding the war in Ukraine.

“The reason that Donald Trump is doing this is that he is notoriously thin-skinned. And he is not happy about the comments that Volodymyr Zelenskyy made earlier,” said Al Jazeera’s White House correspondent, Kimberly Halkett.

On Tuesday, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war, saying: “Today I heard, ‘Oh, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years, you should have ended it… You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.”

He also asserted that Ukraine should conduct elections. He said, without evidence, that Zelenskyy had an approval rating of 4 percent.

The pushback from Zelenskyy, some analysts say, came after Trump repeated Russian talking points on the Ukraine war and excluded Kyiv from the Riyadh talks on Tuesday.

While the war of words between Trump and Zelenskyy has recently escalated against the backdrop of talks to end the Ukraine war, hostility has been brewing between the two for years.

During Trump’s first term in September 2019, he wanted Zelenskyy to work with US lawyer Rudy Giuliani in investigating political rival Democrat Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Trump alleged that Biden tried to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor in relation to his son. This was when it was alleged that Hunter accepted bribes from a Kyiv-based company, Burisma. Hunterpleaded guiltyin the tax evasion case butwas pardoned by Bidenmonths later in December 2024.

Despite criticising the Ukrainian leader on the campaign trail, Trump met Zelenskyy months before the elections at his New York base in Trump Tower to discuss how to end the war.

“We have evidence that these figures are being discussed between America and Russia. That is, President Trump … unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,” Zelenskyy told Ukrainian television on Tuesday in the context of Trump’s comments about his approval rating.

The war of words between the two leaders intensified after Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin last week and agreed to hold talks with Moscow without the involvement of Kyiv and Europe.

A miffed Zelenskyy asserted that Ukraine, with European nations, needed to be represented at Riyadh talks.

Trump’s overture to Putin has stunned European leaders who believe the Russian leader cannot be trusted. They fear a Ukraine deal without them would leave Europe vulnerable to Russian aggression.

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy accused the Trump administration of bringing Moscow out of isolation. He said Russia could not be trusted.

“This isn’t positive for Ukraine. What it does is that they’re bringing Putin out of isolation, and the Russians are happy because the discussion focuses on them.”

Zelenskyy’s five-year term was due to end in May 2024, but elections have been suspended after martial law was declared following Russia’s full-scale invasion of the East European nation.

The numbers cited by Trump in terms of aid to Ukraine contradicts data from the US government itself.

As of September 30, 2024, the US disbursed $183bn to aid Ukraine, according to Ukraine Oversight, a website created by the US government to record aid sent to Ukraine.

Independent research institutes also say the aid sent to Ukraine by the US was lower than $350bn. As of December 2024, European countries sent about $138bn to Ukraine, while the US sent about $120bn, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

In terms of Zelenskyy’s approval rating, at the end of 2024, 52 percent of Ukrainians said they trusted him, according to a survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS).

Trump’s claim that Ukraine started the war is also untrue. Russia sent troops inside Ukraine as part of what it called a “special military operation” and has since captured nearly 20 percent of Ukrainian territory.

Zelenskyy is due to meet Trump’s special envoy for the Ukraine-Russia war, Keith Kellogg, on Thursday in the capital, Kyiv.

Ukraine has sought security guarantees from its Western allies against Russian aggression in the event of a peace deal. Kellogg, who arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday, said: “We understand the need for security guarantees.”

How the public feud between Zelenskyy and Trump would affect the outcome of the talks is difficult to guess due to the US president’s unpredictable behaviour.

But US policy shift on Ukraine under Trump will impact the transatlantic ties, with European leaders scrambling for response.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the Spiegel newspaper: “It is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelenskyy democratic legitimacy.

“Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the elected head of state of Ukraine. The fact that proper elections cannot be held in the middle of a war is in line with the requirements of the Ukrainian constitution and electoral laws. No one should claim otherwise.”

United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Zelenskyy on Wednesday to reaffirm his support for the Ukrainian leader, a Downing Street spokesperson said, according to the BBC.

It was “perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the UK did during World War II”, the spokesperson added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/trump-vs-zelenskyy-whats-behind-escalating-war-of-words
Donald Trump,"Trump says Israel ‘losing PR war’ in Gaza, should finish war ‘fast’","Former United States President Donald Trump has warned that Israel is “losing the PR war” in Gaza because of the flood of distressing images coming out of the enclave.

Inan interviewwith conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday, Trump criticised Israel for releasing the “most heinous” and “most horrible” videos of buildings being destroyed in Israeli air strikes in Gaza.

“And people are imagining there’s a lot of people in those buildings … and they don’t like it, and I don’t know why they released, you know, wartime shots like that,” Trump said.

“I guess it makes them look tough. But to me, it doesn’t make them look tough. They’re losing the PR war. They’re losing it big. But they’ve got to finish what they started, and they’ve got to finish it fast, and we have to get on with life.”

Asked if he was still with Israel “100 percent”, Trump did not answer directly, but said Israel should get the war “over with fast” and  “get back to normalcy”.

“And I’m not sure that I’m loving the way they’re doing it, because you’ve got to have victory. You have to have a victory, and it’s taking a long time,” he said.

Trump has described himself as the most pro-Israel president in US history, pointing to his decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem.

But Trump has also harshly criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who provoked the Republican’s ire when he acknowledged US President Joe Biden was rightfully elected in 2020.

In an interview with Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom last month, Trump issued a similar warning about Israel losing international support as the conflict dragged on.

Trump has also criticised Biden’s policy on the Gaza war, even claiming that Jews who vote for Democrats “hate Israel”, although he has not outlined in concrete terms how he would approach the conflict differently.

On Thursday, the White House said Biden had warned Netanyahu in a phone call that continuing US support for the war would depend on “specific, concrete, and measurable steps” to protect civilians.

Biden’s warning, his strongest yet to the staunch US ally, came after the Israeli military killed seven aid workers employed by US-based charity World Central Kitchen, including a US-Canadian citizen.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/5/trump-says-israel-losing-pr-war-in-gaza-should-finish-war-fast

Donald Trump,Elon Musk reinstates Donald Trump’s Twitter account,"Elon Musk has reinstated Donald Trump’s account on Twitter, nearly two years after the former United States president wasbanned from the social media platformfor inciting violence.

Trump’s account reappeared on Twitter on Saturday after Musk, the platform’s new owner, ran a poll on the social media site that showed narrow support for allowing Trump to return.

More than 15 million people voted in the poll asking whether Trump’s account should be reinstated, with a slim majority of 51.8 percent voting in favour.

“The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated,” Musk tweeted.

But Trump said earlier on Saturday that he had no interest in returning to the platform.

“I don’t see any reason for it,” the former president said via video when asked whether he planned to return to Twitter by a panel at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership meeting.

The people have spoken.

Trump will be reinstated.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)November 20, 2022



Trump said he would stick with his new platform Truth Social, the app developed by his Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) start-up, which he said had better user engagement than Twitter and was doing “phenomenally well”.

Trump, who on Tuesdaylaunched a bid to regain the White House in 2024, also praised Musk and said he had always liked him.

But the former president also said Twitter suffered from bots, fake accounts and that the problems it faced were “incredible”.

Musk first said in May he planned to reverse the ban on Trump, and the timing of any return by the former president was closely watched — and feared — by many of Twitter’s advertisers.

Musk has since sought to reassure users and advertisers that such a decision would be made with consideration by a content moderation council composed of people with “widely diverse viewpoints”, and no account reinstatements would happen before the council convened.

He also said Twitter would not reinstate any banned users until there was a “clear process for doing so”.

This week, Musk reinstated comedian Kathy Griffin, who had been banned for changing her profile name to “Elon Musk”, which violated his new rule against impersonation without indicating it was a parody account.

There has been no new information about the process for reinstatement or the moderation council.

If Trump does not return to Twitter, it could reduce concerns among major advertisers, who are alreadyrattled by Musk’s drastic reshaping of the platform.

He has halved the workforce and severely cut the company’s trust and safety team, which is responsible for preventing the spread of misinformation and harmful content.

These actions and Musk’s tweeting have pushed big companies to halt advertising on the site as they monitor how the platform handles hate speech.

On Saturday, Bloomberg reported Twitter could fire more employees in its sales and partnership divisions, citing unnamed sources, just days after a mass resignation of engineers.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/20/elon-musk-reinstates-donald-trumps-twitter-account
Donald Trump,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.

Al Jazeera is an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government.
