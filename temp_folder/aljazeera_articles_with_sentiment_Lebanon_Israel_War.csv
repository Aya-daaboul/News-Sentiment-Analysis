Lebanon Israel War,Lebanon warns of ‘new war’ as death toll from Israel strikes rises,"The death toll from the series of Israeli strikes across Lebanon has risen to seven, the government said, as Prime Minister Nawaf Salam warned that his country was at risk of being drawn into a “new war”.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz ordered “a second wave of strikes against dozens of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon”, the defence ministry said on Saturday, in the largest escalation since a November 27 ceasefire.

The group Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the launch.

Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported two children were among the five people killed in an Israeli strike during the day on the southern town of Touline.

In the coastal city of Tyre in southern Lebanon, an Israeli air raid killed at least one person, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. Another Israeli attack in Qlaileh, southeast of Tyre, also wounded four people, according to the ministry.

The attacks on Saturday represent a major escalation by Israel. Tyre is one of the largest cities in southern Lebanon. Another strike was also reported in Zibqin, southeast of Tyre.

The Israeli military confirmed it was attacking what it said were Hezbollah targets in this second wave of strikes.

Earlier on Saturday, Lebanon’s Salam warned Israel’s “renewed military operations on the southern border” would bring “woes to Lebanon and the Lebanese people”.

The Lebanese group issued a statement denying any involvement in the series of rocket attacks on northern Israel from southern Lebanon.

In its statement, Hezbollah accused Israel of creating a pretext to renew its air attacks and reiterated its commitment to a ceasefire signed in November, which ended a year of war between the two sides.

After similar incidents in the past, Hezbollah would usually maintain silence and let the responsible party claim the attack. The official denial Saturday underscores the difficult situation the group is in amid internal and external pressures.

In Lebanon, Hezbollah is facing growing opposition from political foes, who have held it responsible for instigating the devastating Israeli offensive last year with its “support front” for Gaza.

Defence Minister Michel Menassa has said the Lebanese army has begun investigating the circumstances of the rocket fire. He also called on the states sponsoring the ceasefire to “deter the Israeli enemy from its continued violations and attacks under flimsy pretexts and false pretexts”.

Saturday’s reported exchange was the first since Israel on Tuesdayabandoned a separate ceasefirein the Gaza Strip with the Palestinian group Hamas.

Lebanon has blamed Israel for the protracted conflict afterfailing to withdrawfrom all Lebanese territory as stipulated in the ceasefire.

Under the deal, a January deadline was set for an Israeli withdrawal but Israel extended it to February 18. Since then, Israeli soldiers have remained in five locations inside Lebanon and its military has carried out dozens of deadly strikes against supposed Hezbollah targets, often striking civilians.

On Saturday, Salam declared that “all security and military measures must be taken to show that Lebanon decides on matters of war and peace”.

In a separate statement, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned “attempts” to destabilise his country and reignite violence as he called for action to prevent a further escalation of the conflict.







Israel said the attacks were “in response to the rocket fire at Israel”.

In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and Defence Minister Israel Katz instructed the Israeli military “to act forcefully against dozens of terror targets in Lebanon”.

Netanyahu said Israel was holding Lebanon’s government responsible for “everything taking place within its territory”.

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut, said there is “a lot of concern that the situation will spiral out of control”.

“What we understand is Lebanese officials are holding talks with the US-led committee monitoring the ceasefire to try to de-escalate tensions,” she said.

The conflict in Lebanon has been the deadliest spillover of the Gaza war, rumbling across the border for months before escalating into a blistering Israeli offensive that killed several of Hezbollah’s top leaders and commanders, destroyed much of its arsenal and killed thousands of civilians.

Andrea Tenenti, the spokesperson for the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Lebanon also known as UNIFIL, has told Al Jazeera the situation remains “very concerning”.

“We have been urging the parties to use maximum restraint,” Tenenti said, adding there have been intense negotiations involving several stakeholders “to prevent any escalation of the conflict and of the tension – something that no one wants to see after 16 months of conflict in this region”.

The UNIFIL spokesperson also stressed that the peacekeeping mission, which itself came under attack from Israeli forces during the recent war,  intends to maintain its presence in southern Lebanon.

In an interview with Al Jazeera, political analyst Sultan Barakat of Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Doha warned that “as long as the [Israeli] occupation continues, … the resistance will continue.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/22/lebanon-warns-of-new-war-as-israel-launches-fresh-deadly-strikes,NEGATIVE,0.9923575520515442
Lebanon Israel War,Here’s how Israel is repeatedly violating the Lebanon ceasefire,"Under the initial terms of the agreement that brought about a ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah in November, the former was to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon by January 26.

That date came and went, but Israel has refused to pull back its military, and the deadline has instead been pushed to February 18. Israel has also continued to sporadically bomb areas in Lebanon – to mass denunciations from the latter – claiming that it is targeting Hezbollah for violations of the ceasefire.

The Israeli presence in southern Lebanon means that thousands of people still cannot return to their homes in border villages, with Israeli troops shooting at people who get too close.

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah – a Shia group that is the strongest military force in Lebanon – began on October 8, as the Lebanese group launched strikes in solidarity with the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, which was coming under Israeli attack. Israelintensified its attacks on Lebanonin September and killedHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallahon September 27.

Israel has killed around 4,000 people across Lebanon since October 2023.

Why is Israel still occupying southern Lebanon? How is this a “ceasefire”? And what exactly is Israel’s end game?

Here’s all you need to know.

While Hezbollah has stopped its attacks, Israel has not.

Israel’s bombing is nowhere near the same intensity as it was before the ceasefire began on November 27, and nightly bombing of Beirut’s southern suburbs has stopped.

However, Israel is still carrying out attacks on occasion, some of which are north of the Litani River – which Hezbollah is required to move its forces north of, as per the ceasefire agreement.

The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a data collection group,has recorded 330 air strike and shelling incidentscarried out by Israel between November 27 and January 10, as well as 260 property destruction events.







Israel claims Hezbollah has also failed to meet the terms of the ceasefire.

Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz said Hezbollah has not withdrawn north of the Litani River, which lies in southern Lebanon.

“If this condition is not met, there will be no agreement and Israel will be forced to act on its own to ensure the safe return of residents of the north to their homes,” Katz said in January.

Hezbollah’s Secretary General Naim Qassem said in a speech in late January that Hezbollah had adhered to the ceasefire agreement but didn’t say specifically whether or not his group had completely withdrawn from the south.

ACLED has recorded one attack carried out by Hezbollah since the ceasefire began.

“Hezbollah has largely refrained from violence – there have been no direct attacks on Israeli soil since the ceasefire took effect, aside from a single attack on December 2 against the Israeli Rwayset Al Alam site in the occupied territories that we code as Syria,” ACLED’s Ameneh Mehvar told Al Jazeera.

Qassem said the group would remain patient despite the repeated attacks against it.

Lebanon has filed a complaint with the United Nations against Israel for its ceasefire violations.

France’s President Emmanuel Macron urged Israel to meet the first ceasefire deadline to withdraw its troops, to little effect. France and the United States were the agreement’s original brokers.

According to diplomatic sources, the US – a strong ally of Israel – gave assurances that the deal would be adhered to.

But there was no other recourse – and no suggested penalties – should the ceasefire be violated.

Israel has yet to be held accountable for repeated ceasefire violations or extending the ceasefire period until February 18.

It’s unclear.

Hezbollah’s Qassem said in a speech in January that his group’s patience might run out with Israel’s violations. But in a more recent speech, he seemed to lay the responsibility to oppose Israel on the Lebanese state.

“The Lebanese state is fully responsible for following up, pressuring and trying to prevent as much as it can, through sponsors and international pressure, this violation and this Israeli aggression,” Qassem said in a televised address last week.

The Lebanese army is supposed to move into southern Lebanon as part of the ceasefire agreement.

Any Hezbollah response will be limited by the weakened position it finds itself in. The fall of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria cut off Hezbollah’s land route to receive weapons from its primary backer, Iran.

Its military capabilities also took a heavy beating during the two-month escalation from September until November, during which Israel invaded Lebanon. And it has lost most of its upper military leadership.

For these reasons, Hezbollah appears reluctant to take any action that will give Israel a reason to intensify its attacks.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel bombs Lebanon for a seventh day as people forced to sleep on streets,"Israeli jets have continued attacking targets across Lebanon, including the capital, Beirut, for a seventh day, with Lebanese officials saying the nonstop bombardment had left up to a million people in the streets.

As fears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah grow, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Sunday the intense Israeli attacks had possibly caused the “worst displacement crisis” in the country’s history.

Earlier, the Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck Hezbollah targets, including rocket launchers and weapons storage facilities, and carried out dozens of air raids across Lebanon.

At least 11 people were killed in an air raid on a house in the town of Ain in the Bekaa Valley in the northeast, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency. Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Marjeyoun in southern Lebanon, said a civil defence centre was hit in a small town just outside the Tyre governorate, killing four people and injuring several others.

Overall, Lebanon’s Health Ministry says more than 1,000 Lebanese have been killed and 6,000 wounded in the past two weeks.

Also on Sunday, the Israeli military announced the killing of senior Hezbollah official Nabil Kaouk, a day after the groupconfirmedthe killing of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an attack on Friday on a densely populated civilian area of southern Beirut. Hezbollah also confirmed Kaouk’s killing on Sunday.

Mikati said the only option to end the conflict was a diplomatic solution. “There’s no choice for us but diplomacy.”







The killing of several top Hezbollah commanders in recent weeks has dealt a huge blow to the group engaged in cross-border fighting with Israel since last October. The Iran-backed group has set a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as a condition to stop the attacks it began in solidarity with Palestinians in the besieged and bombarded territory, where nearly a year of Israeli attacks has killed more than 41,500 people.

On Sunday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the killing of Revolutionary Guards Deputy Commander Abbas Nilforoushan alongside the Hezbollah chief “will not go unanswered.”

“This horrible crime of the aggressor Zionist regime will not go unanswered, and the diplomatic apparatus will also use all its political, diplomatic, legal and international capacities to pursue the criminals and their supporters,” he said, according to a foreign ministry statement.

The killing of Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for more than 30 years and built the Lebanese group into a powerful force, is one of the heaviest blows ever dealt by Israel to Hezbollah.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said Hezbollah is at a turning point “both at an organisational level and at the popular level”.

“There is no doubt thatHassan Nasrallahwas considered arguably the most powerful man in Lebanon even though he did not hold public office,” she said.

“Hezbollah needs to prove that its command and control structure is intact, that its leadership is still able to function.”

Israel has hinted at launching a ground incursion into Lebanon with army chief Herzi Halevi saying on Saturday that Israeli troops were prepared for what was to come and Lebanese residents were told to flee to safety.

Speaking for the first time since the assassination of Nasrallah, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there are now two war goals for northern Israel bordering Lebanon.

The first is to return evacuated Israelis back to those towns and settlements in the north. The second is to restore the balance of power on the northern border, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut reported.

“Israeli officials were saying all day on Saturday that they are determined to destroy Hezbollah and destroy all of its military capabilities. The Israeli army chief of staff, along with Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, have approved new plans for offensive strategies in the north,” Salhut said.

“This comes amid fears of a looming ground invasion into southern Lebanon – something that is causing a lot of fear on both sides of the border.”







Meanwhile, United States President Joe Biden said on Saturday that it was time for a ceasefire.

Asked by reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware if an Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon was inevitable, Biden responded: “It’s time for a ceasefire.”

Asked if the US would respond to missile attacks on its warships in the Red Sea, Biden said: “We’re responding.”

Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi said Biden’s statement raised several questions.

“When he says he’s for a ceasefire, does he mean a complete ceasefire? Does he accept what Hezbollah has long said – that if Israel stops the destruction of Gaza, then residents of northern Israel can return to their homes? Or is he accepting the argument from Israel that the only way to de-escalate is to escalate? Reportedly, there are proponents of that strategy in the administration,” Rattansi said.

“We have heard that the administration is against an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon but then consistently we have heard the administration say that it’s against actions that Israel subsequently does.”

On Friday, Yemen’s Houthi rebelsclaimed attackson the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv and Ashkelon, as well as three US Navy warships, with missiles and drones.

The Houthis have repeatedly fired at Israel and have carried out numerous attacks on Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait since November in what they describe as a campaign of solidarity with Palestinians under Israeli attack in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/29/israel-bombs-dozens-of-targets-in-lebanon-after-nasrallahs-assassination,NEGATIVE,0.994253933429718
Lebanon Israel War,The history of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel,"The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel – which have been exchanging fire across the border of Israel and Lebanon since the start of the war on Gaza last October – has descended into “war”, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr has reported from Beirut.

Hezbollahconfirmedthat its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, had been killed in anIsraeli air strikeon residential buildings in Beirut, which Israel claimed were above Hezbollah’s headquarters, on the night of Friday, September 27. Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and other Hezbollah commanders, were also killed in the massive air attack on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh on Friday, the Israeli military claimed.

On Saturday, Israel’s military said jet fighters had also attacked “dozens” of Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley and various areas of southern Lebanon and the attacks are continuing.

The conflict has escalated severely since September 17, when some 2,800 people in Lebanon were injured when their pager devices exploded. At least nine people were killed, among them three children.

Most of the people injured in that attack were members of Hezbollah, which blamed the attack on Israel.

Hezbollah has been trading attacks across the southern Lebanese border with Israel for nearly a year, since October 8 when it began its attacks to deter Israel from its war on Gaza, which has killed at least 41,500 people.

Israel has returned fire, escalating and slowing in turn against one of the region’s most experienced nongovernmental fighting groups, which is well-armed and battle-tested against it.

The conflict between the two is not new, rather it goes back nearly half a century.

Here’s a timeline:

Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982, ostensibly in response to attacks launched on it by the Palestine Liberation Organization from southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s civil war had been raging for seven years by then.

Hoping to install a friendly government in Lebanon, Israel occupied the south and went as far as West Beirut, where the PLO was based, which it put under siege.

After an agreement, the PLO left for Tunisia but Israel’s military stayed in Lebanon, supporting local proxies in the civil war and contributing to the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Right-wing Lebanese militia, in coordination with the Israeli army, killed between 2,000 and 3,500 Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians in two days.

Several Lebanese groups formed to repel the invasion, one was from the Shia Muslim community, traditionally a quiet demographic.

Hezbollah was the brainchild of Muslim leaders, reportedly supported by Iran, and given the mandate of repelling Israel.

Drawing support from disaffected youth and residents of the Bekaa Valley and Beirut’s southern suburbs – marginalised areas with significant Shia populations – Hezbollah quickly became a significant power in Lebanon.

Between 1982 and 1986, a number of attacks against foreign military presences were executed and claimed by various groups, but many were blamed on Hezbollah.

On October 23, 1983, the bombing of several barracks buildings in the capital, Beirut, killed more than 300 French and American peacekeepers.

The bombing was claimed by the Islamic Jihad group, believed by many to be a front for Hezbollah.

By 1985, Hezbollah’s fighting power grew to the point that it, along with allied groups, was able to force the Israeli army to withdraw to the Litani River in south Lebanon.

Israel declared what it called a “security zone” along swaths of the Lebanese-Israeli border.

Policing that security zone was the Christian-dominated South Lebanon Army (SLA), typicallyreportedas an Israeli proxy force, which continued to support the occupation of south Lebanon until Israel’s withdrawal in 2000.

In 1992, after Lebanon’s civil war (1975-1992) ended, Hezbollah entered parliamentary politics, winning eight seats in Lebanon’s 128-seat assembly.

Hezbollah’s seats have increased and the group and its allies now have 62 seats in parliament.

It also runs extensive social programmes in areas where its presence is strongest, increasing its influence.

In July 1993, Israel attacked Lebanon in what it called “Operation Accountability”, known as the Seven-Day War in Lebanon.

The assault came after Hezbollah responded to Israeli attacks on a refugee camp and village in Lebanon by attacking northern Israel, causing casualties.

The conflict killed 118 Lebanese civilians and wounded 500 more, and destroyed thousands of buildings.







Three years later, on April 11, 1996, Israel launched another 17-day offensive intended to force Hezbollah beyond the Litani River and out of striking range of Israeli targets.

What the Lebanese call the April Aggression was called “Operation Grapes of Wrath” by Israel, referencing the 1939 novel by US author John Steinbeck.

There were significant military and civilian casualties on both sides and Lebanon’s infrastructure was badly damaged.

On April 18, Israel shelled a United Nations compound near the village of Qana in occupied southern Lebanon – some 800 displaced civilians were sheltering there.

The attack killed 106 civilians, including at least 37 children, and injured about 116.

Four Fijian soldiers, assigned to the UN interim peacekeeping force, were also seriously injured.

In a 2006 operation into Israeli territory, Hezbollah killed three Israeli soldiers, Wassim Nazal, Eyal Benin and Shani Turgeman, and captured two, Ehud “Udi” Goldwasser and Eldad Regev.

Hezbollah demanded the release of Lebanese prisoners in exchange for the Israeli soldiers. In the end, the bodies of both Goldwasser and Regev were returned two years later in exchange for five Lebanese prisoners.

Later the same month, the July War broke out, lasting 34 days.

Approximately 1,200 Lebanese people died and 4,400 were wounded, mostly civilians. Israel, meanwhile, reported 158 deaths, most of them soldiers.

In 2009, while maintaining its opposition to Israel and its continued support for Iran, Hezbollah updated its manifesto, committing to its integration into a democratic form of government that represented national unity rather than sectarian interests. This was its second declaration, after 1985’s Open Letter which had directly opposite domestic goals.

The 2009 manifesto doubled down on the idea of resistance against Israel while showing how entrenched Hezbollah was becoming in all layers of Lebanon.

Hezbollah entered Syria’s civil war in support of the Damascus regime from 2012, a move criticised by many of its former Arab supporters and also condemned by one of the group’s founders, senior cleric Subhi al-Tufayli.

However, their supporters claim this deployment played a role in preventing the encroachment of armed groups, particularly ISIL (ISIS), into Lebanon, as well as gaining Hezbollah extensive battlefield experience.

In October 2023, Hezbollah launched a rocket campaign on Israel in support of Gaza, which was being bombarded by Israel following a Hamas-led surprise attack on Israel that saw 1,139 people killed and some 250 taken captive. Israel returned fire.







In Lebanon, 97,000 people have been forced from their homes, with 566 people killed, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. At least 133 were civilians.

About 60,000 Israelis were evacuated from the border region of northern Israel. People on both sides have yet to return to their homes.

Israel has carried out strikes and assassinations in Lebanon and Syria, killing several senior Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

Hezbollah played a role in what was regarded as one of the most dangerous points of the conflict after Israel was blamed for striking Iran’s consular building in Damascus on April 1, 2024.

When Iran responded to Israel two weeks later, Hezbollah was prominent in its support of Tehran.

On July 28, 12 Syrian children and young adults were killed on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an incident that kicked off an escalation.

Israel and Hezbollah denied responsibility for the incident but Israel cited the tragedy as the cause for the assassination of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in southern Beirut a few days later.

Shukr’s killing, as well as that of Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, within days, has left the region on high alert.

Hezbollah launched arocket attack in late Augustas the first stage of its response to Shukr’s assassination.

On September 17, 2024,thousands of hand-held pagersbelonging to Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon exploded.

So far, at least 11 people, including three civilians, have been killed as a result of the attack and approximately 2,750 have been wounded.

Hezbollah has confirmed it holds Israel responsible and has promised retaliation.

Lebanon Israel War,Beyond Hezbollah: The history of tensions between Lebanon and Israel,"Beirut, Lebanon –The Lebanese armed groupHezbollahand Israel’s military have exchanged artillery fire and other attacks across their shared border over the last week, escalating fears that aregional warcould erupt.

The violence comes amid the ongoingbombardmentandblockadeof the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory at the heart of the Israeli-Hamas conflict.

Israeldeclared waron Hamas on October 8, one day after the Palestinian group launched asurprise attackfrom Gaza that killed an estimated 1,400 Israelis. In the wake of Israel’s aerial bombing of Gaza, Palestinian deaths have soared tonearly 2,800.

The violence has spurred the Iran-backed Hezbollah to say it would stand “in solidarity” with the Palestinian people. Its subsequentattacks— and Israel’sretaliation— have reawakened memories of aconflictbetween the two forces that has been relatively dormant since 2006.

As tensions threaten to reignite, here’s what you need to know about the history of the Lebanese-Israeli conflict.

Pre-1948:Before the establishment of the state of Israel, Lebanon debated what kind of relationship it would have with the Zionists in Palestine, according to Makram Rabah, a history lecturer with the American University of Beirut.

Lebanongained independence from France in 1943. Certain nationalists in the newly formed republic believed in an alliance of minorities that would see a Christian-Lebanese nation align with the Zionists.

But Lebanon’s founding fathers — primarily Riad al-Solh and Bechara el-Khoury — felt they could not have a relationship with Israel and maintain good relations with neighbouring Arab states, according to Rabah.

1948:The state of Israeldeclared independenceon May 14. The next day, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon declared war on Israel. Lebanon had the smallest army of the Arab nations.

The Israeli forces repelled the Arab fighters and temporarily occupied part of south Lebanon. An armistice was signed on March 23, 1949, and Israeli troops withdrew to the internationally recognised border.

1965:The emergence ofFatah, a Palestinian nationalist group, as a powerful force in the region coincided with renewed border skirmishes.

“The Lebanese-Israeli border was quiet until around 1965 when the Fatah movement started launching low-intensity attacks on Israeli positions,” Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut, told Al Jazeera.

The Lebanese army attempted to counter Fatah’s operations, but public opinion was split.

Many in the country’s Muslim community and in the secular or pan-Arabist left sympathised with the Palestinian cause. However, Lebanon’s nationalist right — predominantly made up of major Maronite parties, representing a largely Christian base — did not want to be implicated in a conflict they felt did not concern them.

1967:Tensions between Israel and surrounding Arab states escalated into theSix-Day Waron June 5.

Butwithin a week, “Arab militaries were soundly defeated by the Israelis,” Khashan said. As a result of Israel’s victory, Palestinians were expelled from Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in what became known as the “Naksa” orthe setback.

Lebanon’s military involvement in the Six-Day War was minimal, but the repercussions were significant. Thousands of Palestinian refugees fled to Lebanon, and violence was incited against Lebanon’s Jewish population, leading many to emigrate.

A year later, Yasser Arafat’s Fatah took control of thePalestinian Liberation Organisation(PLO), a broad coalition representing the Palestinian people.

“Palestinians now started to launch operations against Israel with the 14 groups under the umbrella of the PLO,” Khashan said.

1969:On November 2, delegations led by PLO leader Arafat and Lebanese army General Emile Bustani signed the Cairo Accord.

The agreement transferred control over 16 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon to the Palestinian Armed Struggle Command, an entity created by the PLO.

“The Cairo Accord gave the PLO official recognition to launch operations from Lebanon into occupied Palestine,” Rabah said.

1970:Palestinian fighters led a failed uprising in Jordan, resulting in their expulsion by King Hussein in September. The event would be called Black September.

In the aftermath, the PLO relocated its main headquarters from Jordan to the Lebanese capital Beirut and its military headquarters to south Lebanon.

1973:On the night of April 9 and continuing into the early hours of April 10, Israeli special forces took speedboats and landed on Lebanese beaches. They assassinated three PLO leaders. Part of Israel’s Operation Wrath of God, the raid became known in Arabic as the Verdun Massacre.

1978:Lebanon-based Palestinian fighters continued to conduct cross-border raids, and in March, Israel invaded Lebanon, advancing as far as the Litani River.

In response, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 425, which called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces. It also established the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which still operates to this day.

At the time, Israelis armed and financed the South Lebanese Army, composed of Lebanese Christians. Palestinian groups, meanwhile, were backed by Syria.

1979:A peace agreement between Egypt and Israel — stemming from the previous year’s Camp David Accords — shifts the balance of power in the Middle East.

“Arab states came to the conclusion that they couldn’t attack Israel without Egypt,” Khashan said.

1982:On June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon under the pretence of stopping PLO raids across its border. The Israeli forces, however, progressed as far north as the capital Beirut, laying siege to the largely pro-Palestinian West Beirut.

The invasion led to the eventual departure of the PLO from Lebanon under the supervision of a multinational peacekeeping force on September 1.

Israel’s invasion of Lebanon would also help spark the creation of Hezbollah, with the backing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. “Iran claimed responsibility for the Palestinian [cause] at a time when Arab countries had abandoned it,” Khashan said.

Meanwhile, on September 14, Lebanese Forces (LF) leader and President-elect Bashir Gemayel was assassinated by a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. Two days later, with cover from the Israeli military, fellow LF leader Elie Hobeika rallied right-wing Christian forces which killed hundreds, if not thousands, of Palestinians and Lebanese Shias.

This is now known as the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Although the full number of casualties remains uncertain, some estimates put the death toll between 2,000 to 3,500.

1985:Israel withdrew to the Litani River in south Lebanon and created what it called a security zone there. The Israeli occupation of the southern region continued until 2000.

1993:Israel launched what it called Operation Accountability in Lebanon after Hezbollah operations killed at least five Israeli soldiers. Also known as the Seven-Day War, the conflict resulted in thousands of buildings bombed, with 118 Lebanese civilians killed and 500 more wounded.

1996:Casualties on both sides of the Lebanon-Israel border gave rise to Operation Grapes of Wrath on April 11. Israel bombarded Lebanon with shells and air raids, resulting in the Qana Massacre of more than 100 Lebanese people, including at least 37 children.

2000:On May 24, Israel declared it would withdraw its forces to the Blue Line, its UN-designated border. The decision effectively ended the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon. The Lebanese people celebrate May 25 as a national holiday.

“There was a widespread opposition in Israel” to the occupation in Lebanon, Khashan explained.

However, as Israeli forces retreated, many members of the South Lebanese Army joined them in exiting Lebanon.

2006:In an operation into Israeli territory, Hezbollah killed three soldiers and captured two. Hezbollah demanded the release of Lebanese prisoners in exchange for the Israeli soldiers. But as Hezbollah sent rockets and Israel responded with airstrikes, the July War broke out and lasted 34 days.

Approximately 1,200 Lebanese people died and 4,400 were wounded, mostly civilians. Israel, meanwhile, reported 158 deaths, most of them soldiers.

“2006 wasn’t as much a war between Lebanon and Israel as much as it was between Hezbollah and the latter,” Rabah said.

2023:Until recently, the border had been relatively quiet. Occasional rockets or drones crossed from Lebanon into Israel without leading to serious escalation, while Israel violated Lebanese airspace more than 22,000 times from 2007 to 2022.

But that relative stability changed in the last week. As Israel and Hezbollah trade attacks, deaths have started to mount. Among the casualties are a Lebanese journalist for Reuters namedIssam Abdallah, an elderly Lebanese couple and one Israeli civilian.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/beyond-hezbollah-the-history-of-tensions-between-lebanon-and-israel,NEGATIVE,0.9897308349609375
Lebanon Israel War,Israel’s war on Lebanon triggers unprecedented displacement crisis,"Beirut, Lebanon –On Friday evening, a sudden explosion heavily damaged Dina’s* home in the Burj al-Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon’s capital Beirut. It was caused by the shock wave of an Israeli air attack, during which dozens of bombs were dropped at once on a nearby apartment complex in Dahiyeh, a southern suburb of the capital that is about two kilometres (1.2 miles) away from the refugee camp.

The huge attack killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah and an unknown number of civilians after it levelled several residential buildings, leaving thousands more destitute. The blasts shattered the glass of small shops and cars in the camp, blew doors off their hinges and devastated nearby buildings and homes, explained 35-year-old Dina.

The explosions triggered mayhem as thousands of people and vehicles in the camp rushed towards its narrow exits. Dina grabbed her 12-year-old brother and ran down the stairs from their home, where she saw their elderly mother lying on the ground covered in debris.

Initially fearing that their mother was dead, Dina’s brother broke down. However, it turned out she was still conscious.

“My mother was confused and delirious, but I helped her up and told her that we had to run. I knew more bombs were coming,” Dina told Al Jazeera from a cafe in Hamra, a bustling neighbourhood in central Beirut that has absorbed thousands of displaced people from across Lebanon.

Israel escalated its conflict with Hezbollah in the second half of September, devastating southern Lebanon and triggering mass displacement.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), one million people have been uprooted from their homes due to Israel’s attacks, 90 percent of them in the last week.

But Lebanon’s caretaker government – operating without a president and reeling froma severe economic crisis– has struggled to respond to people’s needs. Thousands are sleeping on the floors of classrooms after the governmentconverted more than 500 schools into displacement shelters.

Thousands of others are sleeping in mosques, under bridges and in the streets. But the crisis could get even worse now that Israel has begun a ground offensive.

“A ground invasion will compound the problem,” said Karim Emile Bitar, a professor of international relations at Saint Joseph University in Beirut. “We already have more than one million people who left their homes. That is around the same number we had in 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon and reached Beirut.”

Moments after Israel announced its ground offensive, it ordered civilians to evacuate 29 towns in south Lebanon.

Nora Serhan, who is originally from southern Lebanon, said that her uncle remains in one of the border villages. He refused to leave when Hezbollah and Israel began an initially low-scale conflict on October 8, 2023.

Hezbollah had begun firing projectiles at Israel with the stated aim of reducing pressure on its ally Hamas in Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 41,600 people and uprooted nearly the entire 2.3 million population.

The devastating war on Gaza followed a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, in which 1,139 people were killed and around 250 taken captive.

After Israel and Hezbollah began exchanging fire, Serhan’s uncle chose to stay put. She suspects that he did not want to abandon his house and surroundings, even though the conflict cut off his water and electricity. But since Israel announced its ground offensive, Serhan’s family lost contact with him.

“When [Israel escalated the war last week], I think that maybe it became safer for my uncle to stay in the village than to risk fleeing on the roads,” she told Al Jazeera.

Hundreds of thousands of people have abandoned their homes and villages to seek safety in Beirut, as well as in towns further north.

Abdel Latif Hamada, 57, fled his home in southern Lebanon last week after Israel began bombing the region. He said that a bomb killed one of his neighbours, while another was trapped inside his home after rubble and debris piled up outside the entrance.

Hamada risked his own life to clear the rubble and save his neighbour. He said that they were able to flee five minutes before Israel bombed their own homes.

“I didn’t rescue him. God rescued him,” said Hamada, a bald man with a nest of wrinkles around his eyes.







Despite fleeing just in time, Hamada wasn’t safe yet. He hitched an exhausting and terrifying 14-hour ride to Beirut – the journey typically takes four. Thousands of cars were squeezed together trying to reach safety, while roads were obstructed by rubble and stones that were blown off nearby homes and buildings.

“Israeli planes were all over the sky and we saw them drop bombs in front of us. I often had to get out of the vehicle to help clear the debris and stones obstructing our car,” Hamada told Al Jazeera.

As he took another drag from his cigarette, Hamada said that he wasn’t scared when Israel escalated its attacks. Over the course of his life, Israel has displaced him three times from his village, including duringits invasion of Lebanon in 1982and itsdevastating assault on the country in 2006.

In the latter war, an Israeli bomb fell on his home and killed his wife Khadeja.

“I’m not scared for my own life anymore. I’m just scared of what awaits the generation ahead of me,” Hamada said.

Civilians and analysts fear that the ongoing displacement crisis could end up being protracted – even permanent.

According to Michael Young, an expert on Lebanon with the Carnegie Middle East Centre, Israel’s objective over the last two weeks has been to create a major humanitarian crisis for the Lebanese state and particularly for Hezbollah, which represents many Shia Muslims in the country.

“What’s worrisome is what will Israel do when it does invade? Will they begin dynamiting homes as they did in Gaza? In other words, do they make the temporary humanitarian crisis a permanent one by ensuring that nobody can return [to their homes]?” Young asked.

“This is a big question mark,” he said. “Once the villages are emptied, what will the Israelis do to them?”

Hamada and Dina both vow to return to their homes again, when they can.

Dina said her father and sister have already gone back to Burj al-Barajneh – now a ghost town – due to the terrible conditions in the displacement shelters, where there are few basic provisions and no running water.

She added that there is a growing feeling among everyone in the country that Israel will turn large swathes of Lebanon into a disaster zone, just as they did in Gaza.

“They are going to do the same thing here that they did in Gaza,” Dina said.

“This is a war on civilians.”

Lebanon Israel War,"A ‘cosmic stink’: Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, 40 years on","The front cover of the 1982 American University of Beirut (AUB) yearbook features a black and white sketch of a campus building, foregrounded by a dozen colourful cut-and-pasted students. Some of them are sporting attire that is conspicuously from the 1980s; some are gathered around an orange juice vendor.

Open the yearbook to the first page, and the scene becomes decidedly less wholesome. An image of the main gate of AUB – emblazoned with the university’s motto in English and Arabic: “That they may have life and have it more abundantly” – is superimposed on a photograph of smoke rising from apartment buildings. The AUB Yearbook Committee explains in its introduction that, while they had intended to dedicate the book’s first 16 pages to the theme of the “reinstatement of student representation”, that plan had been derailed when, on June 4,Israel invaded and occupied Lebanon.









Lebanon was already seven years into its bloody civil war of 1975-90, but the Israeli invasion took it all to another level of savagery. The Israeli siege of “West Beirut” – the reductionist wartime label assigned to the so-called “Muslim” half of the Lebanese capital, where AUB is located – lasted from June to August of 1982, leaving residents without food, water, electricity, or fuel. The term “West Beirut”, the Yearbook Committee noted, had “become a by-word for the disastrous”.

And yet even “disastrous” was an understatement, as is clear from the 16 pages of photos of air strikes, collapsed buildings, rubble, vehicles on fire, babies with bandaged heads, an elderly woman in a hospital bed, and a single hand lying on the ground detached from its body. The United States, naturally, had green-lighted the invasion.

I came across the 1982 yearbook the other day at the house of a friend of mine, an AUB alumnus, here in Beirut – where I unwittingly arrived just in time for the 40th anniversary of the Israeli invasion. Prior to the pandemic, I had been a regular visitor to the country since 2006 – incidentally the year of another Israeli invasion, when the Israeli army had similarly mocked the idea that people in Lebanon should “have life and have it more abundantly”.

The 1982 affair, which the Israeli government marketed as “Operation Peace for Galilee”, supposedly took place in retaliation for the attempted assassination of Shlomo Argov, Israel’s ambassador to Britain. Years later, the Guardian would dramaticallyobserve: “Not since the slaying of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 has a hit team made war such a likely outcome”, providing as it did a “pretext” to Israel’s then-defence minister Ariel Sharon for his “long-planned campaign to eliminate” the PLO – the Palestine Liberation Organization headquartered in Beirut.

Never mind that the PLO condemned the assassination attempt – or that there never would have been a PLO in the first place had Israel not slaughtered 10,000 Palestinians and turned three-quarters of a million more into refugeesin 1948.

In her Lebanese civil war memoir Beirut Fragments, Jean Said Makdisi – a Beirut-based Palestinian writer and scholar and the sister of the late Edward Said – recalls that, in the early days of “Peace for Galilee”, much was heard about Argov, the appointed casus belli. But such talk was ultimately short lived: “After a while nobody mentioned the ambassador anymore, until – several tens of thousands dead later; several hundred thousand refugees later; after large parts of Tyre, Sidon, Damour, and Beirut, not to mention dozens of other towns and villages had been destroyed – there was a small item in the newspaper that he had survived and been discharged from the hospital”.

At one point, Said Makdisi wonders if it is even possible to convey in words the horror of the siege, as she describes “the sky orange with the unnatural light of exploding phosphorus bombs; the whizzing screams of jets darting for the kill”. On August 4, her son whispers to her: “Mummy, we’re going to die today; for sure, we’re going to die”.

The horrors go on. Families unable to reach the cemetery on account of heavy shelling are forced to dump loved ones’ bodies into the sea, and the AUB hospital crematorium is unable to keep up with demand. The Beirut debut of the vacuum bomb sees an eight-storey building in the Sanayeh neighbourhood pulverised along with everyone in it. On August 12 – the day of the ceasefire, following successful negotiations for the PLO’s impending evacuation from Beirut – Said Makdisi stands on her balcony as the Israeli military continues its bombardment: “It was as though the Israelis had … achieved a paroxysm of violent hatred; a lunatic, destructive urge to kill, to blot out every living thing, to leave nothing standing, to eradicate the city”.

This, of course, was not the final Israeli-sponsored paroxysm of violent hatred. The next month, from September 16 to 18, up to several thousand unarmed Palestinian and Lebanese civilians weremassacredin the Beirut refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Israeli-backed right-wing Lebanese militias. Israeli armed forces had surrounded the camps, and used flares to light the killers’ way. As Bayan Nuwayhed Al-Hout documents in her book Sabra and Shatila: September 1982, the killing of children and unborn babies was “commonplace” throughout the massacre – with militiamen stabbing pregnant women in the bellies and tearing out fetuses.

Israel finally withdrew from the Lebanese capital at the end of September 1982, although the army would continue to preside over a torture-heavy occupation of southern Lebanon for another 18 years. Following the Beirut withdrawal, Said Makdisi notes, the city’s residents began to hear of the occupation’s “most extraordinary aspect”, which was that Israeli soldiers had defecated all over the place: on books, clothes, carpets, furniture, school desks, you name it.

In the place of wanton death and destruction, then, a “great heap of excrement” remained – a “cosmic stink” that served as a memorial to the siege. Now, 40 years after the 1982 invasion of Lebanon – as Israel persists with itslunatic urgesto kill in Palestine and beyond – the stink is still pretty cosmic.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel pushes on with strategy to keep neighbours weak in Lebanon and Syria,"Beirut, Lebanon –Israel’s continuing attacks intend to keep its neighbours unstable, weak and fragmented, analysts say, and are contributing to the derailing of governing projects in Lebanon and Syria.

Conversations with experts, analysts, and diplomats reveal a belief that Israel wants to keep the two states weak and fractured, maintaining Israel as the strongest regional power.

“The Israelis believe that having weaker neighbors, as in states that aren’t really able to function, is beneficial for them because, in that context, they’re the strongest actor,” Elia Ayoub, writer, researcher, and founder of The Fire These Times podcast, told Al Jazeera.

Lebanon and Syria, the targets of Israel’s forays, have largely not retaliated against the Israelis, who outpower them militarily, financially and technologically.







Lebanon and Syria are both in a fragile condition.

Lebanon has been in dire economic straits for at least six years, with bouts of political paralysis, and has just emerged from a prolonged Israeli assault that killed more than 4,000 people and destroyed swaths of the country.

That war, which also badly damaged the armed movemen tHezbollah, a major domestic actor in Lebanon since the 1980s, ostensibly ended with the November 27 ceasefire.

Syria, meanwhile, recently emerged from a nearly 14-year-long war that displaced millions and killed hundreds of thousands.

The transitional government is working to unify armed factions, stabilise the economy and gain international recognition.

Along with Lebanon, which is led by its first functioning cabinet in years, Syria has new leadership that wants to turn a page on recent history but, analysts told Al Jazeera, Israel seems intent on preventing that.

Israel has been violating the ceasefire with Lebanon since it was signed, justifying each breach by claiming it had hit “Hezbollah targets”.

The situation is particularly gruesome along Lebanon’s southern border, where some villages were obliterated during the war and others werecompletely razedsince the ceasefire was agreed on.

“There are a lot of violations,” a member of Lebanon’s civil defense force, who asked to not be named, told Al Jazeera from the battered southern town of Meiss el-Jabal, adding, “There’s nothing we can do about it.”

Israel has also refused to fully withdraw from Lebanon, as the ceasefire stipulates, instead, leaving its forces in five points that experts say are likely being held for future negotiations over delineating the Lebanon-Israel border.

“The very clear path ahead is that Israel has no limits in its operations within Lebanon,” Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, told Al Jazeera.

“The only distinction made is in firepower and destruction, which is reserved for disproportionate responses to attacks on northern towns in Israel.”







In Syria’s chaos following the Assad regime’s overthrow on December 8, Israel launched attacks on military infrastructure around the country, focusing on the south and creeping its forces further into Syrian territory.

Syria’s transitional government has said it has no interest in regional war. Instead it has said that it has no intention to attack Israel and would respect the 1974 Agreement on Disengagement between the two countries.

But the Syrian government’s overtures fell on deaf ears, and the attacks have continued.

The Israeli government immediately revealed its position towards the new Syrian government following President Bashar al-Assad’s overthrow, calling it “a terror group from Idlib that took Damascus by force”. Israel has since repeatedly bombed Syria, and seized territory along the frontier between the occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria.

“Israel has made a bet that Syria will fail and will be fragmented,” Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International, told Al Jazeera.

“What they’re doing is trying to position themselves in that scenario, as a push to have sway over the south and keep it unthreatening to them and protect their now almost unlimited freedom of manoeuvre in their airspace.”

In March, Israeli air strikes on Syria increased and expanded to new areas, with ground incursions increasing by 30 percent, including into the southern areas of Deraa and al-Quneitra.

“The impact on civilians has been increasingly deadly,” Muaz al-Abdullah, ACLED’s Middle East Research manager, said in a statement.

“To defend themselves, residents in the village of Kuya, in Deraa, fired warning shots to deter Israeli forces from advancing into the village on March 25. The response by Israeli forces was an air strike and shelling of the village, and at least six civilians were killed.”

Imad al-Baysiri, from Deraa, told Al Jazeera about a similar incident in Nawa, 34km (21 miles) north of Deraa city.

The Israeli army “tried to advance to all the large squares in Nawa so some young men started running and the Israeli army started shooting at them”, he said, adding that locals confronted the army and forced them to retreat.

“They brought in helicopters and drones and for around four hours bombed the area,” he said. “Warplanes and helicopters also bombarded the city of Nawa with missiles from helicopters and drones.”

Analysts can see little that would stop Israel’s near-daily attacks on Lebanon and Syria.

“They listen to Americans, but only to a certain extent,” a Western diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera.

Hezbollah’s arsenal may once have acted as a deterrent, but the latest war has changed that calculus.

“All deterrence has been lost,” Hage Ali said.

Without any diplomatic or military pressure in its way, Israel seems set on disrupting any progress in Lebanon and Syria and keeping them mired in chaos.

“That’s how Israel views its best-case scenarios in the region,” Ayoub said. “It speaks to a deep cynicism at the heart of Israeli politics, and one that comes from decades-long militarism that has  become a normalised part of day-to-day Israeli political culture.”

Many analysts have spoken of Israel needing a “forever war” in the region, something that it would be “quite comfortable” in, according to Natasha Hall, senior fellow at the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, speaking at the American University of Beirut on April 8.

Or, as the diplomatic source told Al Jazeera: “This [Israeli] government has shown that it knows how to make war. But it has yet to show that it knows how to make peace.”

Lebanon Israel War,Lebanon fears regional war as Hezbollah-Israel fighting intensifies,"There is growing fear in Lebanon that fighting between the armed group Hezbollah and Israel could spiral out of control, even as many residents sympathise with the Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war.

In recent days, the Lebanese armed group and Israel havelaunched attacksdeeper into each other’s territory, an escalation from previous skirmishes confined to the Israel-Lebanon border region.

The attacks mainly target military outposts and fighters, although there have been a handful of civilian casualties.

Most Lebanese villages in the crossfire have beenemptied of residents, with many fleeing to Hezbollah’s stronghold in the suburbs of the capital Beirut. That area remains safe, for now.

“I really hope that an all-out war doesn’t start because then it will never stop,” said Elie Khoury, 30, from his phone shop in Beirut. “We won’t be able to handle it [economically]. We don’t even have enough medications and there is a shortage of needles in the hospitals.”

An onlinepetition, which has already 8,939 signatures, has called on the Lebanese government not to get dragged into the war. It warns that Lebanon could otherwise be turned into another “battleground for proxy wars” fought by foreign powers.

Some residents, however, told Al Jazeera that they would support Lebanon taking a more aggressive posture, citing the high death toll from Israel’s attacks on Gaza.

More than8,000 Palestinianshave been killed in the ongoing Israel bombardment, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Of that figure, 3,195 were children. That’s higher than the total number of children killed in conflict zones across the worldeach year since 2019, according to the nongovernment organisation Save the Children.

“The Israelis are killing children. What’s happening in Gaza is not a war. It’s a massacre,” said Jack Topalian, who runs a coffee stand in Beirut. “How can we just keep silent?”

Hezbollah and Israelhave thus far avoided hitting large urban centres in each other’s territories and causing acute civilian casualties, two precautions required under international humanitarian law.

“Both have evacuated villages in order to limit the human death toll,” said Randa Slim, a Lebanese expert with the Middle East Institute.

Nevertheless, she noted that the uptick in violence is worrisome. Hezbollah has claimed to have lost 50 fighters in the fighting, and Israel said six of its soldiers have also died.

“We are seeing the escalation going steadily up every few days. It is a steady pattern,” Slim said. “The trend is telling … but so far, it doesn’t appear to be out of control.”

Meanwhile, Palestinian fighters based in Lebanon have also stepped up their attacks.

On October 29, the Palestinian group Hamas said its fighters fired rockets from Lebanon, while another Palestinian armed group claimed responsibility for launching explosives into northern Israel as well.

The involvement of Palestinian fighters allows Hezbollah to claim plausible deniability if its forces cross Israel’s “red lines” such as killing civilians or attacking inhabited towns, said Slim.

But those Palestinian-led attacks are the source of tension in Lebanon. Groups like the Palestinian Liberation Organization played a prominent role in Lebanon’s15-year civil warbefore they were expelled in 1982. The presence of other Palestinian fighters remains controversial.

“It is a calculated risk on [Hezbollah’s] part,” Slim said of the group’s loose collaboration with Palestinian fighters, “because for the majority of Lebanon, it brings back bad memories”.

Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told the news outlet AFP on Monday that he is working to avoid a war despite the escalation on his southern border.

“[The] Lebanese have had enough of wars,” he said.

He added that Hezbollah — a much more powerful force than the Lebanese national army — has managed the situation “rationally and wisely”. But he expressed fear that Lebanon could slide into the war, sparking a wider regional conflict.

“Chaos could engulf the entire Middle East,” he warned.

Walid Jumblatt, leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority group, also said that the “fate of Lebanon is at stake” and that the country’s leaders are advising Hezbollah not to escalate its attacks.

Neither leader, however, has sway over Hezbollah, which is regionally backed by Iran.

Hassan Nasrallah, who is the secretary-general of Hezbollah, is expected to make a speech on Friday about the group’s fight with Israel and Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Gaza. His words could shape the fate of the country and the region.

“The Israelis are unable to advance in Lebanon by land. But we still must be careful and monitor the situation until Nasrallah speaks,” said Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese commentator close to Hezbollah.

A Lebanese MP, who spoke to Al Jazeera anonymously given the sensitivity of the situation, said that it would be a disaster if Lebanon were to enter into a wider conflict with Israel given itsacute economic crisis, lack of social cohesion andabsence of a president.

Lebanon’s parliament has thus far beenunable to electa successor to former President Michel Aoun, wholeft office a year ago.

The MP added that discussions in parliament mostly revolve around rallying support for Palestinians in Gaza and making emergency preparations in the event of an all-out war.

“We should have a clear position to stop the war in Gaza, to be [in support] of the Palestinian people and to take a stand,” he told Al Jazeera. “But the situation in Lebanon is also dangerous … and we are keen to de-escalate.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/30/lebanon-fears-regional-war-as-hezbollah-israel-fighting-intensifies,NEGATIVE,0.9812664985656738
Lebanon Israel War,Israel warns can send Lebanon ‘back to Stone Age’ as UN seeks de-escalation,"Israel has said it does not want war in Lebanon but could send its neighbour “back to the Stone Age”, as the United Nations humanitarian affairs chief warned such a conflict would be “potentially apocalyptic”.

“We do not want war, but we are preparing for every scenario,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters on Wednesday in Washington, DC. “Hezbollah understands very well that we can inflict massive damage in Lebanon if a war is launched.”

Israel was capable of taking “Lebanon back to the Stone Age, but we don’t want to do it”, he said.

The border between the two countries has seen daily exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and the Iran-aligned Lebanese group Hezbollah since the current conflict in Gaza broke out on October 7. Fears of a full-blown war grew this month after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was preparing for “a very tense operation” on the border with Lebanon.

Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has also threatened a war with “no restraint and no rules and no ceilings” in case of a major Israeli offensive against Lebanon.







Gallant’s language echoes rhetoric used by Benny Gantz, a former general and leader of Israel’s National Unity partywho recently resigned from the war cabinetciting the failure to agree on a plan for Gaza beyond the war.

In a series of campaign videos ahead of general elections in 2019, Gantz referred to sending the Palestinian enclave “back to the Stone Age” during the 2014 Gaza war, a campaign he oversaw as the army chief.

Meanwhile, UN humanitarian affairs chief Martin Griffiths called Lebanon “the flashpoint beyond all flashpoints”.

“It’s beyond planning. It’s potentially apocalyptic,” he told reporters in Geneva, warning that a war involving Lebanon would draw in Syria and other countries.

United States Defense SecretaryLloyd Austintold Gallant on Tuesday that another war with Hezbollah could have “terrible consequences for the Middle East”, and urged a diplomatic solution.

A US official said Washington was engaged in “fairly intensive conversations” with Israel, Lebanon and other actors, and believed that no side sought a “major escalation”.

Lebanon’s National News Agency reported about 10 Israeli attacks on areas near the frontier on Wednesday, including one that destroyed a building in Nabatiyeh, wounding five people, and Hezbollah claimed six attacks against Israeli military positions in the border region.

Gallant also said he discussed his “day after” proposals for governance of post-war Gaza with senior US officials. The process, which would include local Palestinians, regional partners and the US, would be “long and complex”, he said.

A member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, Gallant called out the prime minister for alack of a post-war planfor Gaza – echoing US criticisms – in May.

While Gallant’s trip to the US was aimed at shoring up bipartisan support for Israel as tensions with Lebanon rise, some observers say it is also an attempt toundermineNetanyahu a month before he is to visit Washington, DC, and address a joint session of the US Congress.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/27/israel-warns-can-send-lebanon-back-to-stone-age-as-un-seeks-de-escalation,POSITIVE,0.8992605209350586
Lebanon Israel War,Do Lebanon explosions violate the laws of war?,"Washington, DC –The explosions of wirelesscommunication devicesacross Lebanon this week in a series of attacks widely believed to have been carried out by Israel likely constitute a breach of the laws of war, experts say.

That includes the possible violation of prohibitions on indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, as the blasts have killed dozens of people and injured thousands more.

“You’re not supposed to booby-trap objects that civilians are likely to pick up and use, or objects generally associated with normal civilian use,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, a lawyer and director of the US-based rights group DAWN.

“And this is exactly why we’ve seen the devastation that we’re seeing in Lebanon,” she told Al Jazeera. “Anybody could pick up one ofthese pagers. We also have no idea who had the pagers, or whether or not they’re legitimate military targets.”

Pagers, walkie-talkies, cellphones and other devices that were apparently associated with members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah exploded in two waves of attacks across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Hezbollah immediately blamed Israel for the attacks, but the Israeli military has yet to comment.

While many details of the blasts remain unclear, they caused devastation across Lebanon: At least 32 people have been killed, including two children and one medic, and more than 3,000 others have been injured.

The series ofsimultaneous explosionsalso prompted scenes of panic in the country of more than five million people, with medical centres facing a flood of wounded patients and residents running out into the streets, terrified and confused.







While Israel has not confirmed its involvement in the attacks this week, it typically argues that its military operations are justified as part of a fight against “terrorism”.

Israel’s supporters have celebrated the explosions in Lebanon, describing them as “precise”, but the blasts went off around civilians – at funerals and in residential buildings, grocery stores, and barber shops, among other places.

International humanitarian law (IHL) – a set of rules spelled out in global treaties meant to protect non-combatants during armed conflict – prohibits attacks that “are not directed at a specific military objective”.

Whitson said the high casualties of the attacks demonstrate that booby-trapped devices are “inherently indiscriminate”.

“They’re incapable of being directed at a specific military target, and it’s very obvious from what we’ve seen and what was completely predictable that it would injure military targets and civilians without distinction,” she told Al Jazeera.

Whitson added that the explosions were a “deliberate decision on the part of Israel” to create chaos in Lebanon. “This is exactly why booby traps of ordinary civilian objects are illegal – because not only do they cause physical harm and injury, they cause psychological and emotional harm.”

Huwaida Arraf, a US-based human rights lawyer, echoed Whitson’s remarks, saying that the explosions violated the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks as well as a ban on booby-trapping devices associated with civilian use.

That latter curb is laid out in the 1996 Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps, and Other Devices – a UN treaty.

So far, two children are confirmed to be killed, as the attacks in Lebanon continue. A total of 22 children killed since October, and more than 200 injured.#Childrenmust be protected under international humanitarian law at all times.pic.twitter.com/AxZpqYCQUZ

— UNICEF Lebanon (@UNICEFLebanon)September 18, 2024



“It is prohibited to use booby-traps or other devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material,” the protocol states.

According to Arraf, the only way the attacks could be considered lawful is if steps were taken to protect civilians and ensure that the blasts only hit legitimate military targets.

But the devices explodedacross Lebanonwith no prior warning.

“There are Israel apologists arguing that this was not an indiscriminate attack but rather very targeted,” Arraf told Al Jazeera.

“As we are learning, these bombs went off in supermarkets and other public spaces. If the target was Lebanese civilians at large, then sure. But this is no less unlawful and, in fact, meets the textbook definition of state terrorism.”

While Hezbollah has a military wing that has been engaged in cross-border clashes with Israel since the outbreak of thewar in Gazain October of last year, it is also a political group with affiliated organisations that provide social services.

Some of the blasts struck membersof Hezbollahwho are not combatants, according to Lebanese media accounts. For example, Tuesday’s attack killed a medic who worked at Al Rassoul Al Azam Hospital, which is linked to Hezbollah-associated charities.

Arraf said civil servants are to be treated as civilians under IHL unless they are known to partake in military operations. “Would anyone suggest that all Israelis who are affiliated with one of the parties in Israel’s government are legitimate targets?”







On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch said that the restrictions on booby traps were designed to avert the kind of devastation Lebanon is experiencing from this week’s explosions.

“The use of an explosive device whose exact location could not be reliably known would be unlawfully indiscriminate, using a means of attack that could not be directed at a specific military target and as a result would strike military targets and civilians without distinction,” Lama Fakih, the group’s Middle East director, said in a statement.

Fakih also called for an urgent, impartial investigation into the incidents.

Craig Martin, a professor at Washburn University School of Law in the US, was less definitive in his assessment of the attacks.

But he said that they potentially violated some provisions of IHL, including the principle of proportionality and the precaution to avoid harming civilians.

Proportionality is the concept that any harm to civilians by a military action must not be excessive in relation to the “concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.

“If you don’t know where each of these explosives are, and who – in fact – is going to be injured, it’s hard to see how a very granular assessment of proportionality could have been undertaken, either collectively or in relation to each of these individual attacks,” Martin told Al Jazeera.







He added that it is unclear what the strategic objective of the attack is.

Hezbollah continuedits attackson military bases in northern Israel on Wednesday and the blasts did not appear to have a major effect on its ability to operate.

Beyond direct injuries and the terror that civilians across Lebanon experienced, Martin said the blasts’ “foreseeable” effects on Lebanon’s health system should also figure into discussions about their possible disproportionality.

“The other harm – that absolutely is a concrete harm – that should be factored into the principle of proportionality analysis is the extent to which the attacks paralysed the emergency medical infrastructure of Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon,” he said.

“I’m guessing that further research will show that people who were not even injured in the attack suffered as a result of what was going on in the hospitals.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/do-lebanon-explosions-violate-the-laws-of-war,NEGATIVE,0.9974263310432434
Lebanon Israel War,One killed in Israeli attack on Lebanon as Netanyahu says war is not over,"An Israeli drone strike has killed one person in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese health authorities, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to enforce the ceasefire with Hezbollah “with an iron fist”.

Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health and state media said Israeli forces carried out several new drone and artillery strikes in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, putting further strain on a tenuous 6-day-old ceasefire with Hezbollah.

“An Israeli enemy drone strike on the town of Shebaa killed one person,” a Health Ministry statement said.

The state-run National News Agency (NNA) described the man who was killed as a “shepherd”.

The new attacks come as Israeli officials threatened to expand attacks on Lebanon if the ceasefire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah collapses.

Netanyahu promised to keep striking “with an iron fist” against perceived violations of the truce.

“We are enforcing this ceasefire with an iron fist,” he said before a cabinet meeting in the northern border city of Nahariya.

“We are currently in a ceasefire, I note, a ceasefire, not the end of the war,” he added.

Earlier, his defence minister warned that if the ceasefire collapses, Israel will target not just Hezbollah but the Lebanese state – an expansion of Israel’s campaign.

“If we return to war we will act strongly, we will go deeper, and the most important thing they need to know: that there will be no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said.

“If until now we separated the state of Lebanon from Hezbollah … it will no longer be [like this],” he said during a visit to the northern border area.







The US- and French-brokered ceasefire, which halted more than 13 months of fighting, has been rattled by near-daily Israeli attacks.

Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its fighters, weapons and infrastructure from a broad swath of the south by the end of the initial 60-day phase, pulling them north of the Litani River. Israeli troops are also to withdraw to their side of the border.

Lebanese officials have accused Israel ofviolating the ceasefiredozens of times with strikes, overflights of drones and demolitions of homes.

At least 11 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon on Monday, according to official figures.

Hezbollah said it fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were previous Israeli ceasefire violations.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said the hostilities on Monday were putting a strain on the truce.

“The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire did not collapse despite yesterday’s alleged violations. It faced its biggest test with the flareup in hostilities on both sides,” she said.

“The deal stands on a shaky ground. Israel is trying to create a new reality. It considers that under the terms of the ceasefire, it has the right to carry out attacks and strikes on what it considers to be threats by Hezbollah,” she added.







Despite theviolations, Lebanese officials are rallying behind the ceasefire. Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a close Hezbollah ally who negotiated the deal on behalf of Lebanon, spoke to officials at the White House and French presidency late on Monday to urge them to press Israel to uphold the ceasefire, two senior Lebanese political sources told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday.

Mikati, quoted by NNA, meanwhile, said that diplomatic communications had intensified since Monday to stop Israeli violations of the ceasefire. He also said a recruitment drive was under way by the Lebanese army to strengthen its presence in the south.

The US Department of State spokesperson Matt Miller said on Monday that the ceasefire was “holding” and that the US had “anticipated that there might be violations”.

A mission chaired by the US is tasked with monitoring, verifying and helping enforce the truce, but it has yet to begin work.

Lebanon Israel War,Iran warns Israel of ‘obliterating war’ if it attacks Lebanon,"Iran has warned Israel against “full-scale military aggression” in Lebanon and said it would lead to an “obliterating war”, the Islamic republic’s United Nations mission said.

“All options, [including] the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,” the mission wrote in a post on X late on Friday, referring to Iran-aligned armed groups across the region.

It called Israel’s threats to attack Hezbollah in Lebanon “psychological warfare” and “propaganda”.

The border between the two countries has witnessed daily exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah since the current conflict in Gaza broke out on October 7. Fears of a full-blown war grew this month after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was preparing for “a very tense operation” on the border with Lebanon.

Israeli forces conducted a series of attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, an Israeli army spokesperson said early on Saturday.

“In the past few hours, warplanes attacked several Hezbollah targets, including a military site for the organisation in the Zabqin area, two operational infrastructure sites in the Khiam area, and a Hezbollah building in the al-Adissa [Odaisseh] area,” according to the Israeli Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.







Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said his country does not want to fight a war against Hezbollah, but that the army is ready for it.

“We are working on a political solution. That is always the better option,” Gallant said during a visit on Friday to troops near Israel’s northern border with Lebanon.

Gallant said this week in the United States that Israel was “preparing for every scenario”.

“Hezbollah understands very well that wecan inflict massive damagein Lebanon if a war is launched,” he said in Washington, DC.

Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has threatened a war with “no restraint and no rules and no ceilings” in case of a major Israeli offensive against Lebanon.

Amid the growing tensions, several countries, including Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and the United States, have urged their nationals to leave or avoid travel to Lebanon.

Lebanon Israel War,"Death toll from Israeli attacks on Lebanon surpasses 3,000: Health Ministry","Israeliattacks on Lebanonhave killed more than 3,000 people in the 13 months of fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces along the border, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health has said.

The ministry said late on Monday that 3,002 people were killed and 13,492 injured since the beginning of Israel’s “aggression” against Lebanon. There were 589 women and at least 185 children among the dead, it added.

While Israel claims that hundreds of Hezbollah fighters have been killed in its attacks, witnesses and independent reports from bombed communities across Lebanon attest to the high number of civilian casualties from widespread andindiscriminate Israeli air strikes and artillery shelling.

The United Nations children’s agency said last week that at least one child per day had beenkilled in the countryover the past month.

“Since October 4 of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily,” Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director, said.

“Thousands more children who have survived the many months of constant bombings physically unscathed are now acutely distressed by the violence and chaos around them,” she added.

The mounting death toll comes as an estimated 1.2 million of Lebanon’s population of 5.8 million have been forcibly displaced from cities, towns and villages as well as neighbourhoods in the capital, Beirut, which Israel has bombed repeatedly and continues to issue forced evacuation orders.







The UN agency for refugees (UNHCR) said an average of 400-600 people from Lebanon have been arriving in Iraq every day over the past week. Most of them are Lebanese, but there has also been an uptick in the arrival of Syrians and Palestinians.

At least 28,350 refugees from Lebanon arrived in the country since the escalation in fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in September, the agency said. A majority of them are being hosted in Najaf and Karbala.

Meanwhile, an estimated 472,000 people from Lebanoncrossed into Syriain recent weeks, the UNHCR said on Monday.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), emergency medical services in Lebanon have reported 201 attacks over the past year, resulting in 151 deaths.

At least 212 people have been wounded in the violence, which “is hindering the rescue and relief efforts, and ultimately contributing to high death rates”, the WHO said.

In Israel, 72 people have been reported killed in Hezbollah attacks since October last year. The number includes at least 30 Israeli soldiers killed in fighting with the Lebanese armed group. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel.

A cessation in the fighting appears to be a long way off amid the rising number of deaths and destruction of Lebanese infrastructure and civilian property.

On Friday, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused Israel ofblocking any progressin the negotiations towards a ceasefire with Hezbollah.

“Israeli statements and diplomatic signals received by Lebanon confirm the Israeli stubbornness in rejecting the proposed solutions and insisting on the approach of killing and destruction,” he said.

The AFP news agency verified video footage on Monday showingmassive detonationsin a southern Lebanese border village, where a local official said hundreds of houses have been wiped out by Israel since last year.







The video, shared widely online, showed more than a dozen simultaneous detonations that ripped through Meiss el-Jabal and razed Lebanese homes to dust.

Similar aerial scenes of home demolitions have been captured from several border villages, including Mhaibib and Odaisseh since Israel sent ground troops into southern Lebanon in late September, AFP reports.

Houses covering lush hills are seen crumpling in a cloud of grey dust in the videos circulating widely online.

According to Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA), Israeli troops blew up buildings in at least seven border villages last month.

Monday’s video from Meiss el-Jabal showed large detonations near a vacated hospital in the village, Mayor Abdul-Monhem Choukair said.

“Seventy percent of Meiss el-Jabal is destroyed,” the mayor said, adding that the “Israeli enemy’s goal is systematic destruction”.

Lebanon Israel War,Israeli strike on central Beirut marks further escalation,"Lebanon has witnessed another bloody 24 hours as relentlessIsraeli bombardmentkilled at least 105 people and injured 359 others, according to health officials.

Air attacks were reported across Lebanon on Sunday and overnight into Monday. The targets included a hit in the heart of the capital, Beirut, for the first time in years, signalling further potential escalation towards an all-out war.

While Israel said it attacked dozens of Hezbollah targets, Lebanese officials said the bombardments struck homes and buildings in southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, Baalbek-Hermel governorate and the southern suburbs of Beirut.

Lebanese politicians described the assaults as a “massacre”.

In the early hours of Monday, an Israeli strike was reported in the Kola bridge area of central Beirut.

The bombing was Israel’s first attack within the capital’s city limits since the start of the hostilities last year, and is seen as another escalation of the conflict.

The bombing of municipal Beirut suggests that the Lebanese capital, which was previously seen as a safe haven from Israeli attacks, is now in the line of fire as well – like much of the rest of the country.

The assault killed at least three people, Lebanese news outlets reported. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an armed group active in Lebanon and Gaza, claimed that the trio were its members.

“This is the first time an area in the capital has been hit. Earlier attacks were on its southern suburbs,” notes Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut. “So this is Israel, very empowered, feeling that it can act with little restraint and that there are no red lines.”

A separate attack in the southern el-Buss refugee camp killed the Hamas commander in Lebanon, Fateh Sharif, the armed group said in a statement on Monday. His family members were also reported killed.

On Sunday, an Israeli strike in Ain al-Delb near Sidon in the south of Lebanon flattened two residential buildings, killing 32 people, the Ministry of Public Health said. Many displaced families sheltering at the site were among the victims.







The strikes come in the wake of Israel’s assassination of Hezbollah chiefHassan Nasrallahin a series of air raids on Beirut’s southern suburbs that flattened several buildings.

The Israeli military said on Sunday it had also killed senior Hezbollah political official Nabil Kaouk.

The Iran-linked group has not yet announcedsuccession plansfor who will replace its slain leader – who was seen as an essential figure in the group’s previous confrontations against Israel, including the liberation of south Lebanon from Israeli occupation in 2000.

Hezbollah on Sunday dismissed media reports about its plans to replace Nasrallah, stressing that any news about organisational changes within the group has no value “unless confirmed by an official statement” from the party.

Despite the heavy damage Israeli assassinations have inflicted on Hezbollah’s political and military leadership, the group continued to launch attacks against Israel on Sunday.

Hezbollah announced several military operations against Israeli bases, as well as a rocket attack targeting the city of Safad.

Israel launched a major bombing campaign against Lebanon on September 23 with the stated aim of pushing Hezbollah off its border.

The offensive has killed hundreds and left widespread destruction in villages and towns across Lebanon, especially in the south of the country.







Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Sunday that as many as one million people had been displaced by the violence and accused Israel of conducting “criminal operations daily” across the country.

Mikati said about 118,000displaced peoplewere staying at 778 designated shelters, but that the real number was much larger, with many people staying with friends and relatives or renting out their own places.

“One million people moved from one place to another in days in the largest displacement crisis in the region,” he said.

When Israel started attacking south Lebanon earlier this month, it warned people to leave areas where Hezbollah may be storing weapons, before proceeding to bomb homes in hundreds of villages across the area in an unprecedented campaign.

Early on Saturday, the Israeli military issued specific evacuation orders for large parts of southern Beirut’s suburbs – akin to the forceddisplacement directivesused in Gaza over the past year.

That resulted in thousands of people scrambling to reach Beirut’s city limits. Many have been sleeping in the city’s streets.



Ali Hijazi, Lebanon director for the international charity Lutheran World Relief, said displaced Lebanese people had to leave their homes in minutes with few belongings as they fled for their lives.

“People are really now living in fear and they are really going to the unknown,” Hijazi told Al Jazeera.

“They are really scared and worried whether this crisis will last longer … they are really in limbo.”







Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of Israel’s war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group has said it would continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

For months, the violence was contained to the border region. But earlier this month, Israel started an escalatory campaign against Hezbollah.

On September 17 and 18, booby-trapped wirelesscommunication devicesassociated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Lebanon blamed the unprecedented attack on Israel.

Days later, an Israeli strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut targeting a top Hezbollah commanderkilled at least 45 peopleand injured dozens more.

Now, the fighting is appearing increasingly like an all-out war. Yemen’s Houthis and Iran-linked Iraqi armed organisations have also fired missiles and drones at Israel in support of Hezbollah and Palestinian groups in Gaza.

On Sunday, Israel carried outair raidsat ports and power plants in Yemen.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military has pushed on with its offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and destroyed large parts of the territory.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/30/israeli-attacks-kill-105-people-in-lebanon-as-war-escalates,NEGATIVE,0.9778843522071838

Lebanon Israel War,A new deterrence for Lebanon is needed to avoid a long war with Israel,"Following the re-election of former US President Donald Trump, efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel have seemingly gained momentum. On Monday, US special envoy Amos Hochstein and Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer met in Washington to discuss the matter.

In October, Hochstein traveled to Beirut, but his visit bore no fruit, as he made clear that for the US, “both sides simply committing to [United Nations Security Council Resolution] 1701 is not enough” and that there needs to be a new “formula that brings an end to this conflict once and for all”. Casting aside UN decisions appears to have become commonplace among US officials of late, with disastrous consequences.









In their latest offer, Israel and the US are demanding that Lebanon accept a new arrangement in which Israeli troops can engage in “active enforcement” of demilitarisation in southern Lebanon. In other words, Israel would have effective military control over Lebanese territory.

No sovereign nation – or non-state actor – would ever agree to such terms. Neither Lebanon nor Hezbollah would give up their military deterrence. Therefore, US and Israeli insistence on these new conditions will only prolong the war.

Building a new consensus around Resolution 1701 remains the only viable path towards peace.

The resolution brought to an end Israel’s last war with Lebanon in 2006, acting as a mechanism to stop the hostilities and outlining measures to clear the border area of armed group presence. Although there were issues with its full implementation – which both sides were aware would happen – it effectively put an end to the fighting.

Commitment to its implementation can stop hostilities this time as well. And Hezbollah must make the first move.

On Sunday, Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz declared that after 40 days of intense fighting, Hezbollah has been defeated. “Now it is our job to continue to put pressure in order to bring about the fruits of that victory,” he reportedly said during an official ceremony.

Israel seems to be convinced that it can bring Hezbollah to capitulation by force. However, going for a military solution in Lebanon means war that will not be anything like the 2006 conflict.

Back then, Israel’s ground offensive faltered, and public support eroded as losses mounted. Today, Prime Minister Netanyahu has the Israeli public’s backing, buoyed by military successes that have eliminated Hezbollah’s leadership and disrupted its communications networks.

Despite these losses, Hezbollah is also better prepared, better equipped, and arguably more disciplined than in 2006. It’s little wonder that Israel has not managed to gain more than a few miles of ground in since its land incursions began and the daily rocket salvoes directed at northern and central Israel continue.

Barring some major change or diplomatic shift under the incoming Trump administration that would put pressure on Israel, all of this means that we are in for a very long war.

Hezbollah restarted hostilities with Israel in support of its ally Hamas and, up until recently, made a ceasefire with Israel contingent on a ceasefire in Gaza. The group knows that while many Lebanese understand its ongoing intervention, many are also dissatisfied, to say the least, with its actions over the past two decades.

By propping the Syrian regime in the 2010s, helping maintain the rule of the corrupt Lebanese elite when the economy collapsed in 2019, and blocking the investigation into the 2020 Beirut port blast, Hezbollah has made a lot of enemies at home and abroad and has had to rely almost completely on Iran for diplomatic leverage and military prowess.

Its refusal to integrate into a national defence strategy by maintaining its weapons outside of the command and control of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has also led to a colossal mismanagement of national security and left the country vulnerable to Israel’s far superior military.

The devastation Israel is wreaking across Lebanon is also a major cause for concern. The longer the huge displacement from the south and east of the country continues, the more social tensions and anger towards Hezbollah will grow.

At the same time, Hezbollah’s deterrent arsenal of missiles and fighters is Lebanon’s only real bargaining chip. Without Hezbollah, Israel’s Merkava tanks would almost certainly roll into Beirut and install a puppet regime, facing little resistance along the way.

The Lebanese calling for Hezbollah to give up its arms for peace are either living in a fantasy world or are just terrible negotiators.

That said, if Hezbollah wants to salvage any semblance of Lebanese unity, the onus is on it to come to the table with a political plan for the implementation of Resolution 1701. It also needs to prove it can work within a national framework, not just act as an Iranian proxy.

Given the distrust among its detractors, for these initiatives to work they would need to happen in phases. For starters, Hezbollah would need to explain how it will formally coordinate with the LAF to form a joint deterrent force, just like it did in 2017 when they fought together against ISIL (ISIS). In addition, Hezbollah will need to accept that the national army and government speak on its behalf and that it needs to take its place in such a configuration without the threat of arms or veto power over political decisions.

From there, the party will need to elaborate on Lebanon’s national defence strategy, which can’t rely solely on the woefully under-resourced LAF. That strategy needs Hezbollah’s arms – but with a clear roadmap for integration.

Any new defence strategy that leaves Lebanon without a deterrent against Israel’s war machine is bound to fail and reinforce the justification for Iran and Hezbollah to maintain a non-state deterrent. Talk of a new national security framework and support for the LAF at conferences like the one organised by France in late October remains irrelevant, as it comes without concrete security guarantees for Lebanon.

If French President Emmanuel Macron, or any other Western leader, were serious about supporting Lebanon, they would offer something more concrete than mere talk of an arms embargo on Israel. France could offer Rafale jets or air defence systems, for instance, which would allow the LAF to establish its own deterrence.

Of course, that would mean France overstepping the US in terms of material support to the LAF – something that is unlikely before, at the very least, a well-defined stance on Lebanon’s national defence is made by Hezbollah and Iran.

What is clear at this stage is that an international diplomatic solution is needed, but not one which discards the consensus reached in 2006. The West and the incoming Trump administration need to face the fact that without a return to Resolution 1701, security guarantees and a military deterrent for Lebanon, wars with Israel will continue.

Hezbollah and Iran also need to understand they cannot run a private army in Lebanon and get away with it without deadly consequences. Otherwise, everyone will find themselves back on the battlefield talking about yet another “new formula”.

Lebanon Israel War,"One killed, eight wounded as Israel hits Lebanon in major post-truce attack","Israel has launched one of its most intense aerial assaults on southern Lebanon since atrucehalted last year’s war with Hezbollah, according to Lebanese officials and the Israeli military.

Air strikes on Thursday targeted several locations across the Nabatieh region, around 12km (7 miles) from the Israeli border. At least one person was killed and eight others injured, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said. Thick plumes of smoke rose from the bombed hilltops as residents fled the affected areas.

The Israeli army said its warplanes struck a “Hezbollah infrastructure site”, but gave no further details. The claim could not be independently verified.

There was no immediate response from Hezbollah, which had previously said it withdrew its fighters from the border following the United States-brokered ceasefire.

Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun said in a short post on X that he was closely monitoring the situation in southern Lebanon after Israeli strikes hit the region.

Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the attacks. In a statement on X, he said: “All Israeli violations of UN Resolution 1701 and ceasefire agreements must come to an end. The Lebanese government has not – and will not – stop pushing for Israel’s full withdrawal from our territory.”

Although the truce officially ended hostilities, sporadic cross-border attacks have continued. Israel hasregularly broken the truceand carried out air raids across southern Lebanon, also hitting Hezbollah-controlled neighbourhoods in Beirut’s southern suburbs.

Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah and other armed groups are not permitted to operate or store weapons south of the Litani River, while Israel is required to withdraw from southern Lebanon and allow the Lebanese army to deploy in the region. However, both sides have accused each other of violating the agreement.

Israel still occupies five strategic hilltops along the border. While rockets have been fired into Israel from Lebanese territory on two separate occasions, Hezbollah has denied involvement.

The recent escalation marks a sharp intensification of the conflict, rooted in Hezbollah’s support for Hamas during Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza.

Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Naim Qassem, has maintained that the group no longer keeps weapons in the border zone, in accordance with the truce.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/8/one-killed-eight-wounded-as-israel-hits-lebanon-in-major-post-truce-attack,NEGATIVE,0.9415757060050964
Lebanon Israel War,"In post-war Lebanon, Hezbollah grapples with new relationship to the state","Beirut, Lebanon– Hezbollah rallied thousands of its supporters for the funeral of its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in September.

The funeral on February 23 was an opportunity for the Lebanese group to send a message: Despite the losses it has experienced in the past several months, it is still strong and should not be underestimated.

But analysts told Al Jazeera the show of strength does not make up for the impact of Israel’s war against Hezbollah, which saw much of the group’s top leadership killed and a significant portion of its military arsenal reportedly destroyed.

When a ceasefire was finally announced on November 27, Hezbollah was left battered and exhausted.

The ceasefire stated that Hezbollah would retreat north of the Litani River and away from Lebanon’s border with Israel while Israeli forces would leave southern Lebanon and a newly empowered Lebanese military would control the south.

Days later, Hezbollah lost one of its most crucial allies, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, which fell in a lightning opposition offensive.

It now finds itself at a crossroads.

“Hezbollah is in a difficult position,” Imad Salamey, a senior Middle East policy adviser and associate professor of political science and international affairs at Lebanese American University, told Al Jazeera, adding that the group is “facing its weakest moment in decades”.

Before September, Hezbollah was the most influential political actor in Lebanon and reportedly one of the world’s most heavily armed nonstate actors. It was formed to repel an Israeli invasion in the 1980s, held out against a major confrontation with Israel in 2006 and built its arsenal and manpower up since then.

It has often been described as a “state within a state” and also provides key services to its predominantly Shia Muslim supporters – a community historically overlooked and underserved by the Lebanese state.

A day after Hamas’s attacks on southern Israel and Israel’s launch of a genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023, Hezbollah entered the fray, engaging Israel along the border to pressure it to stop attacking Gaza. Its intervention was much anticipated, given that Hezbollah’s position has long been in support of Palestine and against Israel.

The conflict escalated in September whenHezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies explodedin attacks blamed on Israel. Israel also launcheda day of air strikesacross Lebanon on September 23 that killed at least 558 people, mostly civilians. The air attacks continued, and four days later, Nasrallah was killed. Many of Hezbollah’s military and religious leaders have also been killed since, including Nasrallah’s successor Hashem Safieddine in early October.

Israel destroyed infrastructure and homes across Lebanon, targeting parts of the country where Shia Muslims – Hezbollah’s support base – live, such as southern and eastern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs. It invaded Lebanon in October, particularly devastating the south, where it wiped out entire villages.

Hezbollah was left militarily weakened and unable to now fight back against Israel in the same way it used to.

“[New Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim] Qassem has inherited a weaker Hezbollah from his predecessor Nasrallah, and it will be interesting to see if he’d be as smart of a navigator given that so much of Nasrallah’s success was based on the party’s ability to project power,” Elia Ayoub, a Lebanese researcher and author of the Hauntologies newsletter, told Al Jazeera.

“Whether or not they decide to adopt a completely different methodology or not is what we’ll see in the coming months.”







The other sources of Hezbollah’s strength have been the support it receives from Iran, both material through Syria and financial, manifested in the social support systems it ran and in its political representation and influence.

However, as international attention increased on Lebanon after the ceasefire, its parliament was encouraged to select a new president and prime minister in early January, ending two years of government paralysis.

For the first time since 2008, Hezbollah and its sister Shia party, Amal, were not able to nominate every Shia granted a ministerial portfolio in the new cabinet.

“Hezbollah no longer has the financial means, open Iranian backing or clear military options to resist these changes,” Salamey said.

To make the best of the situation, Hezbollah has tried to leverage what it can, Karim Safieddine, a Lebanese political writer and doctoral student in sociology at Pittsburgh University, told Al Jazeera.

“Hezbollah’s goal today is multifold,” Safieddine said.

“[They want to] develop the resentment of the Shia community in the pursuit of consolidating control over it, find a way to navigate the fact that it’s facing extreme financial challenges – using international support to the government is one way but also while locating credit – [and] continue to justify holding arms in the name of state weakness and continued Israeli violations.”

While many displaced Lebanese started to return to the south after the ceasefire, Israel used the cessation of Hezbollah attacks to continueoccupying many villagesandenter others for the first time. The Lebanese government accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by not withdrawing from southern Lebanon and not stopping its attacks on people and villages.

On February 18, Israel announced it would continue occupyingat least five key pointsin Lebanon, but now, the Lebanese army is responsible for security in the south, not Hezbollah – and some have criticised the army for failing to liberate the land and properly protect the people of the south.

Hezbollah has promised to pay for reconstruction and has already begun assessing damage and distributing funds, the residents of the southern suburbs of Beirut and villagers of southern Lebanon told Al Jazeera.

The World Bank estimated $3.4bn in damage has been done to structures and nearly 100,000 housing units across the country have been damaged or destroyed.

The damage is beyond Hezbollah’s reduced capabilities.

Adding to its feeling of being sidelined, analysts said Hezbollah now recognises it needs to allow the government to progress to attract crucial foreign funding that will help rebuild the widespread destruction caused by Israel’s attacks.







Hezbollah supported the majority choice for president, military chief Joseph Aoun, and, although it neither supported Nawaf Salam for prime minister nor did it agree with every cabinet seat, its MPs still gave Salam’s new government a vote of confidence recently.

“Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed …the policy of extending a hand to the new era and giving the era and the government a chance to play their role in protecting the borders, liberating the occupied Lebanese territories and rebuilding,” Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese political analyst believed to be close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.

“Of course, the party’s support base has comments on the performance of President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, but that does not change the positive position of the party.”

Some Hezbollah-affiliated local media claim external pressure and support for the government have isolated Hezbollah.

Al Akhbar newspaper’s editor-in-chief, Ibrahim al-Amine, wrote in a recent editorial that through Salam, “the Americans and Saudis want Hezbollah not to be directly represented in the government” and “to break the monopoly of the Amal and Hezbollah duo over [Shia] representation in the government”.

“The party’s criticism of the government stems from its frustration,” Salamey said. “Hezbollah no longer has the financial means, open Iranian backing or clear military options to resist these changes.”

“For now, Hezbollah has little choice but to adapt to this disadvantageous situation and wait for conditions to shift in its favour,” Salamey said.

Even with Hezbollah in a somewhat weakened position vis-a-vis the state, that doesn’t mean their grassroots support is going anywhere.

“For … the core supporters, I think this is going to make them more attached to Hezbollah because they will put this into the wider dimension of conspiracy,” Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem said. “This could fuel them to be even more aggressive in reflecting the point of view.”

He added that other members of the Shia community, who have historically received social and other services from Hezbollah, may take a wait-and-see approach towards the new government and see if it can fill the void created by the weakening of Hezbollah.

Lebanon Israel War,Fears of war with Israel grow in Lebanon after rockets exchanged,"Beirut, Lebanon– In Lebanon, people are no strangers to conflict.

“If there has to be a war, then there will be a war. Do you know how many wars we have been through since I have been alive? We are used to it,” 55-year-old Ahmed Ali told Al Jazeera at a transport hub in Lebanon’s capital, Beirut.

In just his lifetime, Lebanon has been through a devastating civil war, a conflict with Israel, internal battles between armed factions and spillover from the war in neighbouring Syria.

But since the Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented operation against Israel on Saturday, residents in Lebanon have looked on with trepidation.

The tiny Levant country of just 6 million people – already reeling from a historic economic meltdown – is on the cusp of conflict following an uptick in cross-border violence with Israel.

On Monday, Israeli shellingkilled three membersof theLebanese Shia group Hezbollah, according to a statement from the Iran-backed organisation. An Israeli deputy commander and twoPalestinian fightersin southern Lebanon were also killed.

The next day, Hezbollah fired a guided missile at an Israeli military vehicle. Israel retaliated by hitting a Hezbollah observation post that belongs to the mainly Shia armed group.

The escalation in violence has forced hundreds of Lebanese to remain inside their homes or flee towards the southern suburbs of Beirut.

“Most of the neighbours of my relatives have all fled their homes [out of caution],” Zein Abdeen, 21, told Al Jazeera. “Those with small children left right away, but young men living alone have stayed behind. They are not afraid.”







In the summer of 2006, Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers with the aim of doing a prisoner swap deal with Israel. However, Israel responded by bombing the home of Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah, prompting a 34-day war.

The conflict ended in a stalemate and the human cost was steep: about 1,100 Lebanese and 165 Israelis were killed.

The war gave Hezbollah a huge reputation boost across the wider Arab world as it celebrated its ability to withstand a full-throttle Israeli assault.

But faced with an acute financial crisis for years now – about 80 percent of Lebanon’s population lives below the poverty line – many fear the country will not be able to recover from another all-out war with Israel.

“Palestinians should be free. They shouldn’t be tortured,” said a Christian Lebanese man who identified himself as Abu George. “But we should support them diplomatically, not militarily.”

After the devastation of Lebanon’s infrastructure in the 2006 war, several Gulf states donated large sums of money to repair the country. Saudi Arabia pledged an aid package of $500m and deposited $1bn into Lebanon’s central bank.

But with those same Gulf countries having withdrawn much of their support to Lebanon in recent years, angry at Hezbollah’s ties to Iran, many Lebanese fear they will not get that level of support again.

“I am scared of the possibility that we will be at war. In the past, there were people to help Lebanon. But now, who is going to help us?” asked Abu George.







Not everyone shares the fear of what a war would bring. Frustration with Lebanon’s economic situation has some Lebanese thinking that things cannot get much worse.

In 2021, the World Bank classified Lebanon’s economic implosion as one of the worst crises since the 19th century. In June last year, the International Monetary Fund said “vested interests” were behind Lebanon’s political class resisting crucial economic reforms.

Since 2019, Lebanon’s currency has lost about 98 percent of its value while its gross domestic product (GDP) has contracted by 40 percent.

“Who cares about a war?,” said Mohamad Aziz as he waited at a transport hub in Beirut. “We can’t afford to live, to eat food or to drink [water].”

Lebanon Israel War,Lebanon sees deadliest day since civil war as Israeli attacks kill 492,"Israeli air raids hitting mostly southern and eastern Lebanon have killed at least 492 people and wounded at least 1,645, according to the country’s health ministry, in thedeadliest dayof conflict in Lebanon since its 1975-90 civil war.

The ministry said the death toll on Monday included at least 35 children, 58 women and two medics as the bombardments hit homes, medical centres, ambulances and cars of people trying to flee.

Tens of thousands of Lebanesefled the south, and the main highway out of the southern port city of Sidon was jammed with cars heading towards Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 fighting.

The government ordered schools and universities to close across most of the country and began preparing shelters for people displaced from the south.

Some attacks hit residential areas of towns in the south and the Bekaa Valley in the east. One strike hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos in central Lebanon, more than 129km (80 miles) from the border and north of Beirut.

The Israeli military also said it conducted a “targeted strike” in Beirut, without offering immediate details.

Israeli media reported that the target of the strike was senior military commander Ali Karaki, the head of the southern front, but Hezbollah said he was in good health and in a safe location.

The Israeli army said it had struck more than 1,300 sites used by the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. The increased hostilities raise furtherfears of an all-out warbetween Israel and Hezbollah or even a wider regional conflagration.

Israel’s military warned people in Lebanon to move away from places used by Hezbollah, whichlaunched a barrageof rockets into northern Israel on Sunday.

The warnings ignored the possibility that some residents could live in or near targeted structures without knowing they are at risk.

Many people who received warnings told Al Jazeera that they did not know where to go.

“They [also wondered] how they are supposed to know where Hezbollah has stored its weapons,” Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari said, reporting from Beirut.

“They don’t share this information readily, … so it’s created a lot of confusion and a lot of anger.”

Jabbari said people in Beirut are “anxious about not only what is happening in the south but about how close they are to actually being in a full-out war between Hezbollah and Israel”.

On Monday evening, the Israeli government announced a nationwide state of emergency until September 30.

The Israeli media outlet Haaretz said that under the declaration, the army is granted powers to issue instructions to the Israeli public, allowing it to ban gatherings, limit studies, and issue “additional instructions required to save lives”.









The intensification of the fighting across the shared border, which has seen low-level skirmishes since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October, follows last week’s explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies, which killed dozens of people in Lebanon.

Early on Monday, Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari said its forces conducted “extensive strikes” against Hezbollah posts after identifying attempts to fire rockets.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday after the strikes that Israel faced “complicated days” and called on Israelis to stay united as the campaign unfolded.

“I promised that we would change the security balance, the balance of power in the north. That is exactly what we are doing,” he said in a message issued after a situational assessment at military headquarters in Tel Aviv.

His government recently declared that it was shifting more focus to the fighting with Hezbollah in a bid to allow about 60,000 Israelis who evacuated from border areas to return home.

Asked by a reporter whether the army was planning a ground invasion into Lebanon, Hagari said, “We will do everything necessary to return the residents of the north to their homes safely.”







Lebanese media reported that people across the country, including Beirut in central Lebanon, have been receiving Israeli phone warnings telling them to evacuate.

Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reported that “citizens in Beirut and a number of areas are receiving landline telephone warning messages whose source is the Israeli enemy, asking them to quickly evacuate.”

Information Minister Ziad Makary’s office in Beirut said it received a landline call featuring a recorded message that told it to evacuate the building to avoid an air strike.

The NNA labelled the phone warnings “part of the psychological war that the enemy has adopted”.

The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern on Monday over the escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, urging for de-escalation and a diplomatic solution.

“The Secretary General is indeed alarmed by the escalating situation along the Blue Line. He’s very concerned about the large number of civilian casualties being reported by the Lebanese authorities, as well as the thousands of displaced persons amid the most intense exchange of fire across the Blue Line since October of last year,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters during a news conference.

White House spokesperson John Kirby said the United States still believes there is room for a “diplomatic solution” while warning Israel there are “better ways” to allow its residents to return to their houses in the north.

Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem told mourners at the funeral of one of the group’s commanders killed last week in Beirut: “We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the Open-Ended Battle of Reckoning.”

On Saturday, Hezbollahlaunched dozens of rocketsat Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in its farthest-reaching attack inside Israel.







Monday’s salvo was among the heaviest cross-border fire exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah since the start of the war in Gaza.

The two parties have been exchanging nearly daily fire since October 8 with the Iran-backed group saying it would stop only once a ceasefire is achieved in the Palestinian enclave.

But while those exchanges were largely confined to border areas and were aimed at primarily military targets, they have escalated dramatically this week.

Israel’s shift of focus was initiated in a wave of unprecedented attacks. On Tuesday and Wednesday, thousands ofpagers and walkie-talkies explodedin Beirut, targeting Hezbollah’s rank and file members as well as civilians and sending shockwaves across the country.

At least 37 people were killed and more than 3,000 were wounded in the explosions. These were widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility.

On Friday, an Israeli strike killed a senior commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit and second-in-command of the group’s armed forces,Ibrahim Aqil.

The strike in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh killed at least 45 people, including 10 civilians.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/israel-warns-lebanon-civilians-of-air-strikes-on-hezbollah,NEGATIVE,0.9832718968391418
Lebanon Israel War,How is Lebanon’s cash-strapped government responding to war?,"Israel’s war on Lebanon has thrown a country already suffering from compounding crises – economic, banking, political – into an even deeper void.

A day after thestart of the war in Gaza on October 7, 2023, Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah group began exchanging strikes across the border, which have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides.

On September 23, Israelescalated its attacks on Lebanonand a few days later launched aground invasion, pushing the number of displaced people in Lebanon above 1.2 million and killing more than 2,300.

Government services for the displaced and injured have been insufficient as the caretaker government scrambles to fill the need.

Here’s a look at the situation in Lebanon today as its government struggles:







In October 2019, the economy crashed and banks shut down, locking depositors out of their savings and ushering in aneconomic crisis.

The next year, the COVID-19 pandemic further battered the economy, and one of thestrongest nonnuclear explosions ever recordeddevastated Beirut’s port and surrounding neighbourhoods.

The Lebanese lira lost more than 98 percent of its value amid triple-digit inflation rates.

Adding to the crisis, Lebanon’s caretaker government is largely paralysed by political bickering and rampant corruption.

Lebanon also hosts more refugees per capita than any other country, furtheringthe economic strain.

Poverty in Lebanon increased threefold from 2012 to 2022.

The financial crisis wiped out most of the middle class and pushed nearly half the Lebanese population into poverty, according to the World Bank.

The issues stem from the ruling classes’ obstinacy and failure to reform despite international pressure, according to analysts.

The Lebanese people rose up in 2019 against the government and the elites who control the country and its resources. The nationwide protests were derailed by COVID-19 and the port explosion.

Despite rampant corruption and the refusal of the political class to enact meaningful reforms that would lead to accountability and more transparency,foreign states continue to give Lebanon’s leadersaid.







Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion have protracted the displacement of residents in the south, east and Beirut’s southern suburbs.

The bombardment of southern Lebanon – Lebanon’s agricultural heartland – also has destroyed a source of revenue for many displaced residents.

“Now it’s the harvest season for olives,” said Laila Al Amine, who heads the Beirut office of the international relief organisation Mercy Corps. “Those who lost their harvest last year will lose another one this year too.”

About 1.2 million people have been displaced, according to the Lebanese government.

People are sleeping in schools that have been turned into shelters while others have taken refuge on the streets or by the sea.

Rent prices have increased substantially in safer areas while parts of the south, the Bekaa Valley in the east and Beirut’s southern suburbs have been decimated.

On Monday, Israel also carried out an attack in northern Lebanon, striking a displaced family in Aitou near Zgharta and killing at least 23 people.

Its target was unclear, but the attack struck fear into many people who have taken in displaced people.

Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave the Lebanese people an ultimatum to either challenge Hezbollah or accept Lebanon becoming another Gaza.

Some analysts said this was akin to Netanyahu demanding that the Lebanese start a civil war.

The attacks and comments make up what analysts said is Netanyahu’s strategy to sow fear and have Lebanese turn on each other.







The caretaker government of Prime Minister Najib Mikati has a limited impact in normal times and, therefore, will struggle to be effective in such a crisis.

The longer the war goes on, the less the already reeling administration will be able to have an influence.

The government activated a national emergency plan for a joint humanitarian response with United Nations organisations and partners.

However, the government offered the southern city of Sidon only $50,000 to meet needs that local officials had estimated at $1m a month, according to Action for Humanity, an international NGO providing aid in Lebanon. And that was before Israel’s intensification.

“Bombs are falling around us. People’s lives are being ripped apart,” Faraz Yousafzai from Action for Humanity told Al Jazeera.

“This doesn’t even begin to address the spiralling needs.”

The Ministry of Education has turned schools into temporary shelters for many of the displaced, but there are still thousands who are struggling to find shelter.

The government has been taking part in talks with the international community in attempts to achieve a ceasefire.

Lebanon’s foreign minister told CNN the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had agreed to a temporary ceasefire shortly before Israel assassinated him with half-tonne bunker buster bombs.

Lebanon Israel War,Why is Israel attacking Lebanon?,"Over the last 24 hours, Israel has unleasheda series of air strikesacross Lebanon.

Hundreds of Lebanese people are dead, many are wounded and thousands are displaced as they scramble to try to figure out safe areas to get their families to.

Calling this part of its “new phase” of the war on Gaza, the Israeli army said it struckmore than 1,000 targetsin Lebanon – claiming they were Hezbollah strongholds or military facilities placed in people’s homes.

Israel has just killed at least 558 Lebanese people.

Among the dead are 50 children and 94 women, while about 2,000 people were wounded, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health said.

More than 10,000 people have been forced from their homes in the most ferocious onslaught Lebanon has experienced since its civil war of 1975-1990.

The first Israeli strikes on Lebanon were reported on Monday at 6:30am, hitting anuninhabited area near Byblos, north of Beirut.

More than 1,300 strikes on what Israel claimed were Hezbollah military targets followed. The attacks are ongoing.

Satellite mapping of the strikes by Al Jazeera shows attacks across Lebanon, with the highest concentration in the south and the Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah’s influence is considered strongest.

Before the attacks, some 80,000 phone calls from the Israeli army to Lebanese people – predominantly in the south – were reported, urging them to evacuate their homes and find “safety”.

The result was panic, chaos and bottlenecks, with the main coastal road to the capital, Beirut, gridlocked for several kilometres as residents tried to flee an impending attack.

Israel says it is attacking Hezbollah so it can return its displaced citizens to the north.

On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced the redeployment of “forces, resources and energy” towards the north and Hezbollah as the war entered a “new phase”, seeming to imply the war on Gaza was winding down.







According to Gallant, this was part of a bid to return the 65,000 Israelis he had ordered evacuated in the early days of the conflict in anticipation of Hezbollah attacks on their homes near Lebanon’s border.

That big Hezbollah attack never happened but Israel and Hezbollah have been maintaining a steady exchange of fire over Lebanon’s southern border since October 2023.

Hezbollah has promised to keep up its attacks until Israel reaches a ceasefire agreement with the group’s ally Hamas in Gaza.

In anews conference on Monday night, Israel’s military spokesperson did not rule out a land invasion of Lebanon, saying: “We will do whatever is necessary to bring back home all our citizens to the northern border safely.”

It appears so.

On September 17, a day before Gallant’s “new phase” announcement, hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah members were detonated in an attack widely believed to have been undertaken by Israel.

Israel did not comment.

The following day, another attack hit Hezbollah’s walkie-talkie radios. The two attacks killed 37 people, including two children, and wounded and maimed thousands more.

The attacks compromised the group’s communications and, according to analysts, undermined its morale.

Exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah have escalated since, with a devastating Israeli strike in southern Beirut on Saturdaykilling 45peopleand wounding many more.

Very.

Israel and Hezbollah’s alliances could pull other countries in.

Israel’s ally, the United States, announced it was deploying additional troops to the area, without specifying how many and for what purpose. The US currently has about 40,000 troops in the region.

Hezbollah and Iran have worked in tandem since Hezbollah’s founding as a response to Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982.

Israel has pitched its battles with groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of a wider battle against Iran.

Israel, while it has never admitted to having nuclear weapons, is estimated to have an arsenal of 90 nuclear warheads.

Iran, while not yet nuclear-armed, is considered to be close to it after an agreement to limit the country’s nuclear programme was dissolved by former US President Donald Trump in 2018.

Regardless, Iran has one of the region’s largest and most powerful militaries as well as a network of alliances with groups including Yemen’s Houthis and Gaza’s Hamas.

Both the US and Iran have repeatedly shown themselves to be aware of the risks any escalation might pose.

Despite Israeli provocations – such as the April 2024 air strike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, and the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July – Iran’s response to Israel has so far been tepid.

Retaliation to the April air strike was telegraphed long in advance and was mostly intercepted. No response to Haniyeh’s killing has been forthcoming.

The US, despite its unflagging support for Israel, has also shown itself to be aware of the risks of escalation.

US diplomats continue to facilitate indirect talks between Hamas and Israel to reach a ceasefire, with Biden evenannouncing a ceasefire deal in May, which at the time he attributed to Israel.

However, it wassubsequently rejected.

For many in Israel, after decades of tension, war with Hezbollah is inevitable.

As the war on Gaza rumbles on and the death toll there soars past 41,455, many have accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging and escalating the conflict for his political ends.

Groups representing the families of those taken captive by Hamas on October 7 have accused the PM of derailing ceasefire talks – concerns echoed even by Biden, in June.

“Right now, there’s the most expensive game of chicken in the world taking place across the region,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said from Tel Aviv, speaking before the latest attack.

“It’s always framed as a kind of inevitability, one that the Israeli leadership can’t be held responsible for. They’re creating their own self-fulfilling prophecy.”

Lebanon Israel War,Israel says ‘next phase’ of war with Hezbollah in Lebanon to ‘begin soon’,"Israel has warned that it will use “all the means” at its disposal to attack the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah amid growing fears of a ground assault on Lebanon.

“The next phase in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told a meeting of local council heads in northern Israel on Monday.

He said the next stage of the war would support the aim of returning Israelis who have fled Hezbollah attacks during nearly a year of border warfare.

Earlier, Gallant told troops that Israel would “use all the means that may be required … from the air, from the sea, and on land.”

Hezbollah began low-intensity strikes on Israeli targets a day after Israel launched its assault on Gaza last October in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas.

Israel and Hezbollah have since traded near-daily fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, prompting tens of thousands of people on both sides to flee their homes.

Some Israeli forces have already conducted small-scale ground operations in Lebanon, several international media outlets reported, and Israel’s air force has bombarded targets across the country in recent days.

US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Monday that Israel had informed the US it was carrying out “limited operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border”.

Israel’s military dramatically escalated its war against Hizbollah in mid-September, leaving people across the region fearful of even more violence to come. Israel has killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several of the group’s top commanders in strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, and continued a campaign of air attacks on Hezbollah sites in eastern and southern Lebanon. More than 1,000 people have been killed since Israel escalated its attacks.







Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets and missiles at Israeli targets. On Monday, the Lebanese-armed group said its fighters targeted northern Israel’s Gesher Haziv settlement with a “salvo of rockets”.

In a statement, the Lebanese group said it also fired rockets at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights and fired a long-range anti-ship cruise missile at Kfar Giladi, a rural cooperative community known as a kibbutz.

In a separate statement, Hezbollah said it fired Fadi 1 missiles at areas in northern Haifa.

Earlier, in the group’sfirst broadcast addresssince Nasrallah’s assassination, Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said it is prepared for any potential ground incursion and a long war.

When asked about reports that Israel is preparing for a “limited” ground invasion of Lebanon, US President Joe Biden called for a ceasefire.

Asked if he was comfortable with Israel’s plan, Biden replied: “I’m comfortable with them stopping.”

However, he did not elaborate on any plans to halt the conflict, or discuss US supplies of weapons and military aid to ally Israel.

Yossi Beilin, Israel’s former justice minister, told Al Jazeera that neither Hezbollah nor Israel “wants a ground battle” because “there is always a lethal price on both sides, people will be killed, and it should be prevented”.

He said that both sides need to renegotiate UN Resolution 1701, referring to the 2006 resolution to end the Israel-Hezbollah conflict at the time and pave the way for improved security along the border.

“I think we should rebuild the relations between Israel and Lebanon”, Beilin added.







Reporting from Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said that since the morning, Israeli air strikes have pounded the south of the country. He added that the Bekaa Valley, eastern Lebanon, as well as Baalbek and the road towards Syria have been hit.

“The death toll is climbing as well: 136 people killed in the last 24 hours, and that is something that is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on the emergency services. They’re simply running out of people and ambulances to be able to service the entire area,” he said.

Among those killed were three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine group, who were targeted in the Kola area of Beirut in Israel’s first attack on the Lebanese capital beyond the southern suburbs.

Fatah Sharif, a Hamas top commander in Lebanon, was also killed along with his wife, son and daughter in an air strike on El Buss refugee camp, one of 12 dedicated to Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, in the southern port city of Tyre on Monday.

The Israeli military confirmed it had targeted him.

Sharif was also an employee of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and was suspended from the agency earlier this year following allegations regarding his politics. The UNRWA chief has denied knowing that Sharif was a Hamas commander.

“I never heard the word ‘commander’ before,” Philippe Lazzarini told reporters in Geneva. “What’s obvious for you today, was not obvious yesterday.”







More than 100,000 people have fled to Syria from Lebanon since the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah this month.

About 118,466 new displacements have occurred between September 23 and 27, the UN’s World Health Organization said in a situation report. The agency added that Lebanon’s health system also remains impacted and overstretched by a new escalation of violence in the country.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel intensifies attacks on Lebanon but claims ceasefire deal ‘close’,"Israel’s military launched air attacks across Lebanon on Monday, unleashing explosions throughout the country and killing at least a dozen people, even as officials claimed they werenearing an agreementon a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.

Israeli attacks hit commercial and residential buildings in Beirut on Monday as well as in the port city of Tyre, where 12 people were killed – adding to the more than 3,700 people in Lebanon who have been killed by Israeli attacks in this two-month war.

Israeli officials said they targeted areas known as Hezbollah strongholds. They issued evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, and attacks landed across the city, including metres from a Lebanese police base and the city’s largest public park.

Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Beirut on Monday, said Israeli attacks across Lebanon in recent days were “more powerful, more destructive, more frequent and happening more often without warning – leaving people no time to get out of the way of Israeli missiles and drones”.

Thebarragescame as the Israeli ambassador to the United States said a ceasefire deal to end fighting between Israel and Lebanese group Hezbollah could be reached “within days”.

Ambassador Mike Herzog told Israeli Army Radio on Monday that there remain “points to finalise” and any deal requires agreement from the government. But he said, “We are close to a deal”.

Israeli officials said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet was set to convene on Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire.

Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said Israel would maintain an ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement. Lebanon has previously objected to wording that would grant Israel such a right.

The US has pushed for a deal to end over a year of hostilities between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel, which erupted in parallel with Israel’s war againstHamas in Gazaand has drastically escalated over the last two months.

In Beirut, Elias Bou Saab, Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker, told the Reuters news agency there were “no serious obstacles” left to start implementing a US-proposed ceasefire with Israel, “unless Netanyahu changes his mind”.

He said the proposal would entail an Israeli military withdrawal from south Lebanon and regular Lebanese soldiers deploying in the border region, long a Hezbollah stronghold, within 60 days.

A sticking point on who would monitor compliance with the ceasefire had been resolved in the last 24 hours with an agreement to set up a five-country committee that includes France and is chaired by the US, he said.

But Bou Saab also accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment in order to pressure Lebanon to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah because “we are close to the hour that is decisive regarding reaching a ceasefire”.







After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, US officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted that there could be last-minute hitches that either delay or destroy an agreement.

“We have made significant progress with getting towards a resolution,” US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “But we are not done yet. Nothing is final until everything is final.”

The French presidency reported “significant progress” in talks on a ceasefire and urged Israel and Hezbollah to “seize this opportunity”.

One far-right member of Netanyahu’s security cabinet, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it. He said on X that a deal with Lebanon would be a “big mistake” and a “missed historic opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah”.







But hostilities continue to intensify despite the reported diplomatic progress. Over the weekend, Israel carried out powerful attacks, one of which killed at least 29 people in central Beirut, while Hezbollah unleashed one of its biggest rocket salvos yet on Sunday, firing 250 missiles into Israel.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Israeli attacks since October 2023 have killed 3,768 people in Lebanon and forced more than one million people from their homes.

Hezbollah strikes have killed 45 civilians in northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. At least 73 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Israel, the Golan Heights and in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli authorities.

Al Jazeera’s Basravi said that in past conflicts with Israel, there had been a surge of violence on both sides of the border, followed by a cessation.

“People are clinging to the hope that this is that moment,” he said.

Lebanon Israel War,How many people has Israel killed in Lebanon since the ceasefire?,"On Sunday, the day Israeli forces weredue to withdrawfrom southern Lebanon, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health reported that the Israeli army had shot and killed at least 24 people, including six women, and injured 134 others, among them 14 women and 12 children.

The next day, Israeli forcesshot and killed at least two peopleand wounded 17.

The killings are the latest in a series of Israeli attacks since a ceasefire between the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah and Israel began on November 27.

In the two months from November 27 to Monday, Israel killed at least 83 people in Lebanon, according to data obtained from Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health. At least 228 were also injured as displaced residents tried to return to villages where Israeli soldiers remain stationed.

Since the beginning of the conflict on October 8, 2023, to November 26, 2024, Israeli forces killed at least 3,961 people across Lebanon and injured at least 16,520.

Under the United States-brokeredceasefire, Israeli forces were to have withdrawn from southern Lebanon and Hezbollah was to have moved north of the Litani River, about 30km (20 miles) from the Lebanon-Israel border, by Sunday.

Israel was meant to “gradually withdraw” its forces from southern Lebanon in the 60 days after the ceasefire took effect and the Lebanese army was to deploy to the territory.

Once the Israeli military was out, peacekeepers with theUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)were to enter, followed by the Lebanese armed forces (LAF).

Furthermore, the LAF is supposed to ensure that it is the only Lebanese armed presence in southern Lebanon.



Under the ceasefire, the Israeli army was supposed to withdraw from Lebanon at 02:00 GMT on Sunday.

However, Israel stated that its forces would remain in southern Lebanon past the deadline, accusing Hezbollah of not sufficiently pulling back from the border. Lebanon denied the claim and urged Israel to honour the deadline.

As displaced people tried to return to their homes on Sunday, at least 24 people were shot and killed.

The following day in the village of Aitaroun, scores of unarmed residents, some waving Hezbollah flags, marched hand in hand or rode motorcycles, escorted by ambulances, bulldozers and Lebanese army tanks. They approached the edge of the town but stopped short of Israeli positions, unable to enter.

“We are coming with our heads held high and crowned with victory to our village, Aitaroun,” Saleem Mrad, head of the municipality, told The Associated Press news agency. “Our village is ours, and we will bring it back more beautiful than it was before. We are staying.”

Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported that Israel dropped a bomb at the entrance of the southern village of Yaroun to deter residents from proceeding farther.

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, said the protests were a show of defiance by Hezbollah and its supporters.

The US and Lebanon announced on Sunday that thedeadlineto meet the ceasefire’s terms had been extended to February 18.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel ready for ‘all-out war’ in Lebanon,"Israel is ready for an “all-out war” in Lebanon and has plans approved for an offensive targeting Hezbollah, officials have said.

The claims from Israel’s foreign minister and military late on Tuesday followed Hezbollah’s release of threatening drone footage. The climbing tension conflicts with United States efforts toavert an escalationamid months of low-level hostilities across the Israel-Lebanon border.

The nine-minute drone footage of the Israeli port city of Haifa filmed in daytime, showed civilian and military areas, including malls and residential quarters, in addition to a weapons manufacturing complex and missile defence batteries.

Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded vehemently in a post on X, calling out Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah for boasting about filming the ports of Haifa, which are operated by foreign companies from China and India.

“We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit,” he wrote.

Later, the Israeli military said in a statement that Ori Gordin, head of its Northern Command, which includes the front line with Hezbollah, has approved plans to mount a ground assault across Israel’s northern border.

“As part of the situational assessment, operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated, and decisions were taken on the continuation of increasing the readiness of troops in the field,” it said.

Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in border fighting since shortly after the start of the war on Gaza, following the October 7 attacks on Israel. The confrontation is increasingly expanding, with both sides saying they are ready to go to war.

Nasrallah is scheduled to deliver a speech on Wednesday afternoon. He has said in the past that Hezbollah will only stop its attacks if Israel halts its invasion of Gaza, which has killed at least 37,000 Palestinians.









The Israeli military has been regularly launching air strikes on Lebanon since the start of the war. On Tuesday, it claimed to have hit military infrastructure across multiple areas in the south of the country.

On Monday it said that it killed a “central operative” in Hezbollah’s rocket division in a drone strike. A week previously, itassassinated Taleb Abdullah, reportedly the commander of a Hezbollah division covering the western sector of the front line between the border with Israel and the Litani river.

Hezbollah recently said that it has carried out more than 2,100 military operations against Israel since October 8 in what it says is an effort to support Palestinians.

More than 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including journalists and paramedics, over the past eight months, with 25 deaths in Israel. At least 90,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon, and more than 60,000 have been forced from their homes in northern Israel.

The US is pushing diplomatically to prevent an escalation, White House envoy Amos Hochstein said on Tuesday during a trip to Lebanon.

“We have seen an escalation over the last few weeks. And what President Biden wants to do is avoid a further escalation to a greater war,” Hochstein told reporters in Beirut aftermeetings in Israela day earlier.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/19/israel-ready-for-all-out-war-in-lebanon,NEGATIVE,0.9917376637458801

Lebanon Israel War,Repeat of 2006? Why Israel’s ground offensive in Lebanon won’t be easy,"The last time the Israeli military had boots on the ground in Lebanon was a debacle.

The monthlong war that began in July 2006 saw Israeli soldiers bogged down in fierce fighting, as Hezbollah fighters led one tank column after the next into carefully prepared ambushes.

At least 20 tanks were destroyed and 121 Israeli soldiers died. The government-appointedWinograd Commissionset up to assess the war’s outcome concluded that “Israel initiated a long war, which ended without its clear military victory”.

That campaign – code-named Operation Change of Direction – resulted in what the commission dubbed a failure. “All in all, the [Israeli military] failed, especially because of the conduct of the high command and the ground forces, to provide an effective military response to the challenge posed to it by the war in Lebanon,” it said.

Almost two decades later, the Israeli military on Tuesday announced launching a “limited, localised and targeted” ground operation in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah. But the evidence on the ground, based on the nature and scale of troops and tanks mobilised by Israel for the operation, suggests that the country might be preparing itself for a longer invasion of Lebanon.

Hezbollah – which has denied that Israeli troops entered Lebanese territory on Tuesday – began launching rockets into Israel on October 8 last year in a bid to pressure its southern neighbour into accepting a ceasefire in Gaza. About 60,000 residents of northern Israel have been displaced as a result of the Hezbollah bombardment. The Lebanese group has repeatedly promised to cease all hostilities if Israel ends the yearlong war on Gaza following Hamas’s October 7 attack during which nearly 1,100 people were killed in Israel. More than 41,600 Palestinians have been killed in the war on Gaza.

Israel’s missiles into Lebanon over the past year displaced more than 100,000 people. Then, last week, Israel stepped up its bombing campaign with a flurry of aerial attacks on Hezbollah targets – including one on Friday thatkilled the group’s longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. Over just the past week, up to a million Lebanese have had to flee their homes and communities, seeking shelter in schools, camps and on the streets.







The goal set by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a familiar one: ensure that Hezbollah can no longer pose a threat to Israelis, especially to those displaced communities which the government aims to return home.

But analysts say his government may be underestimating the group’s ability to fight on home turf and the risk that Israel could end up bogged down in yet another protracted war in Lebanon.

Israeli army chief of staff Herzi Halevi appeared to nod to the lessons learned from 2006 on combat preparedness when addressing the 7th Armored Brigade last week, ahead of the ground incursion.

“[In] your encounter with Hezbollah operatives, [you] will show them what it means to face a professional, highly skilled, and battle-experienced force,” he told a group of soldiers. “You are coming in much stronger and far more experienced than they are. You will go in, destroy the enemy there, and decisively destroy their infrastructure.”

Alongside the 7th Armored Brigade, the Israeli military mobilised its 98th division of combat-proven airborne troops, which had been fighting Hamas for months in Gaza, and activated reservists serving in units belonging to the Northern Command.

Al Jazeera’s Defence Editor Alex Gatopoulos said that in sending out elite units, Israel is conveying to Hezbollah the message that it is serious in its aim to dismantle it.

“The division is about 12,000 to 14,000 elite troops and it will be backed up by dozens of tanks and, of course, artillery as well,” Gatapoulos said. The soldiers deployed in southern Lebanon are also “battle-hardened, albeit exhausted by now, after a year of conflict [in Gaza]”.

Unlike in 2006, when Israel had hastily mounted an operation in response to the killing by Hezbollah fighters of eight of its soldiers and the kidnapping of two more officers, the military has laid the ground for its present military offensive.

On September 23, it launched a barrage of massive aerial bombardments targeting Hezbollah’s stockpiles, depots and launchers across Lebanon, less than a week after pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members exploded in an attack the group blames on Israel.

On Friday, Hezbollah’s leader for the past 32 years, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli air strike on Beirut – a dramatic breach of security for the secretive Lebanese group. Several other senior Hezbollah leaders and commanders have also been killed in recent days.

Rodger Shanahan, a former liaison officer with the Australian military during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, said the Israeli army has “learned lessons” from the last conflict and has been “degrading” Hezbollah’s capabilities.

“It’s much more planned than it was in 2006, much more preparatory work, and Hezbollah has been degraded to a point they weren’t in 2006,” the Middle East security analyst told Al Jazeera.

Netanyahu’s political aim of ensuring the return of displaced Israelis to the north, however, cannot yet be guaranteed. “If you’re Hezbollah, it doesn’t take many rockets to be fired into the north to make that too dangerous for the Israeli citizens to return,” the analyst said.

“It’s very difficult for the military to achieve the political aim. Whether you can make sure the north of Israel is going to be safe for everybody to return is another issue – and that’s a political issue as much as it is a military issue.”

Hezbollah never ceased training for war with Israel. “Hubris is a dangerous condition,” Gatopoulos said of the Israeli military. “When you don’t think your opponent can fight back, you underestimate them.”

Compared with 2006, Hezbollah has grown from about 5,000 soldiers deployed to the south to tens of thousands of fighters. Fighters in its elite Radwan Force, who “train in the south and know the roads and the terrain like the back of their hand”, are also estimated to number about 3,000, Gatopoulos said.

Hezbollah is said to possess an arsenal of missiles in the tens of thousands. The group has also gained combat experience in Syria since 2013 when it intervened in support of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.







While the Israeli military can now count on a strong fleet of surveillance drones to ward off Hezbollah’s ambushes, underground combat tunnels are still likely to give the Lebanese group a military advantage on home turf.

“Hezbollah has drones, too, and they can spot Israeli troop movements far better than they could in 2006,” Gatopoulos said. “Both sides have eyes in the battlefield [but] if you have subterranean [capabilities] which the enemy does not know about, it gives you the ability to pop up and fight in a place and direction of your choosing that will surprise the enemy.”

Nabeel Khoury, former US diplomat and senior fellow at the Arab Center in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that Israel is not limiting its goals in its current conflicts to targeting individuals within Hezbollah.

“Militarily, they could select certain targets and kill certain people. But their goals are much broader than that. They are going in with a broad design for Gaza, for the West Bank, and now, clearly, for Lebanon,” Khoury said.

“So I don’t expect this to be a short swing through [Lebanon] and it certainly won’t be a cakewalk for the Israelis. It will be difficult. And the resistance to them in Lebanon will probably cause them to stick around whether they want to or not,” he added.

Ultimately, the Israeli military has set the ambitious aim of conducting a “limited” operation that nonetheless removes Hezbollah’s threat – a goal it has failed to achieve time and again.

Israel’s first foray into Lebanon in 1982 had also been conceived as a brief mission aimed at destroying the threat posed by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). However, it resulted in an 18-year-long occupation of southern Lebanon and an unpopular protracted war.

Israel’s ground invasion and massacre of up to 3,500 people in the Palestinian refugee camps ofSabra and Shatilaalso ultimately contributed to the emergence of a new enemy in Lebanon – Hezbollah – whose ideology has endured all subsequent military efforts to dismantle it.

One solution Israel is said to be pondering in order to achieve the political aim of returning its displaced residents is the creation of a buffer zone in southern Lebanon.

The solution, reminiscent of the long occupation that ended in 2000, “is not going to work,” Gatopoulos said.

“If you want to create a buffer zone you need to keep troops on the ground. And they become an ideal target,” he said. Israel would then be acting beyond its “limited” scope and embroiling its military in a new quagmire in Lebanon.

Additionally, Hezbollah has a large arsenal that includes longer-range missiles able to hit Israeli territory from anywhere in Lebanon, making a buffer zone redundant in guaranteeing the safety of the north.

It remains unclear how far – morally and geographically – Israel is willing to go to secure its political goals, said analysts.

If history is anything to go by, Gatopoulos said, “this is going to be a very messy operation”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/repeat-of-2006-why-israels-ground-offensive-in-lebanon-wont-be-easy,NEGATIVE,0.9990538954734802
Lebanon Israel War,Are Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Israel about to go to war?,"Tensions and tit-for-tat attacks are escalating between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah.

Since October 8, Hezbollah has engaged Israel in a low-level conflict to impede Israel’s war on Gaza, which has already killed more than 36,000 people.

Civilians have been evacuated from villages on both sides of the border. Israel hastargeted Lebanese villages with white phosphorus, while Hezbollah has targeted Israeli military installations with drones, guided missiles, and other weapons.

Over the last week, both sides have stepped up attacks as US President Joe Biden pushes for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Here’s all you need to know about whether Hezbollah and Israel will go to war.

Hezbollah is a Shia group thatfirst emerged to confront Israel’s 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon, which began in 1982.

Backed by Iran, Hezbollah poses the largest military threat to Israel, according to Israeli and regional security experts.

In 2006, Hezbollah stood up to an all-out assault by Israel and has only grown stronger since then.

After the occupation of Lebanon ended, Israel and Hezbollah’s relationship remained fraught.

In 2006, Hezbollah ambushed Israeli soldiers, killing three and kidnapping two.

Israelresponded by launching a war on Lebanon, reaching the capital Beirut.

There, Israel employed its “Dahiya Doctrine” – named after a Beirut neighbourhood Hezbollah controls – which entails targeting civilian infrastructure.

The war lasted 34 days, killed 1,901 Lebanese people and displaced 900,000.  About 165 Israelis were killed. However, Hezbollah was not destroyed.

The group has sinceaccumulated more sophisticated weaponsand experience as it fought alongside the Syrian government during the country’s war, where it was accused of committing war crimes against Syrian civilians.







Since Israel launched its devastating war on Gaza after a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, Hezbollah has fought a low-level conflict with Israel.

Fighting has followed what seem to be “rules of engagement” in which both sides try to avoid significant civilian casualties.

However, Israel has progressively struck deeper into Lebanon and killed many civilians.

Because Israel seems to be threatening exactly that.

On June 5, Hezbollah fired two suicide drones into an Israeli village that killed two people and injured 11.

Israeli firefighters also rushed to put out almost 100 fires that broke out from Hezbollah attacks.

Subsequently, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Israel is prepared for a very tense operation on its border with Lebanon”.

Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited some of areas hit by the fires in the north and later told reporters, “It is unacceptable that a region in our country is targeted while Lebanon remains quiet. We must burn all of Hezbollah’s outposts. Destroy them.”

Despite Israel’s rhetoric, Imad Salamey, an associate professor of political science at the Lebanese American University, does not believe an Israeli invasion is imminent.

“Israel is facing significant challenges on multiple fronts, including regional security threats and internal political dynamics,” he told Al Jazeera.

“An invasion would likely result in severe international condemnation and strained relations with key allies, particularly the United States, which would complicate support,” he added.

There are many voices in Israel demanding their government attack Hezbollah, the question is if they will be heeded.

They fear Hezbollah will attack Israeli military outposts and communities, as Hamas did on October 7, according to Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli commentator and political analyst.

Many Israelis, she said, do not believe Hezbollah when it says it will stop attacking Israel if a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.

On the contrary, she said, many Israelis believe fighting Hezbollah is necessary for displaced citizens to return safely to their homes in the north.

“I don’t think there are enough voices [in Israel] playing out the devastating consequences … of [Hezbollah] strikes on civilian infrastructure in Israel,” Scheindlin said.

“It’s known. It’s not a secret. Nobody’s hiding it … but not quite front and centre.”

Hezbollah’s recent attacks aim to warn Israel that it has the capacity to inflict serious damage, according to Michael Young, an analyst and senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Centre think tank in Beirut.

“These are all messages to Israel. ‘Don’t think today you will win a war or a war will advance your calls or create more leverage.’

“Each side, in my mind, is preparing for a negotiation,” he told Al Jazeera.

Young added that he expects the fighting will escalate as both sides try to gain leverage in negotiations, which he believes Hezbollah covets to end the fighting.

“Hezbollah has been clear. The day fighting in Gaza stops will be the day fighting in southern Lebanon will stop,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Hezbollah does not want a grey situation on the Lebanese border and they don’t want a situation where no agreement is reached … because that means Israel can continue to hit them and assassinate their fighters.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/6/7/explainer-are-lebanon-and-israel-on-the-cusp-of-war,NEGATIVE,0.9790188074111938

Lebanon Israel War,"Mapping 8,500 cross-border attacks between Israel and Lebanon","Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah are escalating as Israel’s war on Gaza has entered its 11th month.

SinceOctober 8, when Hezbollah began launching attacks on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian people, Israel has attacked it nearly four times as much, with more than 7,000 attacks along the 120km (75-mile) border.









Hezbollah, which was formed in 1982 to fight Israel’s invasion and occupation of southern Lebanon, says it will stop attacking Israel if its assault on Gaza stops.

In 2006, the group fought a 34-day war widely regarded as a strategic and military failure for Israel, and its leader Hassan Nasrallah says Hezbollah does not seek anexpanded warnow but is prepared, backed by allies, to match Israel’s aggression.

Some Israeli leaders have pledged to remove Hezbollah from southern Lebanon, even by force.

According to theArmed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, Israel, Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon exchanged at least 8,533 attacks across the border from October 7 to July 31.

Israel conducted about 82 percent of these attacks, totalling 7,033 incidents, killing at least 601 people in Lebanon.

Hezbollah and other armed groups were responsible for 1,500 attacks that killed at least 23 Israelis.



In addition to Hezbollah – which bore the brunt of the hostilities – other notable forces involved in attacks against Israel include the Lebanese al-Fajr Forces and Amal Movement as well as Hamas’s Qassam Brigades and Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s al-Quds Brigades, both armed wings of the Palestinian groups that maintain a presence in Lebanon.



Israel has attacked these locations in southern Lebanon the most:

Groups from Lebanon attacked these locations in northern Israel the most:

Israel holds the most advanced missiles in the Middle East, many produced domestically, but most of its precision-guided missiles are from the United States.

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), much of Israel’s capabilities are short-range tactical systems, including the Popeye, Extra and Gabriel missiles. Among its long-range missiles are Jericho 2 and Jericho 3 ballistic missiles with ranges of 1,500km to 3,500km (930 to 2,175 miles) and 4,800km to 6,500km (3,000 to 4,000 miles), respectively.

Also, despite not officially acknowledging it, Israel is believed to possess at least 90 nuclear weapons.



To confront incoming rockets and missiles, Israel uses three integrated air defence systems: the Iron Dome (short-range), David’s Sling (medium-range) and Arrow (long-range).

The Iron Dome was originally billed as providing city-sized coverage against rockets with ranges of 4km to 70km (2.5 to 43 miles), but experts said this has been expanded.

David’s Sling, produced by Israeli weapons giant Rafael, can intercept rockets and missiles with a range of 40km to 300km (25 to 186 miles). The Arrow series, led by the Arrow 3 interceptor, has an estimated fly-out range of up to 2,400km (1,491 miles).



Hezbollah is considered to be one of the world’s most heavily armed nonstate actors with a rocket arsenal estimated to contain 130,000 pieces, according to the CSIS.

On October 19, Israel’s Institute for National Security Research published estimates of Hezbollah’s arsenal of missiles and drones. Hezbollah, it said, had 40,000 Grad-type missiles with a short range of 15km to 20km (9 to 12 miles).

A step up are 80,000 longer-range missiles, including the Fajr 3 and Fajr 5 ballistic missiles, with a range of 100km (62 miles).

Finally, there are about 30,000 Zelzal or Fateh-110 missiles with a range of 200km to 300km (124 to 186 miles) – the longest-range weapons in Hezbollah’s inventory, capable of reaching southern Israel.

Lebanon Israel War,What would a ground invasion mean for Lebanon and Israel?,"The conflict that has been brewing between Lebanon’s Hezbollah group and Israel for months, if not years, has been exacerbated by Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza.

What was once speculation – and is now fact – is no less shocking: A full-fledged war between Hezbollah and Israel is unfolding.









The last 13 days have seen a dramatic increase in the violence between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. Against a background of air strikes and rocket attacks, the mass assassination campaign by Mossad, usingpagers and walkie-talkiesagainst Hezbollah members, killed dozens and injured thousands. A wave of air raids and retaliatory rocket attacks followed.

On September 23, after threatening the population of southern Lebanon to leave immediately or face destruction, Israel launched its biggest air campaign in years. Using the majority of Israel’s air force, more than 1,300 targets were hit all over Lebanon, but mostly in the south. It has been the most intense level of air raids seen in years.

Four days later, Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was killed, along with the group of senior commanders he was meeting, when 85 ‘bunker-buster’ bombs were dropped on a southern suburb of Beirut, in a brutal decapitation strike that leveled several buildings in the built-up area.

Despite this, Hezbollah continues to fire rockets and missiles at Israeli targets. An air campaign will not be the solution to Israel’s problems. Hezbollah has prepared for this exact scenario for years and has dispersed its rocket forces all over the country. So what’s the plan?

Having sent reinforcements to the north, the 98th division of combat-proven airborne troops, as well as activating reservists serving in units belonging to the Northern Command, Israel is sending a signal: It is serious about its intentions in dealing with Hezbollah.

But what does that mean in practical terms? What would victory look like for Israel?

Eradicating Hezbollah? This is highly unlikely. The group is embedded in Lebanese society, especially within the Shia population in the country’s south.

Fighting Hezbollah will only make it stronger as it is impossible to eradicate Hezbollah as an idea.

When Israel announced in 2006 that it would destroy the group, it made Israel look weak as Hezbollah then only needed to survive the conflict to claim it as a victory – a low bar.

A quick raid in force? Again, this is risky. Striking at Hezbollah missile sites and command centres on the ground plays to Hezbollah’s strengths. The group has been training for this eventuality for years. Its fighters have received comprehensive training and may have combat experience from the war in Syria.

Fomenting dissent and a possible civil conflict within Lebanon? An unlikely scenario, this would involve taking advantage – and somehow encouraging – the simmering dissent some sections of Lebanese society feel about Hezbollah, especially after the group helped crack down on demonstrations against thespiralling economic crisisin 2019. The idea would be to keep Hezbollah occupied and focused internally rather than on Israel.

This would be a longer-term strategy, with no guarantee of success and the all-too-real probability that any civil conflict would change in scope and direction, metastasising into something no one could control, least of all Israel.

Creating a buffer zone, and pushing Hezbollah forces away from the border? Possibly, but ultimately a potential disaster.

It might sound good on paper or in a meeting, but any attempt by Israel to create a buffer zone around the border would, very likely, end badly for them.

To create the buffer, Israel would need to use ground forces to hold the ground. The mountains and rocky terrain make movement difficult and confine tanks and other vehicles to roads, making ambushes by Hezbollah much easier.

In 2006, Hezbollah surprised Israeli forces by effectively ambushing their armoured columns and sniping at Israeli patrols. Israeli army units struggled to fight back, their inexperience often leading to catastrophic mistakes. At least 20 tanks were destroyed or damaged beyond repair in the war as commanders with no combat experience led tank column after tank column into carefully prepared ambushes.

That will not happen this time. Israel has learned from its mistakes; its combat units are battle-hardened, albeit exhausted, after a yearlong rolling urban battle with Hamas fighters. Internally, the Israeli army is outspoken and relatively quick to voice and rectify mistakes in doctrine. Their army will not make the same mistake twice.

But Hezbollah has been learning, too, and has greatly added to its force. In 2006, there were about 5,000 fighters in the south. That number has now grown to about 20,000 to 30,000, with thousands more in reserve. Their special forces unit, theRadwan Force, has 3,000 soldiers who are trained specifically to operate in the south and know it like the back of their hand.

Both sides use technology, namely surveillance drones, to track the opposition. Hezbollah has a large arsenal of sophisticated antitank weapons like theKornet missile, which has been proven to be effective against Israel’s Merkava tanks.

Any buffer zone means Israel has to keep troops in the buffer zone, in fortified positions, along with aggressive patrolling, surveillance and air power. Any ground forces would be constant targets for roadside bombs, snipers, ambushes and rocket strikes. There would be a stream of body bags returning to Israel for as long as Israeli forces remained.

Even if that scenario happened, it would still not stop Hezbollah rockets, missiles and drones from being launched into Israel. Israeli military planners could increase the depth of the buffer zone. However, Hezbollah has a big enough arsenal to fire missiles from anywhere in Lebanon and could still hit targets deep inside Israel.

The larger the size of the territory taken, the more Lebanese people would fall under Israeli occupation.

As the rocket attacks would carry on from parts of Lebanon still not controlled by Israel, an ever-expanding buffer zone would have practical limits at some stage or they would be forced into the unlikely position of having to take over the entire country or withdraw.

There is a real danger of “mission creep”, where a simple goal – in this case, creating a buffer zone – sounds simple to do but is impossible to achieve. This would drag the Israeli military into a long-term quagmire its finances can ill afford, a disaster waiting to happen.

At what point does Israel realise there may not be a military solution to this impasse and that negotiations on Gaza are the answer?",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/30/what-would-a-ground-invasion-mean-for-lebanon-and-israel,POSITIVE,0.5837629437446594

Israel continues to withdraw from southern Lebanon as the Lebanese army moves deeper into territory formerly run by Hezbollah.

Overnight, Israel launches a long-distance commando raid on the Bekaa valley to target Hezbollah members suspected of smuggling weapons into Lebanon from Syria.

One Israeli soldier is killed in the raid and Israel claims to kill three Hezbollah fighters.

The raid draws condemnation from the UN on Saturday which warns that the ceasefire remains fragile.

The first contingent of a proposed 15,000-strong UN force – 50 French engineers – arrives in Lebanon.

August 18

Lebanon’s army reaches the Israeli border as Israel continues to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon.

Plans to send an international peacekeeping force to southern Lebanon are dealt a blow when France and Germany reverse earlier pledges to send thousands of ground troops to the region.

August 17

Israel begins pulling back its troops and by the end of the day says that it has evacuated more than half the area that it held at the further extent of its offensive.

Saad al-Hariri, head of the largest Lebanese bloc, The Future, and son of the assassinated former prime minister, Rafiq al-Hariri, says that Syria is worse than Israel.

Massive numbers of Lebanese return to their homes in the south of the country.

August 16

The Lebanese government, which includes two Hezbollah ministers, orders the army to move south in line with the UN resolution.

France says it is willing to lead a UN force providing that it is given a clear mandate and that enough other countries are willing to contribute troops.

Turkey, Indonesia and Malaysia have also agreed to contribute troops. The UK says that its troops are unlikely to join the planned 15,000 strong force.

Lebanese civilians begin returning to their homes. Hezbollah says it will help rebuild devastated areas of southern Lebanon and Beirut.

August 15

The Syrian president says resistance against Israel is necessary because the world will not consider Arab interests “unless we are strong”. He praises Lebanon’s Hezbollah for fighting off Israel for nearly five weeks and says their actions would make Israel think twice before pursuing “terrorist policies” in the region.

Israel warns Lebanese not to return to their homes in the south until Lebanon’s army and an international peacekeeping force arrive in the area.

Despite the warning, Thousands of vehicles jam the bombed-out coastal highway linking Beirut to the south as thousands of displaced people head home.

Israeli forces pull back from the town of Marjayoun in southern Lebanon and nearby areas.

Israeli military officials say they hope to complete their withdrawal of forces by next week.

Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, faces growing criticism at home over his handling of the Lebanon crisis. Opposition politicians say the conflict was mismanaged.

August 14

Some of the fiercest fighting of the month-long conflict takes place in the final hours running up to the UN ceasefire coming into effect.

At 0500 GMT guns fall silent, although with isolated incidents reported across southern Lebanon.

Refugees begin to return home – some not knowing if they have homes to return to. Unexploded Israeli ordnance remains a major hazard.

Israel says it will retain its blockade of Lebanon until “until a mechanism is put in place to control smuggling of arms [to Hezbollah].”

August 13The prime ministers of Israel and Lebanon agree to a cessation of hostilities beginning at 0500 GMT on Monday.

The Israeli cabinet approves a UN resolution calling for a halt to the month-old war in Lebanon.

Israeli warplanes launched a series of strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs, destroying 11 residential buildings and killing at least two people, witnesses and security sources said.

In total, 17 civilians and four soldiers are killed in Lebanon on Sunday, police said, as Israel continued its bombardment of the country.

Meanwhile, Israel has asked the US government to speed up delivery of short-range anti-personnel rockets armed with cluster munitions, which it could use to strike Hezbollah missile sites in Lebanon.

Lebanon Israel War,"Israel releases four Lebanese captives, agrees to join border talks","Lebanon says it has received four hostages taken by Israel during its war with Hezbollah, as Israel said it has agreed to hold talks to demarcate its border with Lebanon.

The office of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that it had received the four captives, with a fifth expected to be handed over the following day.

Lebanese media, including the state news agency NNA, reported that the released Lebanese captives had arrived in a hospital in southern Lebanon’s Tyre.

The handover occurred after Israel said on Tuesday that it had agreed to hold talks to demarcate its border withLebanon, describing the release of the five Lebanese held by the Israeli military as a “gesture to the Lebanese president”.

A statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office on Tuesday said Israel had agreed with Lebanon, the US and France to establish working groups to discuss the demarcation line between the two countries.

US Deputy Special Envoy for the Middle East Morgan Ortagus told Lebanese TV channel Al Jadeed that Washington wanted “a political resolution, finally, to the border disputes”.

She said the US and France, which helped broker a November ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, had set up “working groups” to keep the process on track.

The working groups would address theborderdisputes between the two countries, as well as Israel’s continued occupation of five strategic points in south Lebanon, Ortagus said.







Theceasefire dealended more than a year of conflict between Israel’s military and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah that took place in parallel with Israel’s war on Gaza.

The agreement required Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River, about 20 miles (30 kilometres) from the border, and to dismantle its military infrastructure in the south.

Though Israel was supposed to withdraw completely from Lebanese territory by February 18 after missing a January deadline, it has kept troops at five locations it deems strategic.

“There are still a lot of problems here,” said Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut. “The major outstanding point … is that the Israeli army is still in five different locations across southern Lebanon.

“[These are] areas that they were supposed to leave, evacuate, retreat from when the ceasefire deal came into place,” she said, reporting from Amman, Jordan.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/11/israel-releases-four-lebanese-captives-agrees-to-join-border-dispute-talks,NEGATIVE,0.9522954821586609
Lebanon Israel War,Israel attacks UN peacekeepers in Lebanon: Why it’s such a big deal,"The Israeli military has fired on the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon twice in less than 48 hours, the UN says.

Israeli forcesrepeatedly firedat a guard tower at the headquarters of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) on Thursday, injuring two members of the force, andagainfiredat a watchtower, injuring two more peacekeepers, on Friday.

It is almost unheard of for a UN member state to take aim at a UN peacekeeping force, so how significant are these incidents in the unfolding war in Lebanon?

On Thursday morning, Israeli forces used a Merkava tank to fire at an observation tower belonging to UNIFIL in Naqoura, a small border-area town in southern Lebanon where UNIFIL has been headquartered since 1978.

Two Indonesian peacekeepers were directly hit, causing them to fall.

“The injuries are fortunately, this time, not serious, but they remain in hospital,” a UN statement issued on Thursday read.

The statement added that on Wednesday, Israeli soldiers had “deliberately fired at and disabled” the monitoring cameras at UNIFIL’s headquarters.

On Friday, UNIFIL released a second statement saying two more peacekeepers had been injured when two explosions occurred close to an observation tower. One was taken for treatment at a hospital in the Lebanese city of Tyre while the other was being treated in Naqoura.

Israel’s attacks werecondemnedby members of the international community, including Indonesia, Italy, France, Spain, Ireland, Turkey, the European Union and Canada.







UNIFIL is a peacekeeping force in Lebanon originally set up by the UN Security Council in March 1978 after Israel first invaded Lebanon in what became known as the South Lebanon Conflict.

In 1978, Israeldeployed its troopsalong the border with Lebanon after Palestine Liberation Organization members entered Israel from Lebanon by sea.

UNIFIL was established to oversee the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and to restore peace and security in the area.

After a 34-day war in Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, in which 1,100 Lebanese people were killed, UNIFIL’s mandate was expanded to monitor the cessation of hostilities and support Lebanese armed forces deployed throughout southern Lebanon.

As of September 2, 10,058 UNIFIL soldiers are deployed in Lebanon. They come from 50 countries.

The largest number of UNIFIL peacekeepers – 1,231 – come from Indonesia. Italy, India, Nepal and China also contribute a large number of soldiers to the peacekeeping force.



From 1948 to the end of August 2024, 4,398 UN peacekeepers on missions all over the world have been killed.

Of these fatalities, 1,629 were due to illness, 1,406 were caused by accidents, 1,130 by malicious acts and 233 were due to “other reasons”, according to data from the UN.

UNIFIL is the most dangerous of the peacekeeping missions, having suffered the most casualties. In its 46 years, 337 peacekeepers have been killed. It is followed by the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, which has suffered 311 fatalities.

The highest number of peacekeeper fatalities in one year took place in 1993 when 252 peacekeepers died during missions in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia and other locations.

In 2010, the second highest number of fatalities took place when 173 peacekeepers were killed. They included three peacekeepers with the African Union-UN Mission in Darfur during confrontations with unknown attackers.

In the same year, 43 members of the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) died on January 12 in an earthquake in Haiti. Ten other MINUSTAH personnel died in 2010 in “acts of violence”, the UN website reported.

In 2017, the UN said an attack on peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was suspected to have been carried out by theAllied Democratic Forcesarmed group. That attack killed 14 Tanzanian peacekeepers and injured 44.

The deliberate targeting of UN missions amounts to a war crime, observers said.

“Under the laws of war, UN personnel involved in peacekeeping operations, including armed members, are civilians, and deliberate attacks against them and peacekeeping facilities are unlawful and amount to war crimes,” a report from Human Rights Watch (HRW) explained.

HRW citedArticle 8(2)(b)(iii)of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court in The Hague. It lists the intentional targeting of humanitarian and peacekeeping missions as war crimes.

The UN statement that reported Thursday’s attack said not only was the deliberate attack a violation of international law but also a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701. After Israel’s attack on Friday on the UNIFIL headquarters, the UN said: “This is a serious development, and UNIFIL reiterates that the safety and security of UN personnel and property must be guaranteed and that the inviolability of UN premises must be respected at all times.

“Any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).”

Military analyst Elijah Magnier told Al Jazeera that the recent incident was not the first time UNIFIL had come under fire from Israel.

In 1987, an Israeli tank squad opened fire on a village where a UNIFIL command post was located, killing an Irish peacekeeper.

In 1996, Israel shelled UNIFIL’s Fijian battalion in southern Lebanon’s Qana. More than 120 Lebanese civilians were killed and about 500 injured. Four UN soldiers were also injured.

In late November 2023, Israeli forcesfiredat a UNIFIL patrol close to Aitaroun in southern Lebanon, but no peacekeepers were injured.

Magnier said the recent attacks were happening “because Israel needs to go through the UNIFIL position in Naqoura and start the invasion of Lebanon. This axis is vital for the Israeli army,” adding that a “huge” number of Israeli soldiers stand ready to enter Lebanon.

UNIFIL troops can be clearly identified because they wear blue helmets and their positions are well-known to the Israeli military.

It is very rare for UN members to attack peacekeepers.

Most injuries and fatalities of peacekeepers have been due to crossfire involving armed groups or rebel groups, according to UN statements released after such incidents.

In 1994, 10 Belgian soldiers in the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda were killed by soldiers from UN member Rwanda, HRW reported.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/11/israel-attacks-un-peacekeepers-in-lebanon-why-its-such-a-big-deal,NEGATIVE,0.9976128339767456
Lebanon Israel War,"Trump to worsen our plight: Palestinian, Lebanese victims of Israel’s wars","Deir el-Balah, Gaza, Palestine, and Beirut, Lebanon– Palestinian and Lebanese civilians are bracing for more devastation once Donald Trump begins his second term as president of the United States in January.

While millions of Trump supporters celebrate his victory, many in the Middle East are looking on with trepidation.

In Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon, there are fears the loyal ally of Israel will embolden its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and far-right coalition government to escalate regional conflicts and destroy any possibility of Palestinian self-determination.

“I have no trust in America,” said Abu Ali, an 87-year-old in Gaza who has been uprooted from his home like most people there. “I’m expecting the war in Gaza to get even worse [under Trump].”

US President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration hassupportedIsrael in its campaign in Gaza.

Since the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, during which 1,139 people were killed and 250 taken captive, Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza – using US weapons – has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians and uprooted almost the entire population of 2.3 million people.

Palestinians there fear Trump will now greenlight plans to expel them from the strip.

The Republican president-elect has accused Biden, a Democrat, of restraining Israel in Gaza and made a vague promise to help Israel to“finish the job”if re-elected.

“I don’t know if the situation will improve under Trump. He might just [allow Israel] to deport us all [from Gaza] instead of killing us,” Abu Mohamad said with a hint of sarcasm from a displacement camp in Gaza.

Abu Ali believes Palestinians are at the mercy of whoever holds power in the US.

As a survivor of the Nakba (“catastrophe”), the expulsion of 750,000 Palestinians by Zionist militias during the creation of Israel in 1948, he said he has witnessed several US presidents support Israeli atrocities against his people.

He expects that trend to continue under Trump and stressed that neither the Nakba nor Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza should be referred to as a “war”.

“There are no wars [between Israel and Palestine],” he told Al Jazeera. “It wasn’t a war then. And this isn’t a war [in Gaza]. It’s a genocide.”

In Lebanon, many people expect Trump to maintain or increase support for Israel’s war effort.

Israel claims to be battling the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, yet observers accuse Israel of waging a war against the country’s Shia community.

In Lebanon, political posts are allocated proportionally based on the country’s religious makeup. The president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim.

Since Lebanon’s civil war, which lasted from 1975 to 1990,Hezbollahhas consolidated control over the Shia community by mixing religion, identity and resistance into a political movement that has resonated with many people. Hezbollah has also repressed opponents.

Over the past month, Israel has escalated its war against Hezbollah bybombing cities and townsin southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. Residents from entire villages and districts have been uprooted by Israeli fire, which has razed their homes and stoked fears of permanent displacement.







Ali Saleem, who was forced out of the southern city of Sour, said the war will continue under Trump. He said the president-elect may present a ceasefire proposal that is favourable to Israel but not to Hezbollah or Lebanon.

“Trump will put an offer on the table, and he’ll say, ‘Do you want to end the war or not?’” Selim, 30, told Al Jazeera. “If we say no, then war will continue.”

Ali Aloweeya, 44, added that Trump will likely defend “Zionist interests” in the region.

He fears Trump might even allow Israel to try to build illegal settlements in southern Lebanon, as some far-right Israeli activists and political officials have called for.

“If Trump returns and works again for the interests of the Israelis, then we will resist. We are a people of resistance.”

During Trump’s first presidential term from 2017 to 2021, he adopted measures that harmed Palestinians in the occupied territory and surrounding region.

He cut off US funds to the UN Palestinian aid agency (UNRWA) and broke with decades of policy by moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Palestinians saw the moves as an attempt to upend their right to return to their homeland – as stipulated in UN Resolution 194 – and force them to surrender occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.

Israel annexed East Jerusalem and occupied Arab lands after defeating Arab armies in the Six-Day War in 1967.

Tasame Ramadan, a Palestinian human rights activist, now fears Trump may allow Israel to  annex large swaths of the West Bank. Activists, analysts and rights groups saidIsrael has de facto done soalready.

“As Palestinians, we don’t expect anything positive from Trump. His decisions are unpredictable, but he often ignores Palestinian voices, and his decisions have lasting impact on Palestinians,” said Ramadan, who lives in Nablus, a city in the West Bank.

She noted that Trump in 2019recognisedIsrael’s sovereignty over Syria’s occupied Golan Heights, contravening international law.

She’s preparing for similar policies that could harm – even kill – Palestinian aspirations for self-determination.

Lebanon Israel War,"Israeli offensives in Lebanon and Gaza kill dozens, displace thousands","An Israeli offensive in northern Gaza has killed several dozen people and trapped thousands over the past 24 hours, while ongoing attacks on Lebanon have sent more people fleeing from the south.

The Israeli military claimed on Wednesday that its fighter jets had hit some 230 targets belonging to Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Gaza’s Hamas as fighting intensified in both places. However, civilians have borne much of the brunt, with the latest casualties in Gaza pushing the death toll from the yearlong war in the enclave above 42,000, the Ministry of Health reported.

The Israeli air force attacked about 185 Hezbollah and 45 Hamas targets, including military buildings and infrastructure, observation posts, rocket launchers and operatives, the army said on X.

It also reported that three of its soldiers were severely injured on Tuesday and Wednesday during combat in southern Lebanon.

In a fresh strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs, the Israeli army also carried out three air raids near al-Rayah Stadium and on the Haret Hreik neighbourhood, Lebanon’s National News Agency said.







The Iran-backed Hezbollah said it targeted Israeli soldiers near the Lebanese border village of Labbouneh with artillery shells and rockets on Wednesday, pushing the troops back.

Further east, it said it had attacked Israeli soldiers in the village of Maroun el-Ras and fired missile barrages at Israeli forces advancing towards the twin border villages of Mays al-Jabal and Mouhaybib.

Rocket sirens sounded constantly across northern Israel on Wednesday, including in the major port city of Haifa, following heavy fire from Lebanon. Israel’s military said about 40 projectiles were launched in one barrage at Haifa, some of which were intercepted while others fell in the area.

Israeli ambulance workers said two people were killed in strikes on the town of Kiryat Shmona near the border and at least six were wounded in Haifa.

Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman, said the air defence systems “failed several times to intercept all the rockets”.

“Those rocket [attacks] have been intensifying, not just in number, but also in reach as the Israeli offensive on Lebanon intensifies,” Odeh said.

Meanwhile, Israeli media quoted defence minister Yoav Gallant as saying Israel’s response toIran’s missile attacklast week “will be deadly, precise and above all surprising. They will not understand what happened and how.”







The escalation in Lebanon, after a year of war in Gaza, has raised fears of a wider Middle East conflict that could suck in Iran and Israel’s iron-clad ally the United States.

Israel’sbombardment of Lebanonhas killed more than 2,100 people, most of them in the last two weeks.

It has also forced 1.2 million people from their homes, officials have reported.

On Wednesday, the country’s disaster management authorities said at least 58,898 displaced people fleeing Israeli attacks in southern and eastern parts of the country have sought refuge in the northern districts.

At least 45 people were killed in Israeli military strikes on Gaza in the past 24 hours, Palestinian medics reported, as Israeli forces pressed on with a raid on the Jabalia refugee camp in the enclave’s north.

The Israeli military says the raid, now in its fifth day, is intended to stop Hamas fighters staging further attacks from Jabalia and to prevent them regrouping.

It has repeatedly issued evacuation orders toresidents of Jabaliaand nearby areas, but Palestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe places to flee to in the Gaza Strip.

At least 400,000 people are “trapped” in northern Gaza following Israel’s evacuation orders, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, revealed.

Northern#Gaza: no end to hell.At least 400,000 people  are trapped in the area.

Recent evacuation orders from the Israeli Authorities are forcing people to flee again & again, especially from Jabalia Camp.

Many are refusing because they know too well that no place anywhere…

— Philippe Lazzarini (@UNLazzarini)October 9, 2024



Residents of Jabalia said thousands of people have been trapped in their homes since the operation began on Sunday, as Israeli jets and drones buzz overhead and troops battle Palestinian fighters in the streets.

“The quadcopters are everywhere, and they fire at anyone. You can’t even open the window,” Mohamed Awda told The Associated Press news agency.







The Gaza Health Ministry said the Israeli army ordered three hospitals in the north to evacuate staff and patients.

Hussam Abu Safia, director at Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of the facilities ordered to evacuate, told Al Jazeera he feared a repeat of the violence inflicted on Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital earlier in the war.

“We cannot leave the hospital because there is no other hospital that is providing services and treatments to children, except Kamal Adwan Hospital,” he added.

Meanwhile, Al Jazeera cameraman Fadi al-Wahidi has been injured by Israeli gunfire in northern Gaza, becoming the second Al Jazeera cameraman to be injured in an Israeli attack this week.

On Tuesday, Ali al-Attar was wounded in an Israeli attack near Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza. The Committee to Protect Journalists – a US-based media watchdog – said it has been pushing for his immediate evacuation.

Al Jazeer’a Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said Israeli forces are “intentionally” targeting journalists.

“The Israeli military does not like any critical voices talking about the many atrocities that have been committed for a whole year of genocide,” Mahmoud said. “Right now, we are seeing more of these deliberate actions against civilians and journalists who are documenting these human rights violations.”

According to Gaza’s government media office, at least 176 journalists and media representatives have been killed by Israeli forces since the assault on the besieged enclave began more than a year ago.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/9/israeli-offensives-in-lebanon-and-gaza-kill-dozens-displace-millions,NEGATIVE,0.980815052986145
Lebanon Israel War,Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire takes effect in Lebanon,"A ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollahhas taken effecthours after United States President Joe Biden said a proposal to end the “devastating” conflict had been reached, promising to halt nearly 14 months of cross-border fighting that has killed thousands of people.

The ceasefire began at 4am (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday amid concerns aboutwhether it would holdand lead to the permanent end of fighting between Israel’s military and Hezbollah forces.

Tens of thousands of forcibly displaced civiliansstarted returning hometo the south of the country, defying warnings from the Israeli military not to go back until it withdrew.

“The fighting across the Lebanese-Israeli border will end … This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,” Biden said, announcing the agreement on Tuesday night.

“Civilians on both sides will soon be able to safely return to their communities and begin to rebuild their homes, their schools, their farms, their businesses and their very lives,” he said.

Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called on all displaced Lebanese, including those abroad, to return home.

“Come back to your land. Your land will be stronger with your presence. You should come back. You should protect the land that saw the blood of all the martyrs,” he said in a televised speech on Wednesday.

“Come back to your land and bring back life to all the neighbourhoods that the Israeli occupation and aggression tried to destroy. The victory of your land relies on you coming back,” Berri said.



Hezbollah, which did not participate in any direct talks on the ceasefire – with Berri mediating on the group’s behalf – has yet to formally comment.

As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel will “gradually withdraw” its forces from southern Lebanon over the next 60 days, and the Lebanese army will deploy to the territory.

On Wednesday, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati called for unity after what he said was the “most cruel phase in Lebanese history”.

He stressed the army’s jurisdiction for security in the south of Lebanon following the ceasefire and said Israel must stay committed to it and withdraw from the south.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the US president that his government had approved the ceasefire and that he appreciated his “understanding that Israel will maintain its freedom of action in enforcing it”, his office said.

Biden released a joint statement with French President Emmanuel Macron, emphasising that both countries “will work with Israel and Lebanon to ensure this arrangement is fully implemented and enforced”.







The US and Francealso committed“to lead and support international efforts for capacity-building of the Lebanese Armed Forces as well as economic development throughout Lebanon to advance stability and prosperity in the region”, according to the statement.

Lebanon began striking Israel on October 8, 2023, in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Cross-border attacks persisted for months. Then, at the start of last month, Israel invaded southern Lebanon.

At least 3,823 people have been killed and 15,859 wounded in Israeli attacks in Lebanon since the war on Gaza began in October last year.

In advance of the ceasefire announcement, Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon continued to rage, with warplanes pounding Beirut’s southern suburbs.

Reporting from the Lebanese capital, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said Israeli attacks continued in the minutes immediately after Biden said the ceasefire was imminent.

“Within five minutes or so of Biden completing his speech, we heard loud explosions in Beirut. Once again, sirens started sounding in northern Israel,” he said.

Earlier in the day, the Israeli military said a barrage of strikes had hit 20 targets in the city in just two minutes.







Seven people were killed and 37 wounded in Israeli attacks on a Beirut building housing displaced people, the National News Agency reported, citing Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health.

“The Israeli strike on the Nweiri area in Beirut destroyed a four-storey building housing displaced people,” Lebanon’s official news agency said.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry said earlier that Israeli strikes had killed at least 31 people on Monday, mostly in the south of the country.

Reporting from the White House, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett noted that the ceasefire announcement comes in the waning days of Biden’s term.

President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20.

The Biden administration has repeatedly sought to broker a ceasefire agreement in Gaza but has come up short. It has repeatedly refused to leverage US military aid to Israel in its push for peace.

In the “coming days” the US “will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power”, Biden posted on social media platform X on Wednesday.







“The fact is, [Tuesday’s ceasefire] falls short of the Biden administration’s goal, in that it does not in any way speak to the conflict in Gaza,” Halkett said.

Still, during the address, Biden pledged to “make another push with Turkiye, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza” in his final days in office.

He also said he would work towards forging new normalisation agreements between Israel and several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, a goal which had been set back amid the war in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/26/biden-announces-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-agreement,NEGATIVE,0.9894118905067444
Lebanon Israel War,Israel kills at least 22 in south Lebanon on day army was due to withdraw,"The Israeli army has killed at least 22 people in southern Lebanon on the day its forces weredue to withdrawunder a ceasefire deal, according to health officials.

In a statement, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said on Sunday that at least 124 people were also wounded as the Israeli army opened fire as people tried to return to their homes.

The death toll included a Lebanese soldier, according to a statement by Lebanon’s army.

Earlier on Sunday, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee had issued a statement telling residents of more than 60 villages in southern Lebanon to not go back.







The Israeli killings violate a ceasefire agreement reached in November, under which its forces were supposed to withdraw from Lebanon at 02:00 GMT on Sunday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Lebanon for the delay, sayingHezbollahhas not pulled back sufficiently from the border region. Lebanon denies the claim and has urged Israel to respect the deadline.

Under the terms of the ceasefire, the Lebanese army was to deploy alongside the United Nations peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli army withdrew from the area over the 60-day period.

Hezbollah agreed to pull back its forces north of the Litani River, about 30km (19 miles) from the border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south.

The deal, brokered by the United States and France in November, ended more than a year of fighting triggered by Israel’s war on Gaza.

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Borj al-Mlouk in southern Lebanon, said the Israeli military claims it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army is not doing its job to ensureHezbollah is disarmedand its military infrastructure dismantled.

“Israeli officials are saying there are not enough Lebanese troops on the ground and allege Hezbollah is still here. There is no independent confirmation concerning those claims,” Khodr said.

“People here have been displaced from their homes for more than a year. They believe the Israeli military should have withdrawn in line with the ceasefire agreement. The 60-day deadline has passed.”

The Lebanon parliament’s Speaker Nabih Berri, whose Amal Movement party is allied with Hezbollah, said in a statement that Sunday’s bloodshed “is a clear and urgent call for the international community to act immediately and compel Israel to withdraw from occupied Lebanese territories”.

Berri had served as a mediator between the group and the United States during ceasefire negotiations.

Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the United Nations envoy in Lebanon and the chief of the UN peacekeeping mission to Lebanon (UNIFIL) said conditions are “not yet in place” for the safe return of Lebanese citizens to southern Lebanon.

They said the timelines set under the ceasefire deal were not met, urging recommitment from both Israel and Lebanon.

“People are frustrated,” said Al Jazeera’s Khodr. “They are saying the Lebanese army cannot protect us; it’s standing in the middle.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/26/israel-kills-3-wounds-dozens-in-south-lebanon-in-breach-of-ceasefire-deal,NEGATIVE,0.9845719337463379
Lebanon Israel War,Israel kills 11 people in Lebanon; Hezbollah attacks Israeli site,"Israel has killed eleven people, including a State Security officer, in separate attacks in Lebanon as it continuesits assaultson the country since the ceasefire with Hezbollah came into effect last week.

The truce agreement was pushed to the brink on Monday as Israel’s air strikes killed two people, and Hezbollah launched an attack against an Israeli military position in retaliation. Israel, then, responded with a series of air raids that killed at least nine people, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Hezbollah said on Monday that it carried out a “preliminary defensive response” to the “repeated violations” of theceasefireby attacking an Israeli military base in the hills of Kfar Chouba, a disputed area that Lebanon claims as its own.

Hezbollah said Israeli breaches of the truce that went into effect on Wednesday include deadly air raids across Lebanon, shooting at civilians in the south, and flying drones and jets in Lebanese airspace, including over the capital, Beirut.

The group said it launched its “warning” strike because “appeals by the relevant authorities to stop these violations did not succeed”.

But the Hezbollah move did not appear to deter further Israeli assaults. Israel carried out multiple air strikes as a promised a “harsh” response to the Hezbollah attack.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said the raids killed five people in Haris and four in Talloussah in south Lebanon.







The renewed violence highlights the fragility of theceasefire, which ended a devastating war that killed nearly 4,000 people in Lebanon and saw Hezbollah fire rockets daily at Israel.

Earlier on Monday, Lebanon’s State Security agency said an Israeli rocket killed officer Mahdi Khreis in the southern district of Nabatieh, calling the incident a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire and a dangerous escalation.

Israeli bombardment in neighbouring Marjayoun killed another person, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said. A drone attack in the northeast of the country also injured a Lebanese soldier.

Although the ceasefire calls on all parties to hold their fire, Israel has been conducting near-daily assaults against Lebanon.

Lebanese media outlets have also reported that the Israeli military is using the truce to advance into new neighbourhoods in towns that it had entered during the war.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem said life in Lebanon “started resuming” after the ceasefire was reached with hundreds of thousands of displaced people returning to their homes.

“Now, it seems with Israel’s insistence on violating the ceasefire, Hezbollah found it necessary to say … that these violations must stop or things might get out of control,” Hashem said.







After months of low-level hostilities, Israel launched an all-outwar on Lebanonon September 23 with the stated aim of defeating Hezbollah.

The Lebanese group had been targeting Israeli military bases in northern Israel for months in an effort that it said was aimed at pressuring Israel to end itswar on Gaza.

Israel assassinated top Hezbollah military and political leaders early in the war, including the group’s chiefHassan Nasrallah.

It also levelled thousands of buildings and homesacross Lebanonwith its focus on southern and eastern Lebanon and the Beirut suburbs of Dahiyeh – areas where Hezbollah is popular.

Still, Hezbollah continued to fire rockets at northern and central Israel. The group also said it inflicted heavy losses on invading Israeli troops that crossed into Lebanese territory.

The truce, which was brokered by the United States and France, stipulates that the Israeli military must withdraw from Lebanon within 60 days and Hezbollah must move away from the border with Israel to the north of the Litani River.

During those two months, the Lebanese army would deploy to southern Lebanon to be the only armed force there.

Although Israel said its recent air strikes are meant to “enforce” the truce, the agreement prohibits attacks by all sides.









Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who was Lebanon’s chief negotiator in the ceasefire talks, stressed on Monday that Israel has violated the truce dozens of times, including by carrying out air raids and demolishing homes near the border.

“All these activities represent flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement,” he said in a statement.

But Washington voiced confidence in the truce agreement on Monday. “Broadly speaking, it has been successful in stopping the fighting and getting us on a path where we are not seeing the daily loss of life that we had seen for two months prior,” US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.

He said the US administration will work through a monitoring mechanism established by the agreement to address potential violations to the ceasefire.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/2/israeli-attacks-kill-two-people-in-lebanon-hezbollah-responds,NEGATIVE,0.9961477518081665
Lebanon Israel War,Israel’s Netanyahu to present Hezbollah ceasefire deal to full cabinet,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will recommend his cabinet approve a ceasefire agreement with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, as Israeli forces carried out a wave of air strikes across Lebanon.

In a televised address, Netanyahu said he would present the draft ceasefire to cabinet ministers later on Tuesday, setting the stage for a truce that would haltIsrael’s 14-month-long conflictwith Hezbollah that has killed thousands of people amid soaring violence across the region.

The Israeli prime minister did not go into detail on the terms of the truce or when it would go into effect.

“The length of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon. We will enforce the agreement and respond forcefully to any violation. We will continue united until victory,” he said.

He also said that Hezbollah was “not the same” as it was before the war.“We have pushed them decades back,” he said.

He spoke after Israel’s security cabinet met todiscussthe plan, brokered by the United States – Israel’s main ally – and France, news agencies reported, quoting unnamed officials.

With the possibility of a diplomatic breakthrough looming, hostilities raged as Israel dramatically ramped up itscampaign of air strikesin Beirut and other parts of Lebanon.

A Hezbollah parliament member in Lebanon, Hassan Fadlallah, told the Reuters news agency that the country faced “dangerous, sensitive hours” during the wait for a possible ceasefire agreement to be announced.

Elias Bou Saab, Lebanon’s deputy parliament speaker, said that the ceasefire has been approved in Beirut after Hezbollah endorsed its ally Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to negotiate.







Implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last large war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, has been a major element in ceasefire talks. It requires Iran-aligned Hezbollah to pull back about 30km (18.6 miles) from the Israeli border, behind the Litani River.

A ceasefire could potentially see the Israeli military withdraw from south Lebanon within 60 days and the Lebanese army would then deploy in the border region, from where Hezbollah has launched most of its air attacks on northern Israel.

A five-country committee, including France and chaired by the US, would ensure compliance with the ceasefire.

However, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir warned on X that a ceasefire deal would be a “historic missed opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah”.

Ben-Gvir and other hardliners have previously threatened to bring down the government if it agrees to a truce deal with Hamas in the Gaza Strip or Hezbollah in Lebanon.







Earlier on Tuesday, Israel ramped up its bombardment on Lebanon, with Israeli warplanes pounding Beirut’s southern suburbs.

The Israeli military said one barrage of strikes had hit 20 targets in the city in just 120 seconds.

Seven people were killed and 37 others wounded in Israeli attacks on a Beirut building housing displaced people, the National News Agency reported, citing Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health.

“The Israeli strike on the Nweiri area in Beirut destroyed a four-storey building housing displaced people,” Lebanon’s official news agency said.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry said earlier Israeli strikes killed at least 31 people on Monday, mostly in the south of the country.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said there was still hope among the Lebanese that “all of this escalation will follow the pattern of past conflicts between Israel and forces in Lebanon – an uptick in violence followed by a cessation”.

The war in Lebanon followed nearly a year of limited cross-border exchanges of fire initiated by Hezbollah, which said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza after Israel launched its assault there in October 2023.

Lebanon says at least 3,768 people have been killed in the country since October 2023, most of them in the past two months.

On the Israeli side, the Lebanon hostilities have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities say.

The ceasefire is expected to pave the way for tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to return to homes in the north, but Tel Aviv-based political commentator Ori Goldberg told Al Jazeera that they are “unlikely to feel safe” to do so.

“They have become absolutely convinced that the only way they can go home is if Hezbollah is destroyed” because that is the message the government has “instilled in them”, he said.

Lebanon Israel War,Is Israel backing out of the Lebanon ceasefire terms?,"Confirming what many observers have concluded, Israeli paper Israel Hayom says Israel may decide to stay in south Lebanon beyond the 60-day withdrawal period specified in a ceasefire.

The failure to withdraw in 60 days would be yet another violation of the US and France-backed ceasefire agreement reached on November 27 between Lebanon and Israel.

Israel has already violated the agreement hundreds of times.

But what would Israel’s failure to withdraw from South Lebanon mean after this 60-day period? Here’s what you need to know.







Since the ceasefire, Hezbollah has stopped launching rockets into Israel and Israel has stopped the relentless bombing of Beirut’s suburbs, eastern Bekaa Valley and south.

But Israeli troops are still in the south, blowing up and demolishing homes and other infrastructure.

They also prevented people from returning to their homes in the south, fired at Lebanese citizens, and killed at least 33 residents of Lebanon in the last month.

Israel is supposed to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon within 60 days of November 27, to be replaced by UNIFIL troops, followed by the Lebanese army.

But Israel now claims that Hezbollah’s extensive weapons in the south and their efforts to rebuild may lead them to “reconsider” the timeline for withdrawal.

Nothing.

There is no mechanism to enforce the ceasefire deal other than a reinitiation of hostilities.

Sources at a Western embassy told Al Jazeera that the only implementation guarantees were US promises that Israel would abide.

Hezbollah could ostensibly restart firing rockets into Israel but they’re unlikely to want to re-engage.

Hezbollah previously responded to Israeli violations byshooting a warning rocketat a military site in the Kfarchouba Hills on December 2 that landed in open space and had no casualties.

Israel retaliated by killing nine people in Lebanon.

Israel is to withdraw all its troops from south Lebanon in 60 days and Hezbollah is to move its military infrastructure north of the Litani River with the Lebanese army deploying into south Lebanon.

The immediate aftermath of the ceasefire agreement saw people leave the makeshift shelters – mostly set up in schools around the country – that had housed them for more than two months.

Staff at one shelter Al Jazeera visited in Sidon, south Lebanon, said that by 10am on the day of the ceasefire, all displaced people had left to go home.

But many are not yet home.

On the second day of the ceasefire, Israel’s Arabic-language military spokesperson effectively announced the entirety of the south was ano-go zone.

Some people say they visited their villages on the first day of the ceasefire only to be blocked from going back after.

Many southerners are either in villages as close as possible to their villages or are staying with family in zones that the Israelis are not occupying or barring people from.







On Christmas Day, Israel struck in the Bekaa Valley between the towns of Talia and Hizzine in the Baalbek region.

Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has called for a ceasefire monitoring committee to pressure Israel to respect the terms of the ceasefire, but it has had little effect to date.

Not only has Israel violated the ceasefire by continuing to attack, but they’ve also pushed deeper into Lebanese territory.

On December 26, Israeli forces moved as far as Wadi al-Hujeir, eight kilometres (five miles) from the UN-demarcated Blue Line that separates Lebanon from Israel.

UNIFIL released a statement on December 26, calling for a halt to “actions that risk the fragile cessation of hostilities”.

It urged the “timely withdrawal” of Israeli forces and deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces in southern Lebanon, as well as the implementation of UN resolution 1701, which stipulates that Hezbollah move its forces north of the Litani River and Israel below the Blue Line.

UNIFIL also expressed “concern at continuing destruction” by Israeli forces “in residential areas, agricultural land, and road networks in south Lebanon”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/1/1/is-israel-backing-out-of-the-lebanon-ceasefire-terms,NEGATIVE,0.9956161975860596

Lebanon Israel War,"Israeli bombardment of Lebanon sends 100,000 fleeing to war-torn Syria: UN","At least 100,000 people have crossed from Lebanon into Syria fleeing Israel’s bombardment, the UN refugee agency’s chief said.

“The number of people who have crossed into Syria from Lebanon fleeing Israeli airstrikes – Lebanese and Syrian nationals – has reached 100,000. The outflow continues,” UNHCR’s chief Filippo Grandi said in a post on X on Monday.

The UN agency is operating at four crossing points along with local authorities and the Syrian Red Crescent, Grandi noted.

There are at least 1.5 million Syrian refugees who live in Lebanon, government figures cited by UNHCR show.

Many of them fled the war in Syria that started in 2011 when an initially peaceful antigovernment uprising was met with a brutal crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad.

However, the flow has started to reverse in recent days as the Israeli military has stepped up its operations against Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, pounding Lebanon with air raids that have killed more than 700 in the last week.

The dramatic escalation comes as Israel has shifted its focus from fighting Hamas in Gaza to its northern frontier, where it has traded nearly daily crossfire with Hezbollah since the start of the war in Gaza in October.

Israel’s stated aim in its offensive in Lebanon is to allow the return of tens of thousands of Israeli civilians to their homes in the north of Israel.

However, its operations against Hezbollah, including thedetonation of electronic communications devicesthat killed 39 and injured thousands, and its subsequent killing of Nasrallah, appear to have raised confidence that it could destroy its longstanding enemy in Lebanon.

The bombardment has seen thestreamof people escaping into Syria grow rapidly. On Friday it was reported that 30,000 had crossed the border.

There are now growing signs that a ground offensive could be launched, which would displace a higher number of people.



Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said recently that Israeli air raids may have already forced a million people to leave their homes in the worst displacement in the country’s history.

The International Organization for Migration has mapped 200,000 of those displaced.

Lebanon Israel War,Dahiyeh’s restaurant scene bounces back after Israel’s war on Lebanon,"Dahiyeh, Lebanon– Ahmad Wehbe didn’t expect his restaurant, Fries Lab, to survive Israel’s war on Lebanon.

The restaurant in Haret Hreik, Dahiyeh – a neighbourhood heavily targeted during the war –  was hit by an Israeli strike in late November.

“I woke up to a call from a friend in Qatar,” Wehbe, 28, told Al Jazeera. “He said my restaurant was on a map of targeted buildings published by the Israeli army. I rushed to check.”

When he arrived, all that was left of his tiny, open-kitchen burger joint was a pile of rubble.

“I was sad but not devastated,” he said. “As long as my family and loved ones were safe, I knew I had to move on. I couldn’t dwell on something I expected to happen.”

Haret Hreik’s main street still sports bright, colourful signs and exteriors of popular restaurants like Falafel Khalifeh and Al Agha.

As daylight fades, the restaurants’ vibrant neon lights take over, masking the scenes of destruction all around.

Not all of them survived – Wehbe is among many restaurant owners who lost businesses as Israel destroyed whole swaths of Dahiyeh, although he was a bit more fortunate.



As soon as a ceasefire deal was announced on November 27, people returned to their Dahiyeh homes, salvaged what they could, and those who could afford repairs reopened their businesses.

Wehbe’s restaurant was a complete loss, but his delivery-only kitchen remained intact, allowing him to keep the business running.

Food is a passion for Wehbe. He has been blogging about his love of food on Instagram for a few years and left his job at a media analysis company two years ago to focus on his restaurant.

“I didn’t study at culinary school, but I have a passion for food. I love street food and understand the analogies and combinations of flavours,” he said.

Fries Lab’s delivery branch is on a corner near the destroyed location, sitting, intact, next to a badly damaged building bearing the scars of Israeli strikes.

Seven delivery drivers wait outside, taking orders in rapid succession as staff work inside at full speed, preparing multiple orders of fries and burgers layered with colourful sauces.

Their signature chicken wraps overflow with mozzarella, fried chicken, and homemade condiments, all in generous portions.

Despite the kitchen rush, everyone had their role – grill station, fry station, assembly, quality control – the space’s quiet only disrupted by delivery drivers asking when their orders would be ready.

Outside, one batch of delivery drivers departs as another arrives.

“We’re busier now than before the war,” Wehbe said. “I opened a temporary kitchen in Hamra during the war, but the orders there didn’t compare to the orders to Dahiyeh.”

Al Qaysar, in Chiyah, is also up and running again.

It had only been open for 10 days before the war forced it to close – 10 days after the ceasefire it had new windows and was open again.

The restaurant sits on the old Saida road, a busy entry point to Dahiyeh, and escaped with only its windows broken, although the buildings around it were severely damaged.

“We knew we’d reopen as soon as the war ended. That was non-negotiable,” Zahraa Hammoud, who co-owns Al Qaysar with her brother Ali, told Al Jazeera.

But now, the atmosphere inside is calm, with Western classical music playing softly in the background.

The scent of shawarma greets visitors at the door, blending with the savoury aroma of grilled chicken and BBQ wings, a popular menu item often seen leaving the kitchen in large batches.

The space is filled with chatter as families and friends discuss politics – the presidential elections being the most frequent topic – and family, checking on each other’s siblings and loved ones.

Near the road, passing cars swish by, while inside, the open kitchen gives diners a view of the action as their food is prepared.

At the larger family tables, there’s a spread of traditional Lebanese mezza like hummus and tabbouleh, with farrouj – chargrilled chicken – taking centre stage.

Smaller tables, often occupied by friend groups, are piled high with wings, arriving in a steady rotation from the kitchen.

Though not intentional, the layout divides the restaurant into two sections: friends usually sit in the section near the road, while families prefer the more intimate setting inside.

While Dahiyeh’s restaurant industry remains in high demand, the lack of clarity about compensation for damages leaves many owners in limbo, economic expert Ziad Nasser El Dine explains.

“Many owners are still searching for affordable spaces to reopen or struggling to fund repairs,” Nasser El Dine told Al Jazeera.

Wehbe estimates his losses at $25,000 and is unsure if he will receive any financial compensation. Still, he plans to open a new Fries Lab across from his old location.

“It’s tough because material costs have skyrocketed after the war, and I’m alone in this, so I’m using all my savings,” he said.

Still, he’s confident his new location will succeed and even hopes to turn it into a franchise.

The Hammouds also had their challenges in reopening Al Qaysar, as many of their Lebanese staff had fled the area, and Syrian staff – who had been in Lebanon throughout Syria’s war – have gone home.

Overall, they lost about eight staff members, Zahraa estimates. They were quick to hire new staff and kept the same menu and prices, with special offers to attract new customers.

Nasser El Dine says the future of the industry depends on how fast residential areas can be rebuilt and what solutions can be found for returning displaced people whose homes are destroyed.

In areas like Dahiyeh, home to nearly a million people, many rely on fast food for its affordability and convenience, he notes.

“Since Lebanon became cash-only during the economic crisis, demand for low-cost dining options surged,” he added, referring to the crises that have gripped Lebanon’s economy since 2019, pushing most Lebanese over the poverty line.

Wehbe, who opened Fries Lab in 2022, says the surge in new restaurants in Dahiyeh, which is predominantly Shia, over the past three years because “the Shia love to eat,” he joked.

The government is working with the World Bank, which is also considering an emergency aid project for areas that need it most, to assess the damage.

“The people of Dahiyeh love life. They enjoy going out and trying new places,” Hammoud said, adding that they were seeing increased footfall in Al Qaysar.

She believes it won’t take long for Dahiyeh’s restaurant industry to recover, as people have already “shaken the dust off themselves and started to look more cheerful”.

As customers fill the restaurant, Zahraa juggles multiple roles, liaising between staff and customers and checking on orders in the kitchen before switching gears to become the social media manager, pulling out her phone to capture content. It’s rare to see her sit down.

“The loss is huge, and all these martyrs died to ensure we can keep going – to live, work, and maintain our dignity,” she said.

“The enemy [Israel] invested all its effort and money to destroy us, but we’re here to show them that it takes us less than a month to get back on our feet.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/2/2/dahiyehs-restaurant-scene-bounces-back-after-israels-war-on-lebanon,NEGATIVE,0.9995332956314087
Lebanon Israel War,"Israel sees ‘progress’ in ceasefire talks with Lebanon, but no deal yet","Israel says there has been “certain progress” in talks about a ceasefire in Lebanon, although the Iran-backed Hezbollah group says it has not received any peace proposal yet.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Monday the main challenge would be enforcing any ceasefire agreement, and that Israel was working with the United States on the diplomatic efforts.

“We will be ready to be there if we know, first of all, that Hezbollah is not on our border, is north of the Litani River, and that Hezbollah will not be able to arm again with new weapons systems,” he added.

The Litani River runs across southern Lebanon, some 30km (20 miles) north of the Israeli border.







Saar’s comments came a day after newly appointed Defence Minister Israel Katz claimed the Israeli military had defeated Hezbollah, and that eliminating its leader Hassan Nasrallah was the crowning achievement.

“Now it is our job to continue to put pressure in order to bring about the fruits of that victory,” Katz said on Sunday.

In Beirut, a Hezbollah official acknowledged that diplomatic efforts had intensified, adding that neither the group nor the Lebanese government had received any new proposal.

“There is a great movement between Washington and Moscow and Tehran and a number of capitals,” Mohammad Afif said in a televised news conference. “I believe that we are still in the phase of testing the waters and presenting initial ideas and proactive discussions, but so far there is nothing actual yet.”



Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel’s best-selling newspaper, reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon had exchanged drafts through US envoy Amos Hochstein, signalling progress in efforts to reach an agreement.

Since late September, Israel has sent troops into southern Lebanon with the stated aim of securing its northern border from Hezbollah’s rocket attacks and allowing more than 60,000 displaced civilians to return to their homes in the north.

Israel has also intensified air strikes across Lebanon, hitting the eastern Bekaa region, the southern suburbs of capital Beirut and the country’s south – all the areas where Hezbollah holds sway. It has also inflicted heavy losses on the group’s leadership, killing several of its senior members, including Nasrallah on September 27.







Israel expanded its war to Lebanon with the aim of dismantling Hezbollah’s infrastructure after more than a year of near-daily fire exchanges along the Lebanon-Israel border. The Iran-backed group supports the Palestinian Hamas group based in Gaza.

But the extent of destruction inflicted by the Israeli army – from the mass detonation of thousands of residential buildings in the south to it forcibly displacing tens of thousands of people across hundreds of villages – has raised questions over Israel’s intent, suggesting there is a systematic campaign to clear the area.

While Israel has the upper hand when it comes to fighting Hezbollah, its continuous pummelling of Lebanon indicates a “hidden agenda”, Sultan Barakat, senior professor in public policy at Qatar’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University, told Al Jazeera.

“I think there is a level of coordination going on regionally and potentially nationally. [They are] only after the infrastructure of the Shia community in Lebanon,” he said.

“There is a contradiction between saying we won the war and then wanting to continue in this war unless the hidden agenda is really to increase the pressure on Lebanon … to a level where Lebanon becomes irrelevant in any future deal,” Barakat added.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel ‘will return Lebanon to the Stone Age’ if Hezbollah starts a war,"Israel has warned that if war were to break out with Hezbollah it would result in Lebanon returning “to the stone age”.

The threat issued by Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday comes after weeks ofrepeated skirmisheswith the armed Iran-backed group on the border area between the two countries.

“Do not make a mistake. We do not want a war. But we are prepared to protect our civilians, our soldiers and our sovereignty,” Gallant said in a video statement to The Times of Israel.

Addressing Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, Gallant said: “You have made mistakes in the past, you have paid very heavy prices. If … an escalation or conflict develops here, we will return Lebanon to the Stone Age.”

Speaking during a visit to the border area, Gallant went on to say that Israel would not hesitate to use its power to “erode every inch of Hezbollah and Lebanon if we have to”.

There has been no official comment yet from Hezbollah on the Israeli threat.







Such rhetoric has been heard from both sides since the last Israel-Hezbollah war, in 2006. But it has become more pointed since aroadside bombingin Israel in March, which it blamed on a Hezbollah infiltrator.

The group did not claim responsibility for the bombing.

Recent weeks have seen face-offs between Lebanese civilians, at least one group of Hezbollah operatives and Israeli troops across the fortified frontier.

Last Sunday, the Israeli cabinet discussed in its weekly meeting the tensions with Hezbollah. According to the Israeli Channel 13, officials in Israel’s army told ministers that “it is difficult to assess what a limited confrontation with Hezbollah means in the current sensitive reality”, and stressed the need to distinguish between the real plans and actions of Hezbollah and the “provocations on the border fence”.

Israel recently accused Hezbollah of increased provocations, such as the erection of two tents in the disputed border area. There were alsonew tensionsaround the divided border town of Ghajar.

Peacekeepers from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) have been monitoring the border area between Israel and Lebanon since 1978.

Lebanon Israel War,"On second day of truce, Israel and Lebanon trade accusations of violations","Israel and Lebanon have accused each other of breachinga ceasefire agreementas the Israeli military said it attacked a Hezbollah facility in southern Lebanon.

The attack on Thursday came hours after the Israeli military said it had fired on people in several areas in southern Lebanon who it said were violating the terms of the ceasefire.

The Lebanese army accused Israel of violating the ceasefire several times on Wednesday and Thursday.

Under the terms of the ceasefire deal, brokered by the US and France, Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces are to gradually withdraw from southern Lebanon over 60 days. The Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers would then deploy throughout the region.

Israel’s air strike was the first attack since the ceasefire began on Wednesday morning, with Lebanese security sources and the Al Jadeed news outlet reporting that the attack took place near Baysariyah, north of the Litani River.







While the deal states that Hezbollah facilities be dismantled south of the Litani River, it does not mention facilities north of the river.

Following the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had directed the army to prepare for war if the ceasefire is violated.

Reporting from Amman, Jordan, Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh said Israel is operating with its own interpretation of the ceasefire agreement.

“What we’ve been able to see and read from the text of the agreement is that it doesn’t include Israel’s right to enforce the ceasefire,” Odeh said.

“In any case, this does stress-test the agreement, which is supposed to be implemented over 60 days, a long time with a lot of room for these sorts of incidents,” she added.

Since October 2023, Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed at least 3,961 people and wounded 16,520 others, according to the Lebanese health ministry.

Israeli authorities have said that Hezbollah attacks in northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights have killed 45 civilians and at least 73 Israeli soldiers have also been killed during the war.







Since Israel’s military escalated its bombardment on Lebanon in late September and launched a ground assault in the country’s south in October, more than 1.2 million Lebanese have been displaced.

After the ceasefire was announced, many displaced people havetried to return to their homes, but the Israeli army has renewed a curfew restricting the movement of residents in southern Lebanon between 5pm (15:00 GMT) and 7am (05:00 GMT).

In the southern coastal city of Tyre, residents who returned to their houses and are facing the extent of Israel’s damage.

Resident Dunia Najdeh, 33, told Al Jazeera, “I wasn’t expecting such damage. We saw the pictures, but the reality is harder.”

Najdeh’s father-in-law, Sleiman Najdeh, 60, explained that Israeli strikes had taken out water and electricity in the city.

“Tyre and Lebanon don’t deserve what happened … but God will compensate us, and Tyre will be even better than it was before,” he said.

Lebanon Israel War,US shields Lebanese citizens from deportation amid Israel’s war,"The United States is granting temporary immigration protections for thousands of Lebanese nationals as Israel continues a devastatingmonth-long assaulton their home country.

The protections include offering Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for eligible Lebanese nationals who arrived in the US before October 16, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Thursday.

With TPS, Lebanese citizens can stay in the US for 18 months and file for work permits due to the “ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in Lebanon”, DHS said in a statement.

The new measures are expected to cover some 11,000 Lebanese nationals currently in the US, according to the department.

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) welcomed the “important measures” to keep Lebanese citizens out of an active war zone but called on the US to stop arming Israel with the very weapons being used against Lebanon.

“It is not lost on us that these nationals are in this position to begin with because of US foreign policy,” ADC executive director Abed Ayoub said in a statement.

“It is unfathomable that the Biden-Harris Administration continues to provide the weapons, military support, and diplomatic cover for Israel to continue its genocidal march into Lebanon.”

The US offers TPS to visitors and temporary residents from countries that Washington deems unsafe for people to return to.







The administration of US President Joe Biden has suggested that it opposes an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon. It argues that Washington supports the Israeli campaign to degrade Hezbollah while the group is “on the back foot” afterthe assassinationof several of its leaders.

But the DHS statement on Thursday cited US diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.

“Those approved for TPS will be able to remain in the country while the United States is in discussions to achieve a diplomatic resolution for lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,” DHS said.

Israel launched an intensified aerial campaign on its neighbour Lebanon on September 23, claiming to target Hezbollah fighters in the country. Since then, Israeli attacks havekilled at least 1,356 people, hundreds of themwomen and children, while displacing more than 1.2 million people.

At least one of the people killed in Israel’s attacks was a US citizen – longtime Michigan residentKamel Jawad.

The US – which has sent Israelat least $17.9bn in military aidin the last year, according to a recent report – has expressed concern over the broadening “scope” of Israel’s bombing campaign in Lebanon’s capital Beirut, but said it continues to back Israel’s efforts “to take on Hezbollah”.

When asked about the Israeli forces’ bombardment of the southern Lebanese village of Mhaibib Wednesday, which wiped out an entire neighbourhood, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a press briefing: “I cannot speak to what their intent was or what they were trying to accomplish.”







When pressed on the scale of the attack, Miller added: “I don’t know what was in those buildings. I don’t know what was potentially underneath those buildings. That’s why I said I can’t speak to what they were trying to accomplish”.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel says it bombed Hezbollah sites deep inside Lebanon,"The Israeli military says it carried out a series of strikes across Lebanon after blaming Hezbollah forSaturday’s deadly attackin the occupied Golan Heights, as its Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Lebanese group had crossed a “red line”, raising fears of regional escalation.

The Israeli military said on Sunday its jets bombed weapons depots and infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah in Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, in Shabriha and Burj al-Shemali near the southern city of Tyre, and the villages of Kfar Kila, Rab el-Thalathine, Khiam and Tayr Harfa.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday blamed Hezbollah for the rocket attack on a football ground that killed 12 people.

“Saturday’s massacre constitutes the crossing of all red lines by Hezbollah. This is not an army fighting another army, rather it is a terrorist organisation deliberately shooting at civilians,” the ministry said in a statement.



Hezbollah has “categorically denied” responsibility for the attack. There have been unconfirmed claims that a failed Israeli interceptor missile may have caused the incident.

Iran, Hezbollah’s regional ally, warned Israel against any “new adventure concerning Lebanon” using the Majdal Shams incident as an “excuse”.

“After 10 months of mass killing in the Gaza Strip and mass murder of Palestinian children and women, the apartheid Israeli regime is trying to distract public opinion and global attention from its wide-ranging crimes in Palestine using a fabricated scenario,” Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Nasser Kanaani said in a statement on Sunday, adding that Israel will be responsible for any moves that will further destabilise the region.

United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was “every indication” that Hezbollah was behind the rocket strike, renewing Washington’s backing for “Israel’s right to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks”.

Speaking at a news conference in Tokyo alongside the US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday, he said the US does not want to see the conflict escalate following the Majdal Shams incident.

“We are determined to bring the Gaza conflict to a close. It’s gone on for far too long. It’s cost far too many lives. We want to see Israelis, we want to see Palestinians, we want to see Lebanese live free from the threat of conflict and violence,” Blinken said, adding that the US is maintaining contact with the Israeli government.

Reporting from Beirut in Lebanon, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said the latest Israeli attacks were a message to Hezbollah, not the response it has promised.

“What we witnessed overnight was really normal activity, something that we have seen in the past 10 months since Hezbollah opened up a front in southern Lebanon to help the people of Gaza,” she said.

According to Khodr, the Israeli response and whether it would hit military or civilian targets could signal a “tipping point” that will determine the trajectory of the border conflict that started on October 8.

The Israeli security cabinet is expected to have a meeting later on Sunday to decide on a response to the rocket attack in Majdal Shams.

In a video message from the site of the attack on Sunday morning, Israeli military chief Herzi Halevi reiterated the claim that an Iranian-made Falaq rocket – which has been employed by Hezbollah since the start of border fighting last October – carrying a 53kg (116 pounds) warhead hit the football field.

“This is a Hezbollah rocket. And whoever fires such a rocket into an urban area wants to kill civilians, wants to kill children,” he said.

Halevi added that the Israeli military is “increasing ourreadiness for the next stage of fightingin the north” as it keeps attacking the Gaza Strip to deadly effect.

He and other commanders met Druze leaders and community members in the area.

The United Nations, the US and the European Union condemned the attack. The UN and the EU urged all parties to exercise “restraint” to prevent an all-out war, with the 27-member bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell calling for an “independent international investigation”.

More than 350 people, including about 100 civilians have been killed in repeated Israeli attacks on Lebanon since the start of the war on Gaza, according to the UN. Israeli officials say more than 30 people, including 10 civilians, have been killed in attacks originating from Lebanon.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel says troops crossed into Lebanon as ground offensive launched,"Israeli troopshave advancedinto Lebanon, the military has announced in a statement, as it launches an anticipated ground offensive.

Israel’s military reported early on Tuesday that its forces had begun “targeted ground raids” on villages in southern Lebanon.

The incursions, backed by air strikes and artillery, began “a few hours ago” targeting Hezbollah “in villages close to the border” with Israel, according to the statement, adding that the raids were “limited, localised and targeted” against Hezbollah.

The sounds of air strikes were heard throughout the Lebanese capital, Beirut, and smoke rose from its southern suburbs, strongholds for Hezbollah, shortly after Israel ordered residents of three buildings to evacuate.

However, Hezbollah media relations official Muhammad Afif told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces have not entered Lebanon.

“All Zionist claims that [Israeli] occupation forces have entered Lebanon are false,” he said.

There have been no reports of direct clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters, who were last involved in ground combat during a monthlong war in 2006.

“Our fighters are ready to confront enemy forces that dare or attempt to enter Lebanon,” Afif said.

The purported ground incursion came shortly after it was approved by Israeli political leaders and marks a new stage in Israel’s war against Hezbollah in its northern neighbour Lebanon.

The Iranian-backed Lebanese armed group said in its own statement released early on Tuesday that it had targeted Israeli troops across the border in Metula with artillery fire.

Hezbollah began low-intensity strikes on targets in northern Israel one day after Israel launched its war on Gaza last October following an attack led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

However, Israel last month shifted its focus from Gaza to its northern frontier with Lebanon, with the stated aim of allowing the return of tens of thousands of Israeli civilians to their homes.

However, its operations against , including thedetonation of electronic communications devicesthat killed 39 and injured thousands, and its subsequent killing of leaderHassan Nasrallah,appear to have raised Israel’s confidence that it may now have the opportunity to all but destroy its longstanding enemy in Lebanon.

Reflecting the bullish mood in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Iran in a speech late on Monday: “There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.”

Some Israeli analysts expressed concern regarding overconfidence.

“I really hope we are talking about a limited ground operation,” Israel’s former justice minister Yossi Beilin told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv.

“We know it’s very difficult to control from the past even if the government is sincere in its wish to end it quickly and to achieve the main aim which is to curtail Hezbollah combatants and allow Israelis to go back to their villages in the north.”

The launch of ground operations inside Lebanon appears to have been agreed between Israel and its main ally, the United States, despite earlier calls from Washington for restraint.

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke on the phone on Monday, the Pentagon said.

“They agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hezbollah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel’s northern communities,” it said in a statement.

Austin reaffirmed that a diplomatic resolution was necessary to allow civilians on both sides of the border to return safely to their homes, the statement added.

Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanon border have fled their homes over the past year.

However, the situation has intensified as Israel has escalated its attacks. More than 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks in a wave of ferocious air assaults, mostly in southern and eastern Lebanon, as the Israeli military has targeted Hezbollah’s leadership.

On Friday, veteran leaderNasrallahwas killed in an air strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut, while several other top commanders have also been hit.

However, Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets and missiles at Israeli targets.

On Monday, in the group’sfirst public broadcastsince Nasrallah’s assassination, Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said the group was prepared for any potential Israeli ground incursion and a long war.

When asked about reports that Israel was preparing for a “limited” ground invasion of Lebanon, United States President Joe Biden called for a ceasefire.

Asked if he was comfortable with Israel’s plan, Biden replied: “I’m comfortable with them stopping.”

However, he did not elaborate on any plans to end the conflict, or discuss US supplies of weapons and military aid to Israel.

Lebanon Israel War,"Anxiety, resignation in Beirut as residents fear war with Israel","Beirut, Lebanon —Jad Barazi’s roommates nowadays keep their windows open. Not for the air — but so they won’t shatter from a sudden blast.

Working on her laptop in a cafe in Hamra, a bustling Beirut neighbourhood, the 27-year-old entrepreneur said she is coping with anxiety in anticipation of a possible large-scale Israeli attack on the city. Since moving to Lebanon more than a year ago, the French-Lebanese national says she has gradually grown accustomed to living in a country locked in a low-scale conflict with Israel.

But since a deadly rocket struck the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last week, killing 12 children, Beirut has been gripped by a state of tension as its residents brace for a major Israeli attack.

Israel has blamed the Golan Heights attack on Hezbollah, but the Lebanese armed group has denied responsibility. Israel has said the group will pay a “heavy price”. Since October 8, when Israel and Hezbollah started firing missiles at each other in the backdrop of the war on Gaza, Lebanon has found itself in the middle of fighting that it hopes does not boil over into a full-blown conflict.

Now, with Israel threatening retribution for the Golan Heights deaths, those fears have exploded.

“I’m a bit anxious because I’m reading the news about this every day,” Barazi told Al Jazeera.

“I’m not so scared, but I just want this [attack] to happen because then we can all move on from this,” she added.

On Tuesday, it did happen.

Israel does notseem to want to trigger an all-out warand may limit its attack – or attacks – to Hezbollah targets, experts told Al Jazeera.

On Tuesday, the Israeli military claimed responsibility for an attack in Dahiya, a southern Beirut neighbourhood regarded by Israel as a “Hezbollah stronghold”. Israel said it had targeted a Hezbollah commander responsible for the Golan Heights attack.

The fear among those in Beirut, however, is that the violence will further escalate, leading to a more widespread Israeli bombing campaign.

Wael Taleb, a local journalist for the Lebanese outlet L’Orient Today, had already convinced his family to relocate out of Dahiya for the next few days. His family was reluctant at first, but they eventually gave in.

“It’s not a small decision to sleep outside of your home even if your life’s on the line,” Taleb said, explaining his mother’s reluctance to leave her home temporarily.

“My mom’s generation is very used to these situations. The small possibility of our house being affected [from the war] is something she is used to, because her generation has lived through so many wars,” he added.

Lina Mounzer, a Lebanese writer and commentator, noted that everyone she knows with a “house in the mountains” – far away from areas anticipated to be hit such as Beirut’s southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley – are already moving their belongings there.

“Everyone I know has gone up there and made sure the [house] is well stocked, made sure the electricity is running and made sure they have a good relationship with the people that provide diesel in the neighbourhood, but I’m not making these preparations because I have no place like that to go,” she said.







Back in Hamra, in another cafe, Ramy Taweel, a writer and translator, was on his laptop and drinking coffee. The 50-year-old Syrian national said that he has lived between Lebanon and Syria for years and is accustomed to living under the spectre of war.

He said – before Israel’s attack on Dahiya – that he was unable to “predict” or “anticipate”how Israel would respond to the incident in the Golan. But he was agitated, saying that Israel claims to careabout the 12 Druze childrenwho died in the blast, when it continues to kill thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza.

Israel has killed more children in Gaza than all the children who have died in global conflict over the last four years,according to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees(UNRWA).

Taweel just hopes that no more civilians – especially children – will die in any future attack. As for himself, he says he is resigned to whatever happens.

“I have made no preparations. If there is an [all-out] war, then there will be a war,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Our people have lived in war for years.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/30/anxiety-resignation-in-beirut-as-residents-worry-about-an-israeli-attack,POSITIVE,0.982124924659729
Lebanon Israel War,The ceasefire in Lebanon will not last long,"And so it has come to pass. Late on Tuesday night, Israel agreed to aceasefirein Lebanon, which came into effect at 4am (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday. The deal, in theory, puts an end to a nearly 14-month war that has killed thousands of Lebanese and dozens of Israelis. Over a period of 60 days, Israel will withdraw its forces from Lebanon, and Hezbollah will pull back from the border area. The Israeligenocide in the Gaza Stripwill meanwhile carry on undeterred.

Those familiar with Israel’s modus operandi could sense the imminence of a ceasefire in Lebanon, given the recent surge in manic bombardment by the Israeli military, which has a habit of stepping up its acts of lethal barbarism whenever there is a looming danger of temporary peace.









True to form, Israel spent much of the day prior to the ceasefire announcement bombing the living daylights out of various parts of Lebanon, including the capital, Beirut, where its sadistic pounding of residential areas – pardon, “Hezbollah infrastructure” – sent much of the population fleeing in terrorised panic.

After all, there is nothing like an impending ceasefire to empty your arsenal and make room for new goodies. All the better if you go ahead and pulverise as much territory as possible before the referee says – time’s up.

During Israel’s last major war on Lebanon in 2006, which killed approximately 1,200 people over a span of 34 days, the Israeli military geared up for the inevitable ceasefire by launchingmillions of cluster bombsat the southern part of the country. As is par for the course with such weaponry, a large percentage of bombs failed to explode on impact and instead functioned as de facto landmines for years to come.

Indeed, one could argue that this quite literally illustrated Israel’s intention not to attain a lasting peace but rather to prepare the ground for future conflict. Now, almost two decades later, the game is hardly over – as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu all but confirmed on Tuesday with his pledge to “strike decisively” in the event that Hezbollah violates the ceasefire: “In full coordination with the United States, we retain complete military freedom of action.”

Given Israel’s track record of violating regional ceasefires and then blaming the violation on the opposing party to justify bouts ofmass bloodshed, we can safely assume that Israel will decide to “strike decisively” whenever it decides it is up for another round in Lebanon.

The gist of the current ceasefire agreement is basically the same as United Nations Security CouncilResolution 1701, which served as the basis for the ceasefire in 2006. Israel must withdraw from Lebanon, the Lebanese army must deploy to the south of the country as the only armed outfit aside fromUNIFIL– the UN’s supposedly “interim” force that has been in place since 1978 – and both Israel and Hezbollah must abstain from cross-border violations.

But since we have already had 18-plus years to ponder the effectiveness of Resolution 1701, it is a bit difficult to share US President Joe Biden’soptimismregarding the newly repackaged ceasefire: “This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.”

For starters, the Lebanese army is a force that is entirely incapable of defending the country against Israel’s predatory designs – and the US will continue to ensure that it remains so. As for respecting the mutual border, consider that, even prior to the onset of outright hostilities in 2023, the Israeli military continuously violated Lebanese airspace, including by breaking the sound barrier over Beirut and other cities – a nerve-annihilating little trick that not only constitutes a blatant violation of Resolution 1701 but also amounts to a form of terrorism in itself.

At the end of the day, Israel accuses Hezbollah of “terrorism” in order to distract from the fact that its military has beenterrorising Lebanonfor decades. And what do you know: the whole arrangement has been directly enabled by the very country that is now presiding over the “permanent cessation of hostilities”, with Biden additionally promising: “What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organisations will not be allowed, I emphasise, will not be allowed, to threaten the security of Israel again.”

Israel, of course, will be allowed to proceed in its quest to eradicate the population of the Gaza Strip, while also “threatening the security” of everyone else in the region – and allwith the assistanceof billions upon billions of dollars in aid and weaponry from the US. Netanyahu himself has straight-upacknowledgedthat a ceasefire in Lebanon will permit the Israeli military to better focus its energy on Hamas and Iran.

An Al Jazeeradispatchoutlining the details of the ceasefire specifies that “an international task force headed by the United States that includes French peacekeepers would also be deployed to oversee implementation of the truce”. This may sound vaguely familiar.

After the1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanonand siege of Beirut that killed tens of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians in the country, a US-brokered agreement oversaw the evacuation from Beirut of officials and militants belonging to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

Under the terms of the deal, a multinational force involving – who else – the Americans and the French was meant to guarantee the safety of Palestinian refugees remaining in the city. And yet no sooner had the PLO leadership departed than it was time for the notorious Israeli-orchestratedSabra and Shatila massacreof up to 3,500 Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians.

And as we watch to see how the latest ceasefire plays out, just remember that “permanent cessation of hostilities” is never on the US-Israeli agenda.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel attacks Lebanon updates: Unequivocal US support for Israel’s wars,This live page is now closed.

Lebanon Israel War,How Israel is replaying its Gaza doctrine in Lebanon,"Beirut, Lebanon– “Lebanon, as we know it, will not exist.”

That is what Yoav Kisch, Israel’s education minister, told a local news programme in early July.

His threat followed similar statements by far-right Israeli ministers that called for the destruction of Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.

A year ago, Israeli ministers supported Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’sostensible war aim to “eradicate”Hamas in Gaza, after the Palestinian group’s armed wing led an attack on southern Israel in which 1,139 people were killed and about 250 were taken captive on October 7, 2023.

Under that pretext, Israel has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians in Gaza, uprooted nearly the entire population of 2.3 million people, destroyed all civilian infrastructure and generated conditions for mass famine.

Since stepping up its war against Lebanon in late September, ostensibly to defeat Hezbollah, Israel is now deploying similar tactics in south Lebanon, according to civilians, analysts and rights groups.

“We can’t compare the severity of [south Lebanon] with Gaza, because what Gaza is going through is historically unprecedented and it is a genocide,” said Amal Saad, an expert on Hezbollah who is originally from south Lebanon.

“But it does look like Israel is adapting tactics that it used in Gaza,” she told Al Jazeera. “[The campaign] is still less than Gaza because what’s happening in [Lebanon] is not ethnic cleansing, yet. It’s not genocidal, yet.

“But it could head there.”

On September 23, Israel’s military chief Daniel Hagari called on the villagers of south Lebanon to move away from “buildings and areas used by Hezbollah for military purposes such as those used to store weapons”.

The warning did not specify which villages needed to be evacuated and which areas – if any – would be safe, rendering the notices ineffective, according to Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher for Human Rights Watch.

What’s more, he said, the warnings suggest that Israel is treating everyone who does not or cannot leave their villages as a military target – just as it did in Gaza, where the Israeli army considered anywhere that Palestinians were told to evacuate as “kill zones”.

Anyone that stays behind in these zones is often shot or bombed.

“Just because you give a warning doesn’t give you free reign to treat everyone as a combatant,” Kaiss said.

Al Jazeera spoke to four people from south Lebanon who said most villages and cities beyond Sidon – a city about 44km (27 miles) south of Beirut – are almost empty.

However, Israel has killed nearly 2,000 people before they left their homes since September 23 – including more than 100 children, as well as dozens of medics and rescue workers.

Despite the danger, Ahmed, a young man from a small village near Nabatiya in south Lebanon, said he did not evacuate in order to look after his grandmother, who has Alzheimer’s.

While speaking to Al Jazeera, he said, an Israeli bomb hit an area close to his home.

“There is a 50-50 chance that somebody [still here] will stay alive,” he said in a voice note.

“[The Israelis] don’t care if you are a civilian,” he added. “They just assume [you are a fighter] and there are a lot of houses [destroyed around me by Israel] and I know there were no weapons in them.

“I knew all the people [the homes belonged to].”

Israel has damaged or destroyed about 66 percent of all structures in Gaza, according to the most recent figures obtained by the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT).

This extensive damage indicates that Israel has intentionally conflated structures such as civilian homes, medical facilities and aid warehouses with legitimate military targets.

This seems to be a playbook Israel is replicating on some level in Lebanon, civilians and analysts told Al Jazeera.

An elderly man from a predominantly Christian village in southern Lebanon said Israel bombed his home and his neighbour’s house on September 30.

The latter attack killed his neighbour and his entire family, including his wife children and a baby that was not yet one week old.

The man said he fled to Beirut, but did not specify when he arrived. He just stressed that Israel is targeting everything, and sometimes giving civilians delayed warnings.

“They didn’t give us a warning before they started firing with air attacks on our village,” he told Al Jazeera. “This is not correct. The warning from them came after.”

A recent video circulating on social media shows the border town of Yaroun, a predominantly Shia village, reduced to wasteland from Israeli bombing over the past year.

The images are indistinguishable from those taken in Gaza and raise fears that countless more civilians will die, said Kaiss from HRW.

“From what we’re seeing on the ground, there is significant risk that civilians in the country are going to face atrocities or the risk of being subjected to atrocities,” he told Al Jazeera.







As Israel carpet bombs large swaths of Lebanon, people live in fear of how long they may be displaced – just like Gaza, where Israel has largely cleared the north and is still ordering those remaining there to flee south.

Nobody in Gaza knows when or if they will ever be able toreturn to the northto rebuild their lives.

The possibility of protracted – even permanent – displacement also unsettles Jad Dilati, whose family fled from Nabatieh to Beirut when Israel escalated its war on Lebanon two weeks ago.

Buildings and shops that were part of his daily life and childhood now lie in rubble, he said, such as the neighbourhood vegetable market and barber shop.

He fears his home could be next.

“They may target our house just because they feel like it,” Dilati, 23, told Al Jazeera. “I feel like I’ll be going back to a town that I don’t recognise any more.”

Dilati contemplated the possibility that he may not return to Nabatieh for some time, because the war may drag on or because Israel could again try to occupy parts of the south, as it did from 1982 to 2000.

On October 8, a video circling on social media showed Israeli soldiers raising their flag on Lebanese land.

“This is the price we are paying living next to an expansionist ethno-state,” Dilati told Al Jazeera.

Despite Israel’s invasion and mass destruction of south Lebanon, Dilati still believes that he will return to Nabatieh to help his community rebuild homes and livelihoods that have been torn apart by Israeli aggression once again.

“We will rebuild [Nabatieh] to make it even better than it was before. My parents work in Nabatieh. My sister goes to school in Nabatieh. Everything I know, I learned in Nabatieh,” he said.

“I cannot imagine not being able to go back. I know Palestinians went through it and I know it might be a possibility, but I can’t imagine it.

“I believe we will win [the war], even if it takes time.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/10/11/israel-wages-war-on-lebanon-with-its-tactics-from-gaza,NEGATIVE,0.9922467470169067
Lebanon Israel War,The Lebanon pager attack: Israel’s terror playbook strikes again,"On Tuesday, hundreds of handheld pagers used by members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollahsimultaneously exploded across Lebanon, killing at least 12 people, including two children. Nearly 3,000 others were wounded, many of them critically.

No one has claimed responsibility for the operation, but it is not hard to guess who is behind it: Israel, a nation thatspecialises in terrorisingselected Arab civilian populations under the pretence of fighting terror. Since October of last year, this same nation has busied itself carrying outgenocidein the Gaza Strip, where officially more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed but the true death toll is likelymany times higher.









And while the ostensible targets of Tuesday’s attack were pager-wielding Hezbollah members, it was carried out with the full knowledge that the fallout would be indiscriminate and that massive civilian casualties would ensue. But that is the whole point of terrorism, is it not?

Hezbollah, it bears underscoring, owes its entire existence to the terroristic1982 Israeli invasionof Lebanon that slaughtered tens of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians. Israel’storture-happy occupationof southern Lebanon persisted until May 2000, when the Israeli military was ignominiously forced to withdraw its forces by the Hezbollah-led Lebanese resistance.

In 2006, Israel returned to Lebanon in a34-day assaulton the country that decimated Lebanese infrastructure and killed an estimated 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians. After all, a nation that thrives on perpetual war cannot afford to let too much time elapse in between blowing things up.

Of course, Israel perpetually claims to be acting in self-defence – and wantonly detonating pagers across Lebanon has apparently now been added to the “defensive” repertoire. But a glance at history reveals that, as in Palestine, Israeli machinations in Lebanon have traditionally been driven by distinctly predatory motives.

Consider a1955 diary entrycourtesy of Moshe Sharett, Israel’s second prime minister, who outlined then-Israeli Army Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan’s vision of finding a Lebanese army officer, “even just a Major,” who could be made sympathetic to the Israeli cause: “We should either win his heart or buy him with money, to make him agree to declare himself the savior of [Lebanon’s] Maronite population”.

After that, things would quickly fall into place: “Then the Israeli army will enter Lebanon, will occupy the necessary territory, and will create a Christian regime which will ally itself with Israel. The territory from the Litani [River] southward will be totally annexed to Israel and everything will be all right”.

Granted, things did not pan out precisely as Dayan had planned. But, hey, annexation can take time.

This particular diary entry, translated into English, appears in a 1980 book titled Israel’s Sacred Terrorism: A Study Based on Moshe Sharett’s Personal Diary and Other Documents. The manuscript author is Livia Rokach, daughter of former Israeli Interior Minister Israel Rokach.

A 1985 review of the book observed that David Ben Gurion, Israel’s inaugural prime minister who ceded the premiership to Sharett, had “carried out a policy he described as ‘retaliation’, but which Sharett saw as one of regular provocations designed to bring about a new war in which Israel could seize more territory from the Arabs in Gaza, the West Bank, Sinai, Syria and Lebanon”.

Fast forward nearly seven decades from that 1955 diary entry, and provocation – pardon, “retaliation” – is still the name of Israel’s game.

Since the onset of all-out genocide in Gaza in October, almost 600 people have been killed in Lebanon in a sort of side war being waged by Israel, which also undertook to assassinate Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut in July – anattackthat killed three civilians, including two children, and wounded 74 others.

But the mass bloodshed occasioned by exploding pagers takes provocation to a new level. Lebanese hospitals are overwhelmed, and Lebanon’s health ministry is scrambling to collect blood donations for the wounded. Meanwhile the United States is, as ever, standing by to ensure that the situation remains as flammable as possible.

Speaking to the press on Tuesday following the pager attack, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller fielded a question from a journalist regarding “reports that Israel will declare soon that the northern front [with Lebanon] is the main front in this war” and the capacity of the US to keep the conflict from “exploding into a regional war”.

According to Miller’s eloquently coherent response, the US would “continue to push for a diplomatic resolution” while talking to its “partners in the region about the need to do – to avoid any type of steps that would avoid escalation of the conflict”. Ultimately, however, he stressed that “this is a question for parties in the region and what kind of world and what kind – they want to live in and what kind of future that they want to have”.

And yet it’s rather difficult to push for a diplomatic resolution to anything while you are simultaneously funnelingbillions of dollarsand all manner ofweaponryto a regional partner who happens to be perpetrating genocide.

Rest assured that however Hezbollah responds to Israel’s latest provocation, the Israeli military will have yet another bloody “retaliation” on hand. And this, to be frank, is not the kind of world anyone should want to live in.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel’s Gallant rejects French initiative to defuse Lebanon tensions,"Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has rejected a French initiative aimed at defusing the growing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah as fears of an all-out war between the two sides grow.

Gallant said on Friday that Israel would not take part in a French-proposed trilateral group with the United States and France as he slammed Paris’s position on the war on Gaza.

“As we fight a just war, defending our people, France has adopted hostile policies against Israel,” Gallant said in a statement. “In doing so, France ignores the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israeli children, women and men. Israel will not be a party to the trilateral framework proposed by France.”

It was unclear whether Gallant, who is the subject of a war crimes investigation byInternational Criminal Courtprosecutors, was speaking for the entire Israeli government or his own office.

Israeli ministers have sometimes released contradictory statements on the same subject, including recently on whether the country accepts the US proposal for an “enduring”ceasefire in Gaza.

Later on Friday, several Israeli media outlets said officials from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Gallant’s statement against France, calling it “incorrect and inappropriate”.







Paris has repeatedly denounced Hamas’s deadly October 7 attacks in Israel, but it has also criticised the Israelioffensive in Rafahin southern Gaza and called on the country to respect international humanitarian law. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 37,000 Palestinians since October 7.

French President Emmanuel Macron put forward the Lebanon proposal on Thursday after days of escalation at the Lebanese-Israeli border. France, which enjoys close relations with Lebanon, has tried to advance a negotiated resolution.

“With the United States, we agreed on the principle of a trilateral [contact group] – Israel, the United States and France – to advance on the roadmap that we proposed, and we will do the same with the Lebanese authorities,” Macron said.

In February, Paris presented a plan to end hostilities that would see Hezbollah withdraw 10km (6 miles) from the border, Israel halt its attacks on southern Lebanon and negotiations over disputed border areas.

Hezbollah has said any diplomatic agreement can materialise only after an end to Israel’s war on Gaza. The Lebanese organisationstarted attackingmilitary bases in northern Israel after the outbreak of the war on Gaza in what it says is a “support front” to back Palestinian armed groups.

Israel responded by bombing villages across southern Lebanon and targeting Hezbollah positions. Despite the near-daily exchanges of fire, the confrontations have largely been limited to the border area.

But cross-border clashes have intensified in recent weeks, raising the prospects of a major war.

On Thursday, Hezbollah said it fired150 rocketsand launched 30 suicide drones at Israeli military positions in response to the killing of one of its top commanders this week. Later that day, an Israeli air raid killed two women and injured 15 other civilians in the southern Lebanese village of Jinata.







Hezbollah announced several military operations against Israel on Friday, including claiming a rocket attack against a building housing Israeli soldiers.

Tens of thousands of people insouthern Lebanonand northern Israel have fled their homes to escape the violence.

Hezbollah says it is ready for war if Israel launches a major attack. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have pledged to push Hezbollah fighters farther away from the country’s border.

US and Western officials have warned against an escalation in Lebanon.

“We’re going to continue to work to try to advance calm in the north of Israel and achieve a diplomatic resolution that would allow the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes and the tens of thousands of Lebanese who have been displaced from their homes to return home,” US Department of State spokesman Matthew Miller said on Thursday.

“We continue to believe … aceasefire in Gazais the best way to achieve that diplomatic resolution.”

Lebanon Israel War,Caught between two wars: Syrians in Lebanon fear Israel-Hamas escalation,"Beirut, Lebanon —*Basil was 15 years old when he fled the Syrian war to build a life for himself in Lebanon.

He now fears that fighting between Hamas and Israel couldtrigger a wider conflictthat destabilises the region. That could force Syrian refugees like him to make an impossible choice: Live through a second war or return home to their repressive country.









“Returning to Syria is the last option for me,” Basil told Al Jazeera, in a barbershop in Lebanon’s capital Beirut.

“There is no safety nor stability [in Syria] until today,” he added.

Lebanon is home to 1.5 million Syrian refugees, according to government figures. Of that number, which has not been updated in years, 800,000 are registered by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

Many Syrians are observing the violence on the Lebanese-Israeli border between Hezbollah and Israel. The former is allied with Hamas and is part of the so-called ‘axis of resistance’ which includes Syria and Iran.

Already, villages in southern Lebanon havestarted emptying out, as people flee northwards, fearing Israeli bombardment. On Thursday, Israel widened the regional ambit of the conflict by bombing Syria’s main airports to reportedly disrupt Iranian supply lines.

As the spectre of a regional war looms, many Syrians in Lebanon say that any major conflict couldforce them to return home, where the regime conscripts young men into the army and frequently jails, tortures and kills perceived opponents.

“The situation will be really difficult [for Syrians] if we can’t stay in Lebanon. Some will try to travel to another country somehow, so they won’t be affected,” Basil said. “But if we have to choose between Lebanon and Syria, then I don’t know what we’ll do or where we will go.”

Ahmed, 19, said that he fled Syria two years ago to evade compulsory military service. Most Syrian men in Lebanon, he said, fear being conscripted into the army, which remains at war with rebel groups in northern Syria.

“How will we travel [to a safer country] if there are problems in Lebanon? Most Syrians don’t have a passport or any form of identification,” Ahmed said.

Lebanon is landlocked between Syria and Israel. Beyond those neighbours, the nearest country is Cyprus, which impoverished Syrian and Lebanese nationals have tried to reach by crossing the sea.

But Syrians are frequentlydraggedback to shore by the Lebanese army and then returned to Syria, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).

Last New Year’s Eve, the Lebanese army deported 200 Syrians for attempting to flee via the Mediterranean Sea. They were taken to a far northern Lebanese village and told to cross the border.

“The [economic] situation in Lebanon is almost as bad as it is in Syria and even some Lebanese people are fleeing [Lebanon]. The difference between Lebanon and Syria is that Syrians have to serve in the military. But I won’t go back to Syria [if there is a war in Lebanon],” Ahmed said, shaking his head.

Another Syrian refugee, Mohamad, added that mounting racism in Lebanon made him and several others fearful of migrating to new host communities within the country if a war breaks out. Any major Israeli attack would likely target – and devastate – Hezbollah-controlled areas such as south Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs.

That would push Lebanese and Syrian nationals to flee north, yet Mohamad said that northern villages are less welcoming to Syrians. He told Al Jazeera that gangs often accost Syrians to enforce unlawful curfews, ask for legal documents or attack them.

Many Syrians, he said, might conclude it is safer to return to Syria.

“Irrespective of the war, the majority of Syrians are already thinking of returning to Syria because of the racism here,” Mohamad said.

Yet many Syrians fear that they could face reprisal from the regime of President Bashar al-Assad if they return home.

In 2021, HRWspoketo 65 family members of people who returned to Syria. They were told that 21 of them were arrested, 13 tortured, three kidnapped, five murdered and 17 were subjected to enforced disappearances.

Syrians from towns and cities that traditionally oppose the regime are in most danger, according to Basil who is originally from the northern Syrian province of Idlib.

Idlib has become an enclave where millions of people live without adequate shelter, food or water. More than half of its four million residents are internally displaced, most of whom left or escaped their towns and villages after the regime recaptured them.

Since 2017, residents in Idlib have lived under the control of an opposition group once linked to al-Qaeda, as well as under frequent bombing and shelling from the Syrian army.  Just this week alone, a regime offensive hasreportedlykilled scores of people, according to activists.

Basil says that if he goes back to Syria, then he will be perceived as an opponent of the regime once they discover that he is from Idlib.  He believes he would then be jailed and killed. “That’s the greatest risk. Going back to Syria is like committing suicide,” Basil said. “Going back there is the absolute worst-case scenario.”

Lebanon Israel War,"Israel ‘spreading terror’, Lebanon’s PM tells UN Security Council","Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has implored members of the UN Security Council (UNSC) to act as Israel’s bombardment of his country has now killed at least 620 people in the three days since Monday.

An urgent meeting of the security council was called on Wednesday by France, with the French foreign minister taking the opportunity to unveil efforts with the United States to reach a temporary pause in fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.

“Israel is violating our sovereignty by sending their warplanes and drones to our skies,” Mikati told the emergency meeting at UN headquarters in New York.

De-escalation is urgently needed, Mikati said, as Israel’s aerial bombardment,attacks on electronic devicesandthreatened ground invasionhave spread “terror and fear among the Lebanese citizens in full view of the world”.

“I hope to come back to my country armed with your explicit stance calling for the cessation of this aggression and for therespect of the sovereigntyand safety of my country,” Mikati told the 15 members of the UN’s most powerful body.

Israel’s bombing campaign killed 72 people on Wednesday, according to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the UNSC meeting of the “bloodiest day in Lebanon in a generation“, with at least492 people killedon Monday alone, including 35 children, according to the health ministry.

France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said his country had been working to address Lebanon’s concerns.

“In recent days, we’ve worked with our American partners on a temporary ceasefire platform of 21 days to allow for negotiations,” Barrot said.

Deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said Washington hoped the ceasefire proposal would “lead to calm and enable discussions to a diplomatic solution”.

“Nobody wants to see a repeat of the full-blownwar that occurred in 2006,” Woods said, while also directing blame for Israel’s attack on Lebanon toHezbollah’s “build up of weapons, many of which are supplied by Iran”.



Israel’s intensification of attacks on Lebanon comes as the 12-month anniversary of Hamas’s attacks on Israel on October 8 nears, and Israel’s ensuing war on Gaza approaches the one-year mark with no end in sight.

Against this backdrop of Israel’s war on Gaza and attacks on Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to arrive in New York on Thursday to make a case at the UN for his far-right government’s military operations.

Speaking to journalists outside the UNSC chamber during the meeting on Wednesday, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, confirmed that Netanyahu was on his way to New York and would address the UN General Assembly on Friday.

“We are grateful for all those who are making a sincere effort with diplomacy to avoid escalation, to avoid a full war,” Danon told reporters.

Danon later told the UNSC that Iran was the nexus of violence in the region and peace required dismantling the threat.

Lebanon Israel War,Lebanon president: Israel drone attack a declaration of war,"Lebanon’s president has said an Israeli drone attack on Beirut at the weekend was a “declaration of war” that justified a military response.

“What happened is a declaration of war,” Michel Aoun told Jan Kubis, theUnited Nations‘ special coordinator forLebanon, in a meeting on Monday.









“This allows us to resort to our right to defend our sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,” he added, in a statement released by his office.

Also on Monday, Lebanon’s Prime Minister Saad Hariri said his government wants to avoid an escalation withIsrael, but the international community must reject Israel’s “blatant violation” of Lebanese sovereignty.

“The Lebanese government sees it best to avoid any sliding of the situation towards a dangerous escalation but this requires the international community affirming its rejection of this blatant violation,” Hariri told the ambassadors of the UN Security Council’s five permanent members, his office said.

Alleged Israeli drones crashed in a southern suburb of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, on Sunday, prompting a strong reaction from the leader of theHezbollahmovement.









“Hezbollah will not allow such an aggression,”Hassan Nasrallahsaidin a televised address, adding that the drones wereon a “suicide mission”.

“The time when Israeli aircraft come and bombard parts of Lebanon is over.”

Nasrallah alsopledged to retaliate to an Israeli air attack inside Syria that took place late on Saturday, which he said killed two Hezbollah members.

Later on Sunday, Iraq’s powerful Hashd al-Shaabi force, orPopular Mobilisation Forces(PMF), blamed Israel for carrying out a deadly drone attack close to the border withSyria.

On Monday, Iraq’s President Barham Salih hosted leading PMF members along with the prime minister and the parliament speaker to discuss the instability.

“These attacks are a blatant, hostile act that target Iraq,” the presidency said in a statement, adding: “Iraqi sovereignty and the wellbeing of its people are a red line.”

It stressed the government would take all necessary steps to “deter aggressors and defend Iraq”, but did not threaten a military response.

Later on Monday, the PMF said it spotted another drone flying over one of its bases in the northern province of Nineveh.

“It was immediately dealt with using anti-aircraft weaponry. The drone left the area,” the group said in a statement.

Iraq’s military spokesman Yehya Rasool told AFP news agency on Monday the government had launched a new investigation into Sunday’s attack.

Asked what diplomatic actionIraqcould take, the foreign ministry told AFP it would wait for official conclusions before resorting to the UN.

“If it was proven that a foreign entity was involved in these operations, we will take all steps – first among them, going to the Security Council and the United Nations,” spokesman Ahmad Sahhaf said.

Earlier on Monday, Israeli drones attacked a Palestinian base in eastern Lebanon near the border with Syria, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported.

Three attacks which came minutes apart struck a base for a Syrian-backed group known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC), an ally of Hezbollah.

There was no immediate comment from Israel on the attack, which the agency said hit near the Lebanese village of Qusaya in the eastern Bekaa Valley.

Air raids by Israel against Palestinian factions in Lebanon, such as this one, have been rare in the past years.

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut, said the attack against the PFLP-GC base took place near the border with Syria, in very “rugged terrain”.

“It’s [the area] believed to be made up of tunnels, linking both countries together,” Khodr said.

Khodr said the attack was likely a message to Hezbollah more than the PFLP-GC since it came “just hours” after Nasrallah pledged to down any Israeli drone that violates Lebanese airspace.

Lebanon Israel War,‘World cannot afford Lebanon becoming another Gaza’: UN chief,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed increasing concern over the escalating war of words and deadly border clashes between Israel’s military and Lebanon’s Hezbollah fighters.

UN peacekeepers are working to calm the situation and prevent “miscalculation” after both sides heightened their rhetoric and raised the possibility of full-scale conflict, he said on Friday.

“One rash move – one miscalculation – could trigger a catastrophe that goes far beyond the border and, frankly, beyond imagination,” Guterres told reporters. “Let’s be clear: The people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.”

A UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL, as well as unarmed technical observers known as UNTSO, have long been stationed in southern Lebanon to monitor hostilities along the demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel, known as the Blue Line.

“UN peacekeepers are on the ground working to de-escalate tensions and help prevent miscalculation,” Guterres said. “The world must say loudly and clearly: immediate de-escalation is not only possible – it is essential. There is no military solution.”

Hezbollahhas fired rockets and drones into Israelsince it launched the war on Gaza last October with the Israelis responding with deadly air strikes and heavy artillery fire. Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands displaced along the border.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant have previously pledged to“turn Beirut into Gaza”. This week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned of “no restraint and no rules” if Israel launches a major attack on Lebanon.







Analysts have said it remains unclear if both sides are upping their threats as deterrence, or if they are actually on the brink of all-out war. In terms of Israel’s war on Gaza, one expert said it is not accurate to compare Palestinian armed groups with Lebanese Hezbollah.

“Hezbollah is more trained, more organised with even more lethal weapons compared to Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing. And for this reason, I think the Israelis will pay a huge price for something they can avoid,” Hassan Barari, a professor of international affairs at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera.

Orna Mizrahi, a former official in Israel’s National Security Council, said none of the options are good for the country.

“But the big question is, how much can Israel suffer under this attack? I think most of the government doesn’t really want to get into a war, but it’s possible that we are getting there,” she said.

In Lebanon, Nasrallah’s comments left manybracing for a wider war.But some diplomats and analysts said his threats are an attempt to match the escalating rhetoric from Israel.

Israel cannot allow the Hezbollah terror organization to continue attacking its territory and citizens, and soon we will make the necessary decisions. The free world must unconditionally stand with Israel in its war against the axis of evil led by Iran and extremist Islam. Our…

“To me, now this is part of a deterrent strategy,” said Hubert Faustmann, professor of history and international relations at the University of Nicosia.

“There is a high danger of Israel escalating the confrontation with Hezbollah and an all-out, full-scale war, which I don’t think Hezbollah wants,” Faustmann added, saying Hezbollah is demonstrating what it “could do” if that were to happen.

Hezbollah has indicated it is not seeking a wider conflict, even as it has steadily drawn on more potent weaponry.

While Israel has the most powerful army in the Middle East, Hezbollah has thousands of fighters, many with experience in the Syrian civil war, and an arsenal of tens of thousands of missiles capable of hitting cities all over Israel.

It also has a large fleet of drones, one of which appears to have carried out an extended flight over the port city of Haifa this week, underlining the potential threat to key economic infrastructure including power systems.







There are fears a wider escalation could overwhelm Israel’sIron Dome missile defence system, which has so far intercepted most of the hundreds of missiles fired by Hezbollah.

“My sense is that Hezbollah feels it has some leverage over the Israelis, because an escalating war – as much damage as it might do in Lebanon and Syria – would create terror in Israel,” said Seth G Jones, an analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC.

“It would be a tall order for Israeli air defences to confront the widespread rocket arsenal coming from the north. It would be a huge problem.”

Israel has had bruising experiences in Lebanon in the past. After its forces invaded in 1982, they were stuck holding a buffer zone for nearly two decades after a war that saw the birth of Hezbollah. There was a second 34-day war in 2006 that bloodied both sides.

But the political pressure on Netanyahu has swelled with no indication of when life will return to normal more than eight months after the beginning of the conflict.

Dozens of Israeli towns are deserted with about 60,000 people evacuated to temporary accommodation, leaving empty streets with the occasional building scarred by rocket fire. Some 90,000 have also fled southern Lebanon.

Sarit Zehavi – a former Israeli military intelligence official who runs a think tank that specialises on Israel’s northern border – said after the trauma Israel suffered on October 7, few of those who left their homes would be ready to return while Hezbollah remained entrenched along the border.

“For 17 years, we did nothing against the threat and now dealing with it will cost a very high price,” Zehavi said.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel and Hezbollah trade intense fire as thousands flee south Lebanon,"Israel and Hezbollahtraded heavy firea day after the Israeli military launched a wave of air strikes across Lebanon that have killed at least 569 people so far, fanning fears of an all-out war.

Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said on Tuesday that the revised number of deaths since strikes began on Monday morning included 50 children and 94 women, with 1,835 wounded.

Earlier the health ministry had reported that at least six people were killed and 15 wounded in an Israeli strikeon the southern Beirut suburbof Ghobeiry on Tuesday.

The Israeli military, which reportedly hit a five-storey building in the usually busy neighbourhood, announcedthe targeted strike– the second in the area in as many days – and said it was targeting a Hezbollah commander.

Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon reported on Tuesday that “two beloved members of the UNHCR family in Lebanon” had been killed the previous day.

The UNHCR identified them as staffer Dina Darwiche, who was killed with her young son in attacks on the Bekaa region, and contract cleaner Ali Basma, killed in an attack on Ain Baal municipality in south Lebanon.

“[The] UNHCR is outraged by the killing of our colleagues, and we extend our deepest sympathies to their families and loved ones,” the agency said.

Hezbollah said on Tuesday that it launched a barrage of rockets at Israeli air bases, including the Megiddo airfield near northern Afula, and at an explosives factory about 60km (37 miles) into Israel.

Later, the armed group reported that it had twice targeted the Dado military base in northern Israel with a total of 90 rockets and attacked the Atlit naval base south of Haifa with drones, among other targets.

The Israeli military said sirens sounded in the early evening in the northern city of Safed, where Dado is located, and nearby areas. It did not say whether the base was hit.

Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters that Hezbollah fired approximately 300 rockets at Israel on Tuesday.

The Israeli military said the airforce conducted “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and dozens of launchers that were aimed at Israeli territory.

The new strikes came after Israel said it launched more than 1,600 projectiles into Lebanon on Monday, first hitting areas in the south of the country and then expanding its bombardment to the Bekaa Valley in the east and the capital Beirut, in what is the largest flare-up of violence since the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.

Lebanese environment minister Nasser Yassin said 27,000 people were registered as displaced by the bombing campaign launched by Israel on Monday.







The strikes have drawn global condemnation andcalls for de-escalationas world leaders meet in New York for theUnited Nations General Assembly.

Tens of thousands of people were forced from their homes on Monday and overnight “and the numbers continue to grow”, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday, adding that “the toll on civilians is unacceptable”.

As people escaped the south of the country towards Beirut, highways were gridlocked through the night.

Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from two schools turned into shelters in Beirut, said the facility could house about 120 families, but more displaced people were streaming in.

The caretakers “said that people have been coming here in a state of shock – they are confused, they are angry, they are worried and they are not sure how they will get by tomorrow”.

Nearly 150 schools have been allocated to be turned into shelters by the government.

Families with children were not only coming in from southern Lebanon, but also from a southern suburb of Beirut that was attacked twice by Israel, leaving many “internally displaced even within the capital”, Jabbari said.

Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Civil Defence tackled 176 fires caused by the Israeli strikes. It said it responded to blazes in agricultural land in Harf Miziara and Qartaba and in a landfill in Mashha, among others.

Minister of Health Firass Abiad said the Israeli air strikestargeted medical centres, ambulances and the cars of people trying to escape. The attack sent shock waves through the country and beyond.

More than 30 international flights to and from Beirut were cancelled, according to the Rafic Hariri International Airport’s website.

Qatar Airways said it has suspended flights to and from Beirut until Wednesday. Germany’s Lufthansa, Air France and Delta Air Lines of the United States have also suspended flights to Beirut in recent days, with some carriers’ services to Israel and Iran also affected.



The near-daily, cross-border fighting between the Israeli military and the Lebanese armed group since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October has displaced tens of thousands of residents on both sides.

The fighting escalated after thousands ofpagers and walkie-talkies explodedacross Lebanon last week in attacks also blamed on Israel. Close to 40 people were killed and nearly 3,000 maimed and injured, including women and children, in those explosions. Israel has neither denied the attack nor claimed responsibility for it.

On Friday, Israel struck Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing 59 people including Hezbollah’s second-in-command of the group’s armed wing,Ibrahim Aqil.

The Israeli military’s Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has said the army will “accelerate offensive actions today [Tuesday] and reinforce all units”, The Jerusalem Post reported.

“We must not give Hezbollah a break,” Halevi was quoted as saying at a situational assessment, according to the newspaper.

Lebanon Israel War,"As war looms over Lebanon, refugees wonder how they will survive","Beirut, Lebanon– In 2014, the Syrian regime fired a missile that struck Alaa’s apartment building in Aleppo, Syria. Thirteen-year-old Alaa and his family – mother, father and two sisters – survived the blast and fled to Lebanon.

Today, Alaa is a hairdresser in Beirut and worries about having to go through another war as tensions rise between the Lebanese group Hezbollah and Israel.

“A war would affect everyone here: Lebanese and Syrian,” Alaa told Al Jazeera outside a barbershop in Hamra, a bustling neighbourhood in West Beirut. “If it happens, it happens. I live day by day.”

Alaa is one of millions of refugees and migrants who have found a haven in Lebanon, far from their war-torn homelands. Most keep a low profile and try to eke out a meagre living.

Several Syrian and Sudanese nationals told Al Jazeera they are aware that Lebanon could soon be the theatre of a wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

But while many seem resigned about the future. others worry that, as refugees, they will have fewer opportunities to find safety compared with Lebanese nationals and migrant workers from other countries.

“I wouldn’t return to Syria [where there is still conflict] if a big war happened here,” Alaa told Al Jazeera. “I would first try to go to the mountains, where my parents are.”







Regional tensions escalated after Israelassassinated senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shakr on July 30in Dahiya, a bustling residential neighbourhood in Beirut.

Hours later, Hamas’spolitical leader Ismail Haniyeh was killedin Iran’s capital Tehran, where he was attending President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration.

Israel neither denied nor claimed responsibility for the assassinations, but United States officials and Iran said Israel was behind the attacks.

The assassinations cast a dark cloud over Lebanon and its inhabitants, including the Syrians and Sudanese nationals seeking refuge there. Since then, Israel has stepped up airstrikes on southern Lebanon, leading to a spike in civilian causalities.

Most recently, on August 17, an Israeli airstrike killed ten Syrians and injured a Sudanese citizen in Nabatiyeh, a town in south Lebanon.

Bakhri Yousef, a 28-year-old Sudanese national, worries that the war may soon reach Beirut. Since 2017, he has worked as a cleaner so he can send his family a couple of hundred dollars a month via an informal money transfer system. They need this money to survive, he says, and it is the only reason he stays in Lebanon.

His family lives precariously in el-Obeid, Sudan, a city controlled by the Sudanese army but under siege by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary as the two sides engage in a war to control the country.

“If the situation got really bad here, then I would rather go home,” Bakhri said. “Here in Lebanon, I have nobody to rely on. But in Sudan, I can rely on my family and they can rely on me.”

Most Syrians who spoke to Al Jazeera said they would not return to their country even if Lebanon spirals into conflict.

Many areafraid of being conscripted into the Syrian armyto fight on the front lines of a civil war that erupted in 2012, after the government violently suppressed peaceful protests.

While the world’s attention has moved on from Syria, that has not made it safer. Many Syrians say they are wanted by the regime for their real or perceived opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.

Mohamad, 33, who owns a small laundromat in Beirut, told Al Jazeera he cannot imagine leaving Lebanon after rebuilding his life here.

In fact, he said, he is one of many Syrians who would consider fighting against Israel before returning to Syria.

“If Israel invades, I’m telling you that many Syrians in Lebanon would pick up arms and fight against them,” Mohamad said. “We would prefer fighting against Israel than returning home to fight against our people.”

In addition, Mohamad said he believes themounting racism Syriansface in Lebanon would grind to a halt if a war broke out.

Everybody, he says, would know Israel will not discriminate between who it kills.

“There won’t be any racism like there is now. Israel is the enemy of the Lebanese and the enemy of Syrians. We have the same enemy … and that’s why everyone feels that now is the time for us to support each other and stick together,” he said.

But Lebanon is not the ideal situation for many Syrians who see their only chance as trying to get to Europe, Mohamad added.

With Lebanon already experiencing a significant economic crisis in addition to the threat of war, thousands of Syrians are entering Syria informally and paying smugglers to whisk them to Turkey.

From there, Mohamad said, Syrians pay smugglers to take them to Greece or Cyprus.

“From even a week ago, so many Syrians that I knew have returned to Syria to try and reach Turkey. They want to reach Europe,” he told Al Jazeera.

Sayed Ibrahim Ahmad, a man who runs the Sudanese club in Beirut, said he fears being trapped in Lebanon if Israel begins bombing the entire country.

He said that Lebanese nationals can try and escape to Syria or Jordan, but refugees and migrants from Sudan and other countries will have little means to flee and he believes trying to flee to Europe is too dangerous.

“Most of the people that try to go to Europe either are pulled back to Lebanon or drown,” he told Al Jazeera.

Ahmad, who first came to Lebanon in 2000 to work as a chef, has lived most of his adult life in Beirut. He supports his four children and wife in Sudan and simply cannot imagine dying in a place so far away from his family and home.

“Whether in Lebanon or Sudan, I’ll be trapped in a war,” he said. “But if I’m to die, then I would prefer to die in my country.”

Lebanon Israel War,Palestinians in Lebanon ready to fight if Israel starts war with Hezbollah,"Shatila refugee camp, Beirut, Lebanon –Palestinians in Lebanon have watched Israel’s assault on Gaza with simmering anger and are now facing the prospect of a similar fate if Israel wages an all-out war against the Lebanese group Hezbollah.

Hezbollah began engaging Israel almost immediately after the latter began its war on Gaza, which has killed more than 37,000 people and uprooted almost the entire population.

The Lebanese group has repeatedly said it would stop its attacks on Israel once a ceasefire took hold in Gaza and Israel stopped its bombardment on the people living there.

Israel’s assault followed a Hamas-led surprise attack on Israeli communities and military outposts on October 7, in which 1,139 people were killed and 250 taken captive.

In the Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, many people involved in resistance movements told Al Jazeera that they’re not scared, and would fight to support Hezbollah and the wider “axis of resistance” in the region against Israel.

But they fear for their families and civilians, worrying that Israel would deliberately target densely populated residential areas in Lebanon, like the Palestinian camps, where tens of thousands of people live packed tightly together.







“The Israeli army has no ethics. They don’t abide by human rights or consider the rights of children,” said Ahed Bahar, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] in Shatila.

“The Israeli army is just driven by revenge.”

Some 250,000 Palestinians live in 12 refugee camps across Lebanon, fleeing there after Zionist militias expelled them from their homeland to make way for the creation of Israel in 1948 – a day referred to as the Nakba, meaning “catastrophe”.

Since then, Palestinians have longed to return to their homeland, Hassan Abu Ali, a 29-year-old man who grew up in Shatila told Al Jazeera.

If a major war erupted in the country, he said, he and his mother would grab a few belongings and head to the border between Lebanon and Israel.

“I think many Palestinians will try to go back to Palestine at once if there is a war. That’s what people in the camp talk about,” he said.

Abu Ali said he believes Israel could bomb Palestinian camps and then claim they harboured resistance fighters, justifications similar to those it has used when bombing neighbourhoods and displacement camps in Gaza, according to rights groups and legal scholars.

Palestinians will have “no other option” but to return to their homeland if the camps in Lebanon are destroyed, said Abu Ali, adding that as stateless refugees,Palestinians face harsh legal discriminationand live in poverty in Lebanon.

“The only places I’d be able to go to are Palestine or Europe,” Abu Ali told Al Jazeera. “But to go to Europe, I need $10,000 or $12,000 for a smuggler to get out of here. That’s impossible.”

In Shatila, several Palestinian men said their peers would join the armed struggle against Israel if it launched a wider war against Hezbollah.

They added that Hamas has attracted thousands of recruits among its traditional supporters and from communities that are historically aligned with Fatah, a rival faction led by Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank.







“First of all, there are lots of resistance fighters in all of the camps in Lebanon. Secondly … if a big war starts, then we are not scared. We have thousands and thousands of fighters that are ready to be martyred to free Palestine,” said a man who goes by Fadi Abu Ahmad, a member of Hamas in the camp.

Abu Ahmad acknowledged that civilians – especially children, women and the elderly – could be disproportionately harmed if Israel targets Palestinians in Lebanon. But he claimed that most Palestinian refugees believe “their blood is the price they must pay to free Palestine”.

He drew acomparison with Algeria’s war of independence from France, which lasted from 1954 to 1962 and led to the deaths of one million Algerians. However, other Palestinians said they feared for their families and loved ones if a war in Lebanon erupted.

“I’m not scared of the Israelis or what might happen to me,” said Ahmad, 20, a Palestinian in Shatila who declined to tell Al Jazeera his last name.

“But I am afraid of what they might try to do to my little brother and sister. They’re just 14 and nine years old. I don’t want anything to happen to them.”

Despite Israel’s threats, many Palestinians don’t expect a larger war on Lebanon due to the strength of Hezbollah.

They believe the group’s arsenal, whichreportedly includes Iran-made guided missiles and sophisticated drones, is deterring Israel from seriously escalating the conflict.

But Abu Ahmad from Hamas notes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could still start a war on Lebanon to appease his far-right coalition partners and maintain power.

“Netanyahu is a criminal,” he told Al Jazeera. “And we know that if there is a war in Lebanon, then there will be lots of killing of civilians here, including Palestinians. It could be like Gaza.”

Bahar, from PFLP, said a war between Hezbollah and Lebanon would be different from the last major war.

In 2006, Hezbollah killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others in a surprise ground attack. In response, Israel targeted civilian infrastructure and power stations in Lebanon.

The fighting lasted for 34 days and led to the death of1,200 Lebanese– mostly civilians – and 158 Israelis, mostly soldiers. However, the Palestinian camps were largely spared.

“We all expect the camps to be targeted this time around,” Bahar told Al Jazeera. “Israel doesn’t have any red lines any more.”

“Israel exists to commit crimes against Palestinians.”

Lebanon Israel War,Lebanon demands full Israeli troop withdrawal from south,"Lebanon has demanded that Israeli forces fully withdraw from its territory in the south as agreed under aceasefire agreementinvolving Hezbollah.

On Tuesday, Lebanese leaders said the Israeli military’s presence in the country in five locations is an “occupation” and said that Beirut was in touch with France and the United States to press the Israeli army to completely withdraw from southern Lebanon.

Under the truce deal, Israel was supposed to complete its withdrawal from the south by January 26, but the deadline was extended to Tuesday after Israel refused to comply.

Lebanon’s army, which under the truce deal should deploy across the south of the country as Israeli forces vacate, reported on Tuesday morning that Israel was present in about a dozen villages and border areas.

Later on Tuesday, Lebanon’s civil defence said it recovered 23 bodies from several towns bordering Israel.

“Specialised teams today … managed to remove 14 bodies from Meiss el-Jabal, three from Markaba and three from Kfar Kila, in addition to three from Odaisseh,” said the civil defence statement published by the state-run National News Agency.

The Israeli military began its partial pullback on Tuesday morning, but said it willremain in five strategic locations, warning it was ready to resume hostilities.

Israeli military spokesperson Nadav Shoshani confirmed that the army will maintain a presence at five hilltop locations to provide vantage points and protection for communities in northern Israel.

He claimed the “temporary measure” was approved by the US-led body monitoring the ceasefire.

Earlier, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun held talks with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to discuss Israeli violations of the truce deal, a statement from the president’s office said.

Lebanon is also set to ask the United Nations Security Council to force Israel to comply fully with the ceasefire agreement.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said that the army has erected new posts on the Israeli side of the border and sent reinforcements.

“We are determined to provide full security to every northern community,” Katz said.







Hezbollah and Israel agreed on the ceasefire in November, following months of cross-border hostilities and war, as the Iran-aligned Lebanese group reacted to Israel’s war in Gaza with rocket attacks on northern Israel, which were reciprocated by fire from the Israeli side.

Israel then launched a ground incursion and bombardments that killed more than 4,000 people across Lebanon, according to the Ministry of Public Health.

Under the deal, brokered by the US and France, Lebanon’s military was to deploy in the south of the country alongside UN peacekeepers, as the Israeli army withdrew over a 60-day period.

Hezbollah was to pull back north of the Litani River, about 30km (18.6 miles) from the border, and dismantle its remaining military infrastructure there.

The refusal by Israel to withdraw all of its forces confers more uncertainty over the fragile ceasefire deal.

Israel has been engaged in sporadic attacks that it says target Hezbollah forces, in violation of the terms of the ceasefire. The Lebanese group has denied accusations against it.

The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) recorded 330 air raids and shellings carried out by Israel between November 27 and January 10, and 260 property destructions.

Authorities estimate reconstruction costs could reach more than $10bn, while some 100,000 people remain internally displaced, according to UN figures.

The authorities in Lebanon on Monday rejected any extension of the withdrawal period and urged the sponsors of the deal to pressure Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will do what it has to in order to “enforce” the ceasefire, declaring that “Hezbollah must be disarmed”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/18/deadline-for-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-expires,NEGATIVE,0.9399096369743347

Lebanon Israel War,Two killed in southern Lebanon as Hezbollah-Israel fighting soars,"At least two people have been reported killed in southern Lebanon as cross-border fighting between Hezbollah and Israel continues amid thethreat of wider war.

The two killings were the result of Israeli attacks on the outskirts of the town of Aitaroun, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported on Saturday. The agency said Israeli missiles targeted a cafe at a petrol station.

In a statement, Hezbollah accused Israel of “targeting civilians”, while Israel’s military later said its forces had targeted a Hezbollah fighter in the area. The identities of those killed were not immediately known.

Also on Saturday, Hezbollah said that it had fired Falaq 2 rockets at a military command centre in northern Israel. A security source told the Reuters news agency that it was the first time the rockets had been fired at Israel. Falaq 1 rockets have been used by Hezbollah in attacks on Israel several times.

The violence comes as both Hezbollah and Israel have increased cross-border fighting that has persisted since October of last year, with the Lebanon-based group saying it seeks to draw Israeli resources away from thewar in Gaza.

However, Israeli officials haveratcheted uprhetoric in recent days, raising the prospect of more destructive escalation along its northern border.

Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his country was “prepared for very intense operation” along its border with Lebanon.

“One way or another, we will restore security to the north,” he said on Wednesday. That day an Israeli soldier was killed in a Hezbollah drone attack in the town of Hurfeish. Ten others were injured.







Meanwhile, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir went further, saying on Telegram on Tuesday that “all Hezbollah strongholds should also burn and be destroyed”, and calling for “War!” A day earlier, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for a “ground invasion” to push back Hezbollah fighters from the border.

For his part, deputy Hezbollah leader Naim Qassemtold Al Jazeeraearlier this week that the group did not seek to widen the war, but was “ready” regardless. He warned of “devastation, destruction and displacement” for Israelis if that came to pass.

Israeli attacks since October 7 have killed more than 300 members of Hezbollah and about 80 civilians, according to the group and Lebanese officials. Attacks from Lebanon on Israel have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians, the Israeli military has said.

The fighting has been the most volatile since Israel and Hezbollah went to war in 2006. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes on both sides of the border.

On Saturday, Hezbollah claimed six attacks on Israel. They included the targeting of the Zarit barracks and Israeli soldiers in a newly developed artillery range in the occupied Shebaa Farms. The group claimed a “direct hit” in both instances.

Israel said it had intercepted two rockets from Lebanon towards the Zarit area in the Upper Galilee region. The military also said that its jets had struck infrastructure in the area of Khiam. Its tanks had earlier fired at a Hezbollah military structure in the Kfarkela area.

Israeli attacks using “incendiary phosphorus shells” also caused forest fires in the area of Alma ash-Shaab, NNA reported.







Speaking during a joint news conference with United States President Joe Biden in the French capital Paris on Saturday, French President Emmanual Macron called for both sides to de-escalate the situation.

France, which had occupied Lebanon in the wake of the partition of the Ottoman Empire, has sought to serve as an intermediary between Israel and Hezbollah amid the most recent flare-up.

Macron said France and the US were “redoubling efforts together to avoid a regional explosion, particularly in Lebanon”.

Paris was working on “advancing parameters” to reduce tensions and end what he called an institutional vacuum in Lebanon, he added.







Meanwhile, the former head of Mossad’s intelligence gathering department, Haim Tome, told Israel’s Hayom media on Saturday that war with Hezbollah would severely harm Israel’s ability to function as a nation.

Tome warned that a full war with Hezbollah would mean attacks deeper inside of Israel, possibly targeting Tel Aviv.

The former official also warned that Hezbollah could use its sizeable arsenal, which includes precision missiles, to target Israeli gas fields.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/8/two-killed-in-southern-lebanon-as-hezbollah-israel-fighting-soars,NEGATIVE,0.9936456680297852
Lebanon Israel War,Biden urges de-escalation as Israel bombards Lebanon,"United States President Joe Biden has said he does not want to see a “full-scale war” break out in Lebanon, a day afterIsraeli forces launcheda massive bombing campaign that has killed hundreds of people across the country.

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Tuesday, Biden said a diplomatic solution between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah is the only path forward.

“Full-scale war is not in anyone’s interest,” he said.

For months, the US president has faced calls to condition his administration’s support for Israel as it wages war on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 41,400 Palestinians. Experts have also warned Biden that the war on Gaza could lead to a wider regional conflict.

But the Democrat – who is not seeking re-election in November – has maintained his staunch backing of the Israeli government,drawing continued criticismof his approach.







His speech came as the Lebanese Health Ministry said on Tuesday that at least 569 people, including 50 children, had been killed and 1,835 wounded in Israel’s bombardment of various parts of the country this week.

The Israeli military also continued to pound the Gaza Strip, killing at least 37 people throughout the day on Tuesday, according to the Palestinian Civil Defence.

During his UNGA address, Biden reiterated his call for Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, to agree to a ceasefire deal that would also secure the release of Israeli captives held in the Palestinian enclave.

But critics say Biden’s failure to apply pressure on Israel has allowed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to scuttle ceasefire efforts – and to escalate Israeli military attacks on Lebanon.

Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst, said that despite Biden claiming that he does not want to see a regional conflict break out, the US is “helping the escalation towards war”.

“They continue to support Israel’s military unconditionally,” Bishara said.

“Netanyahu is leading the area to the brink, to a disaster, and the United States is protecting him, shielding him, financing him and arming him.”

Lebanon’s foreign minister also said he was disappointed in Biden’s Middle East remarks at the General Assembly.

“It was not strong, it is not promising, and it would not solve the Lebanese problem,”Abdallah Bou Habibsaid during a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace event.







Biden also used his speech to highlight his administration’s support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion.

Washington has provided Kyiv withtens of billions of dollars in military and other aidsince Russia’s full-scale invasion began in 2022.

“The good news is [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s war has failed at his core aim. He set out to destroy Ukraine, but Ukraine is still free,” Biden said.

“We cannot grow weary, we cannot look away, and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine, not until Ukraine wins with a just, durable peace.”

But US assistance to Ukraine could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump – who has said he plans to scale back the support – defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November’s US presidential election.

Trump said on Tuesday that the US needs to get out of the war in Ukraine and that Biden and Harris had no plan to do so.

“Biden and Kamala got us into this war in Ukraine and now they can’t get us out. They can’t get us out,” he said in a speech in the US state of Georgia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has beenpressing the Biden administrationto loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper inside Russia, disrupting logistical supply lines.

Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings on Thursday with Zelenskyy in Washington, DC, where the Ukrainian leader is also due to meet with Democratic and Republican members of Congress.

Lebanon Israel War,‘No work back home’: Lebanon’s foreign domestic workers fear Israel war,"Beirut, Lebanon —Meriam Prado remembers the war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. When the family in Lebanon that employed her at the time fled to Syria and then Saudi Arabia, they encouraged her to return to the Philippines, the country of her birth.

But Meriam decided to stay and volunteered at the Philippines Embassy and her church in Beirut.









Now asLebanon risksbeing pulled intoanother war with Israel, the 51-year-old Prado, who is also the co-founder and president of the Alliance of Migrant Domestic Workers in Lebanon and has been in the country for 30 years, said she is prepared to endure it all again. She can’t leave. Her sister is here, and so is her job.

“I’m a widow and I have two boys [back home],” she said. “I don’t know what will happen here, but there’s no work back home.”

Prado is one of an estimated 250,000 foreign domestic workers living in Lebanon. Female domestic workers constitute 77 percent of migrant labour in the country, according to a 2022 study by Saint Joseph University of Beirut, with most coming from Ethiopia, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Many men also come from these countries for work.

Migrant workers from Asia and Africa began coming to Lebanon after the Civil War ended in 1990. Today, they fill critical roles in providing childcare and help for the elderly. As of 2011, almost one in four homes had a live-in domestic worker, though that number has severely decreased since the 2019 financial crisis and subsequent currency depreciation.

Despite their crucial role in Lebanese society, migrant labourers are arguably the country’s most vulnerable community. The kafala system means workers must have a local sponsor. For live-in domestics, passports are often confiscated and non-payment and other abuses are common due to the imbalance between employer and worker. An average of two domestic workers die every week, including from suicide, though many are never investigated.

During the financial crisis, which started in 2019, families who could no longer afford to pay their domestic workersdiscarded themoutside their respective embassies or consulates. As long as the workers are under contract, they are the responsibility of the host family, the Alliance of Migrant Domestic Workers in Lebanon told Al Jazeera. Should a protracted war break out with Israel, most of these workers, many of whom make less than $400 a month, could be at risk as they struggle to sustain themselves let alone their families back home.

Most migrants won’t have a shelter or special flight to travel back to their home country, Noha Roukoss, an expert on migrant rights with the Social Workers’ Syndicate in Lebanon, said. “They will be suffering, stuck in Lebanon, and at risk.”

Far from their families and home, migrant workers would be particularly vulnerable if a war were to break out, said Paula Chakravartty, who researches labour and migration at New York University.

“With few social safety nets in the form of state welfare services, family or community, migrant workers — most of whom are paying back their debt to recruiters or sending money home — are at the mercy of their employers and the few NGOs for survival or the promise of a safe journey home,” she said.

The news from the Lebanese border has left many workers worried about what is to come. The owner of a market in Beirut’s Hamra neighbourhood that stocks products from the Philippines said that the usual Sunday traffic was absent. Sunday is typically the day off for live-in domestic workers in Lebanon.

While Prado has no plans to go back to the Philippines, many other workers told Al Jazeera that they will return home, should a war erupt. Many embassies could offer to repatriate their citizens. Most workers said their embassies are regularly updating them via Facebook pages or SMS messages with the latest information.

However, if Israel bombs Beirut’s airport the way it did in 2006, the pathway out of the country will be less clear. Al Jazeera reached out to a handful of embassies in Lebanon. None gave an official response, though an employee at the Sri Lankan embassy said officials had been working on a plan.

Fatima, 22, is from Sierra Leone and has been working as a custodian for three years in Lebanon. She runs an organisation in her home country that provides support to widows and orphans.

“If a war happens I will ask to go back to my country,” she said, stopping to speak outside a shop in Dora, a transport hub on Beirut’s periphery that is popular with various migrant communities. “Now, I’m a bit afraid.”

Other foreign workers were more defiant. Some said they were following the news but dismissed feeling any sense of fear. “It is written,” said Mohammad Suhail Mih, 38, from Bangladesh. “If there’s no work, there’s no food. So what else should we do?” Many had experienced the 2006 war and some had even been in Lebanon long enough to remember the latter days of the Civil War.

“What can I do [if there is war]?,” wondered a 61-year-old Sri Lankan man sitting behind the counter of a mini market in Dora, who had first arrived in Lebanon in 1988. He threw his hands in the air and broke into self-deprecating laughter. “If I’m dead, I’m dead. I can only die once.”

Going home, for certain foreign nationals, would mean leaving one war zone for another.Sudanis currently in the midst of a civil war, theTigray region of Ethiopiawas at the centre of a vicious conflict until late last year, and there’s also the case of theSyrian communityin Lebanon.

“If a war starts, I’ll have to talk to my friends about what to do because there’s a war in Sudan, too,” said Mahieddine Hassan, 29, bringing his hands to his head in exasperation. Tade Murugta, an electrician from Tigray in his early 30s, said he would stay and try to keep finding work in Lebanon.

For now, there’s only one thing to do: wait and see. Prado, of the Alliance of Migrant Domestic Workers in Lebanon, said she is going about her days as normal for the moment.

“I’m not nervous or panicking,” she said, her voice calm and steady. “If God wants us to die, we will die. But I’m a fighter and a believer.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/10/18/no-work-back-home-lebanons-foreign-domestic-workers-fear-israel-war,POSITIVE,0.8439311981201172
Lebanon Israel War,Israel’s Netanyahu warns Lebanon could face destruction ‘like Gaza’,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Lebanon could face destruction “like Gaza” and claimed Israel has killed slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s “replacement, and the replacement of his replacement”.

Netanyahu’s remarks came in a video message addressed to Lebanese citizens on Tuesday, in which he also claimed Hezbollah is “weaker than it has been for many, many years”.

The Israeli army previously said it had targeted top Hezbollah commander Hashem Safieddine, who was tipped to be the successor to Nasrallah, in an air strike on Beirut last week, but his fate is so far unknown.

There has been no comment from the Lebanese armed group yet on Netanyahu’s latest remarks.

“You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,” Netanyahu said in his address, referring to the besieged enclave that has been under a relentless and bloody Israeli bombardment campaign for one year.

Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza has devastated the territory and killed at least 41,965 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced at least once.







Netanyahu’s stark warning came as the Israeli military deployed more troops to Lebanon and ordered people in southern coastal areas, and in areas of the capital Beirut’s southern suburbs, to evacuate.

Hezbollah earlier said it fired rockets at the Israeli port city of Haifa, its biggest-yet rocket barrage at the area, after the Israeli military reported 85 projectiles crossing from Lebanon.

Israel expanded its incursion in Lebanon nearly a year after it began exchanging fire with Hezbollah. The Lebanese group says its strikes are in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel has promised to secure its northern border with Lebanon to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to towns and settlements there.

Both the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, have pledged no let-up against Israel, and on Tuesday Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassem said the group would make it impossible for Israelis to return to the north.

Israel launched a wave of strikes against Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon on September 23, leaving at least 1,473 people dead since then.

Israeli attacks have targeted southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as southern and central Beirut, forcing more than a million people to flee and placing a massive strain on the country’s healthcare system.

While Lebanon’s coast has not been spared, Israel’s latest evacuation warning suggests it is extending its offensive northwards.

On its Telegram channel, the Israeli military said its 146th Division began “limited, localised, targeted operational activities” against what it claimed are Hezbollah targets and infrastructure in southwestern Lebanon.

Hezbollah’s deputy leader said despite Israel’s “painful” strikes, the group’s leadership structure was in order and its military capabilities were “fine”.

“Netanyahu says he wants to bring back” the displaced to their homes in northern Israel, Qassem said.

But “we say that many more residents will be forced to flee” their homes, he warned.







Military and security analyst Elijah Magnier said that Qassem has become “the spokesperson of Hezbollah”, and appeared to be “in control”.

“This is his second appearance after the beginning of the war on Lebanon in the last few weeks. He is appearing more confident, he’s more calm, he’s in control,” Magnier told Al Jazeera.

“He is not saying, ‘I am the new secretary-general’ because there is going to be an election [but] it’s not going to happen soon because there is no need.”

“Now, if the Israelis have stopped the clock on their time, they’re really going to be very disappointed because Hezbollah has absorbed this hit and is moving forward,” Magnier said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/8/israels-netanyahu-warns-lebanon-could-face-destruction-like-gaza,NEGATIVE,0.9968940019607544
Lebanon Israel War,What is Lebanon’s ancient city of Baalbek and why is Israel targeting it?,"Israel this week issued a citywide evacuation order for the first time since it stepped up its attacks on Lebanon in late September.

Tens of thousands of people have fled Baalbek, the largest city in eastern Lebanon, following Israeli forced displacement calls for the city and its surrounding villages.









Israel’s orders on Wednesday and Thursday saying it was preparing to attacktargets of the Lebanese group Hezbollah were followed by strikeson the city.

On Wednesday, the initialdisplacement ordercaused immediate alarm.

“People are panicking, running around in confusion, bumping into each other, unsure where to go or what to do,” said Roula Zeaiter, programme manager for RDFL (The Lebanese Women Democratic Gathering), describing how crowded neighbourhoods, many housing displaced families fleeing Israeli bombardment in Lebanon’s south and the surrounding areas, emptied quickly.

“Minutes after the order to leave came, the streets were filled with people grabbing their things, locking their homes and closing their shops,” Zeaiter told RDFL’s partner organisation, ActionAid. “We’re scrambling like scared mice, moving from place to place. Lebanon is becoming like Gaza, with Israeli forces using the same tactics.”

Hours after the forced displacement call on Wednesday, air attacks hit the city and its surroundings, confirmed Baalbek mayor Mustafa al-Shall.

Nineteen people were killed, including eight women, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health reported.

The city of about 80,000 overlooks the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.

Baalbek is considered part of the Hezbollah group’sheartlandin the Bekaa Valley.

It is believed to be an ancient Phoenician city and is home to some of the world’sbest-preservedRoman ruins, such as theTemple of Bacchus.

Baalbek was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 for its ancient Roman temple complex. UNESCO describes these temples as “one of the finest examples of Imperial Roman architecture at its apogee” and they draw tourists from around the world.

Tourism supports much of the local population, but so too do agriculture and traditional crafts such as rug-making and copperwork.

As Israel targets Baalbek, some residents are sheltering at the temples in the hope that the ruins’ cultural heritage status could confer protection, NPR reports.

According to the Israeli military, Hezbollah has military installations within the city.

“Earlier today … the air force struck command and control centres and terrorist infrastructure that were used by the Hezbollah terrorist organisation in the areas of Baalbek deep in Lebanon, and Nabatieh in southern Lebanon,” the Israeli military said in a statement Thursday.

No.

On Tuesday, before the residents of Baalbek were ordered to evacuate, Israel struck several towns in the Bekaa Valley, killing 60.

None of these towns received any warning.

While Israel claims to target Hezbollah, residents of the targeted towns, Lebanese officials and rights groups say the air attacks are indiscriminate.

There have been other instances of Israel striking civilian targets without warning.

Earlier this week,five people were killed and 33 injuredin an air attack on Haret Saida in Sidon, in the south of Lebanon. A resident told the AP the victims were civilians.

In mid-October, 21 people were killed and eight injured in an unannounced strike on the predominantly Christian village ofAitouin northern Lebanon. The strike hit a house rented to displaced families. Residents said there was no warning.

About a week later, 13 people, including a child,were killed in an Israeli attackon an area near the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, Lebanon’s biggest public health facility, in the capital Beirut. Though warnings were issued for the southern suburbs before they were hit with heavy strikes, the attack around the hospital came without warning.

Israel and Hezbollah started trading cross-border attacks a day after the war on Gaza began on October 7, 2023. Hezbollah claimed it was supporting Gaza and pressuring Israel for a ceasefire.

Then, in late September, Israel expanded itsassault on Lebanon.

InLebanon, at least 2,867 people have been killed and 13,047 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 2023. The Lebanese Health Ministry says 45 people have been killed across the country in the past 24 hours.

Lebanon Israel War,"Israel has killed at least 71 civilians in Lebanon since ceasefire, UN says","The United Nations says at least 71 civilians have been killed by Israeli forces in Lebanon since a ceasefire was struck at the end of last year.

Thameen Al-Kheetan, spokesperson for the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), said on Tuesday that the death toll included 14 women and nine children. He called for investigations into “each and every military action where civilians are killed”.

OHCHR raised concerns about recent Israeli military operations hitting civilian infrastructure, including a strike on April 3 that destroyed a newly established medical centre run by the Islamic Health Society in the southern city ofNaqoura.

It also noted that at least five rockets, two mortars and a drone have been launched from Lebanon towards northern Israel, according to the Israeli army, and tens of thousands of Israelis remain displaced from the north.

“The ceasefire must hold, and any escalation is a risk for stability in general in Lebanon, Israel and the whole region,” Al-Kheetan said.

Later on Tuesday, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health reported that an Israeli drone strike on a car in the southern town of Aitaroun killed one person and injured three, including a child.

The Israeli military in a statement said the air strike killed “a squad commander in the special operations unit” of Hezbollah.

Israelhas continued to strike Lebanon, including attacks on the capital,Beirut, since a November 27ceasefire, which largely halted more than a year of hostilities between Israel and the armed group Hezbollah, including two months of all-out war.







Under the truce, Hezbollah was to withdraw fighters from south of Lebanon’s Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure there while Israel was to pull out all of its forces from southern Lebanon.

Lebanon’s army has been deploying in the south near the border with Israel as Israeli forces have withdrawn although Israel continues to hold five fortified positions in Lebanon that it deems “strategic”.

Lebanese PresidentJoseph Aountold Al Jazeera on Monday that the army was “dismantling tunnels and warehouses and confiscating weapons bases” south of the Litani “without any problem from Hezbollah”.

On Thursday, a senior Hezbollah official told the Reuters news agency the group is ready to hold talks with the Lebanese president about its weapons if Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon and stops its strikes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/15/israeli-attacks-killed-over-70-in-lebanon-since-ceasefire-un,NEGATIVE,0.9756484627723694
Lebanon Israel War,Israel pounds southern Beirut as Lebanon awaits ceasefire proposals,"Israeli air strikes have targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs for the second consecutive day as Lebanese negotiators awaited a potential new ceasefire proposal from Washington.

Since Wednesday morning, Israeli air strikes levelled half a dozen buildings in Dahiyeh and killed at least eight people in Dawhit Aramoun, a village south of the capital.

Three women and three children were among those killed, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health said.

Israel’s military escalated its attacks on Lebanon in September following nearly a year of trading cross-border fire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which began firing rockets towards Israel in what it says was “solidarity” with Palestinians in Gaza.

Lebanon’s health ministry said since October 8, 3,365 people in Lebanon have been killed by Israeli attacks and 14,344 others wounded.

The Israeli military said its air force had destroyed nine Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and command centres in the Beirut area. It also said that Hezbollah had fired 40 projectiles into Israel.

Later, the army announced that six of its soldiers were killed during fighting in southern Lebanon. Since Israel launched its ground offensive in southern Lebanon, at least 47 Israeli troops have been killed.

Hezbollah said that it fired ballistic missiles at the Israeli army’s headquarters. In a statement, the group said it targeted the site, which houses both the defence ministry and the headquarters of the Israeli military, with Qader-2 missiles.

Earlier, the group said it had targeted the same site with explosive drones, and later said it had fired a salvo of missiles at another site near the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv. It said the site was owned by the Israeli Weapons Industries (IWI) arms manufacturer, which supplies the army.







White House envoy Amos Hochstein, the US official who has led several fruitless attempts to broker a ceasefire over the last year, told Axios that he thought “there is a shot” at a truce in Lebanon soon. “I am hopeful we can get it.”

His comments suggest a possible last-ditch bid by the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden to secure a Lebanon ceasefire.

Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whom Hezbollah has endorsed as its negotiator, was quoted as saying on Wednesday that Lebanon was waiting for concrete ceasefire proposals.

“What is on the table is only Resolution 1701 and its provisions, which must be implemented and adhered to by both sides, not by the Lebanese side alone,” Berri told Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper.

On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said there had been “a certain progress” in ceasefire talks over Lebanon, though the main challenge would be enforcement.

Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, told military commanders Israel would not “take our foot off the pedal, and we will not allow any arrangement that does not include the achievement of our war objectives.”

Katz added that Israel’s war goals include disarming Hezbollah and pushing them beyond the Litani River, which flows across southern Lebanon.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/13/israel-pounds-southern-beirut-as-lebanon-awaits-ceasefire-propsals,NEGATIVE,0.9814215898513794
Lebanon Israel War,Israel is repeating its Gaza assault in Lebanon. Why?,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been clear, tellinga press conferencethat the world “cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza”.

Many prominent Israeli figures seem to want exactly that, however, drawing straight lines between Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon to underscore the threat they pose and justify assaults on Gaza and Lebanon.

Not even a bit.

In Lebanon, Hezbollah is part of a wider tapestry of the political and military mosaic. While it plays a prominent role in the country, it does not have control over the presidency or parliament.

Unlike Gaza, Lebanon is present in international systems of governance and finance. Gaza and Hamas’s links with the international order are primarily via aid provided by organisations like the UN.

Hamas, which has an effective military wing like Hezbollah, governs Gaza completely and has to maintain a functioning society and governing structure.

They’re allies, yes.

Israel has portrayed them as equal extensions of what is typically cast as Israel’s ultimate foe: Iran.

Addressing theUnited States Congress in July, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was behind everything and that its “proxy” forces – Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen – pose an equal threat to Israel and, by extension, the West.

Both groups maintain strong alliances with Iran, but they are distinct from each other, and their relationship with Iran changes.

Hezbollah is more aligned with Iran’s regional goals, while Hamas utilises Iranian support but is more independent.

Hamas broke with Iranfor three years in 2011over its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and it does not seem to have forewarned Iran of its October 7 attack on Israel.

To justify its widespread targeting of civilian areas, Israel has accused both Hamas and Hezbollah of “hiding” their military hardware there.

Israel claims Hamas hides in or near schools, hospitals and homes as it tries to justify the destruction of Gaza.

It also claims Hamas uses UN facilities in Gaza as military fronts “in contravention of the Geneva Convention”.

Israel has also targeted the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) – the only support for Palestinian refugee populations displaced in the ethnic cleansing of 1948’s Nakba by Zionist gangs.

Recently, Israel made similar claims about homes in southern Israel – that they are being used by Hezbollah.

On Monday, Israel released images of what it said was a Hezbollah missile concealed in an attic in southern Lebanon, appearing to be trying to pre-empt criticism of its ongoing strikes.

Pointing to an image, an Israeli military spokesperson said, “It’s ready to launch from an opening in the roof.

“Under the attic, on the first floor, a Lebanese family lives, serving as a human shield.”

At the time of writing, Israel has carried out thousands of strikes on homes across Lebanon.

In Gaza, Israel has shown little concern for fatalities – bombing homes, displacement camps, hospitals and schools.

In Lebanon, Israel sent opaque “evacuation notices” to the citizens of a foreign country ahead of strikes on targets the people may not know are nearby.

The paper notices, text messages and recorded phone calls were cited by Israel as “evidence” that it is trying to avoid civilian casualties.

During a visit to a military base on Tuesday, Netanyahu told the people of Lebanon “our war is not with you; our war is with Hezbollah”, urging the Lebanese people to rise up against the group.

At the time of writing, more than 600 people in Lebanon have been killed in the ongoing Israeli strikes and more than 2,000 injured.

Yes.

In an echo of the attack on Gaza, thousands of terrified Lebanese families have fled southern Lebanon, joining an estimated 110,000 people who fled earlier, seeking shelter wherever possible.

The total number of displaced is about 500,000 now, Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said on Tuesday.

Someareseeking shelter in Palestinian refugee camps in southern Beirut like Shatila – camps that have housed Palestinians fleeing Israeli attacks since the 1940s.

Others are cramming into bomb shelters, sleeping in cars, or crowding into Beirut’s schools, which, unlike the UNRWA-operated schools in Gaza, were never designed to double as shelters.

Because Israel needs a quick end and thinks this will work, said Yousef Munayyer from the Arab Center Washington DC.

In Gaza, Hamas survived a year of Israeli attacks by relying on its tunnel network.

Hezbollah says it has an expansive network of tunnels in Lebanon with extensive munitions in them,as shown in video it released in August.

Israel would struggle more in Lebanon, not least because Hezbollah is stronger.

“And so they’re using the same sort of tactics that they used in Gaza,” Munayyer said. “This is part of an Israeli strategy aimed at bringing great pressure on Hezbollah.”

He said Israel hoped to “get out of the situation without a ground invasion, without a long drawn-out battle” – and to avoid getting bogged down in Lebanon just as it has in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/25/israel-is-repeating-its-gaza-assault-in-lebanon-why,POSITIVE,0.9757035374641418
Lebanon Israel War,"Israel-Hamas war sparks south Lebanon exodus, as people flee border areas","Beirut, Lebanon– Kindergarten teacher Anna’s school in the southern Lebanon village of Barich is closed for a week, but the mother of two sons isn’t celebrating the unexpected days off from work.

Instead, she has brought her children to the capital Beirut, where she has rented an Airbnb. They are not on holiday. They are escaping Israeli missiles.









As Israel’s war on Gaza intensifies after the audacious Hamas attack on Saturday, the conflict is increasingly threatening to spiral across national borders. Even though the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has not yet formally joined the conflict, the consequences of raised tensions with Israel are being felt by communities along the border between the two nations.

Since Sunday, thousands of residents of southern Lebanese villages near the border with Israel have been fleeing their homes, afraid of a potential war breaking out between Israel and Hezbollah.

“Our lives have stopped,” Marie, a 28-year-old wedding planner from a village near Bint Jbeil, told Al Jazeera by phone. “We don’t know when they’ll go back to normal. We are wondering, ‘What’s next?’”

More than 1,400 people in the Gaza Strip have been killed in Israeli strikes that followed the Hamas attack in southern Israel, in which at least 1,300 people died. The prospect of Hezbollah joining the war on the side of Hamas has sparked concerns of a wider regional conflagration.

On Wednesday, Hezbollah hit an Israeli military position with an anti-tank missile. Israel responded by hitting a Hezbollah outpost, as rumours spread that the group’s drones had infiltrated Israeli territory. At least three civilians were injured by Israeli strikes in south Lebanon while at least three Hezbollah members werekilled from Israeli shellingearlier in the week.

Lebanon, a country of six million people, shares an 81-kilometre (50-mile) southern border with Israel. About 600,000 people – or a tenth of the country’s population – live near that border. The two countries have technically been at war since Israel’s creation in 1948, but a relative calm has prevailed since the last time both sides met in battle, in 2006 – though there have been occasional flare-ups.

Locals fear that if hostilities escalate, a war today would be more disastrous than in 2006. In that conflict, 1,109 Lebanese – mostly civilians – were killed while Israel lost 43 civilians and 12 soldiers. Hezbollah’s firepower and experience have grown since then, particularly after 2012, when it deployed fighters to aid its embattled ally, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.

This round of fighting could be even more intense. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah claims his group boasts 100,000 fighters, while Israeli officials have threatened toreturn Lebanon to the Stone Ageshould a war break out.

Memories of the 2006 war still linger in the minds of many residents, so an exodus from the south’s towns and villages is under way to the capital Beirut and its surrounding suburbs.

“I saw what happened in 2006, and I didn’t want to stay,” said Anna, the teacher. “I came for the safety of my kids, just in case anything happens.” As of now, her school is expected to reopen next week and she plans to return to work.







At the moment though, the movement of people is in one direction: away from the border with Israel.

“All the houses are empty,” Marie, whose parents left their hometown near the southern border city of Bint Jbeil on Monday to join her in Beirut, told Al Jazeera.  “It’s not a small movement [of people].”

More than half the 10,000 residents in Rmeish, another border town, have fled to Beirut or the Metn region, just north of Beirut, according to the town’s mayor, Milad El Alam. The town doesn’t have enough medicine, nor a nearby hospital, to deal with a prospective humanitarian crisis should a war break out.

But there’s another factor that makes many people in Lebanon feel more vulnerable than before.

“Today’s situation is completely different from 2006,” El Alam said. “Back then, we had money.”

Since 2019, Lebanon has witnessed largeanti-government protests over economic woesand thebiggest non-nuclear explosionin history. The country’s currency has lost over 90 percent of its value in one of the world’sworst financial crises since the mid-19th centuryaccording to the World Bank. Lebanon’s once prosperous middle class has been devastated with 80 percent of the population now living below the poverty line and 36 percent in severe poverty.







The areas on Lebanon’s periphery have a long history of disenfranchisement and neglect from the state.

Today, poverty levels in south Lebanon are higher than the national average, while salaries are lower, the private sector is in decline, and many locals rely heavily on remittances from relatives abroad. Analysts say a potential conflict would add further stress to an already fraught region.

“A war would have detrimental consequences on the region’s economy,” Hussein Cheaito, an economist with the Arab Watch Coalition, told Al Jazeera. “Education and healthcare are already out of reach for so many people due to privatisation. This will make things even more difficult for so many people in the region with economic insecurity across the board.”

Meanwhile, even as residents panic, the Lebanese government has stayed silent.

El Alam, the mayor, told Al Jazeera he’s only had brief exchanges with the local United Nations peacekeeping force, UNIFIL, but no communication with the government, security forces or any political parties about how to respond to a potential conflict.







But while the threat of war looms, not everyone is leaving their homes. Some remain to work while others simply have no family or friends to host them. Others have decided not to leave out of defiance, a sense of relative safety because they are not right next to the border, or a mixture of both.

“We’re not leaving our houses or our land,” Mohammad Farhat, 71, told Al Jazeera by phone from his village of Arab Salim, around 25km (15 miles) from the border with Israel. “We lived through wars in the past, [so] we’re not scared this time.”

Oussama Haddad, 58, works in imports and exports and lives in a town called Ebel Saqi, about a half hour from the southern border. He’d rather stay in the 135-year-old house his great-grandfather hand-built, he said. Despite the uncertainty, Haddad struggled to imagine how the situation could deteriorate even further.

“You’re in Lebanon, right? Are we not in the stone age already?” he said, referencing the Israeli official’s threats to Hezbollah and the country’s economic crisis.

Having fled his town, Rmeish’s mayor El Alam is worried about what comes next. But like many in Lebanon, he feels powerless.

“We don’t get to decide [if there is war or not],” he said. “If we did, there would be peace in all of Lebanon.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/10/13/israel-hamas-war-sparks-south-lebanon-exodus-as-people-flee-border-areas,NEGATIVE,0.9897192716598511
Lebanon Israel War,Can Lebanon’s Hezbollah afford to go to war with Israel?,"Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement has warned that it is fully ready to fight against Israel after its fighters exchanged fire for days with Israeli soldiers on their border.

Both parties havetraded shellingand rocket fire across their borders since the Palestinian armed faction Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,400 people.

As violence escalates, observers fear thatHezbollahmay open a new front against Israel at the behest of its leaders and their Iranian backers. That scenario may relieve pressure on Hamas and beleaguered civilians in Gaza, but it would be devastating for Lebanon and costly for Israel, analysts told Al Jazeera.

Here’s all you need to know about Hezbollah’s military capabilities:

In July 2006, Hezbollah captured two Israeli fighters on its border which triggered a massive military response from Israel. The war lasted 34 days andresultedin the death of more than 1,100 Lebanese nationals and 165 Israelis.

Nobody conclusively won the war, but Lebanese civilians were the clear losers. Israeldestroyedor damaged about 30,000 homes, 109 bridges and 78 medical facilities, according to the International Committee for the Red Cross.

Nicholas Blanford, an expert on Hezbollah with the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, DC, said the group had 3,000 to 5,000 fighters and short-range missiles to hit Israel.

But over the last 17 years, Hezbollah has significantly improved its military capabilities.

“I think Hezbollah today has the ability to inflict the greatest damage on Israel [since the Jewish state was established] in 1948,” Blanford told Al Jazeera.







Blanford estimated that Hezbollah has at least 60,000 fighters, including full-time and reservists. The group also increased its stockpile of missiles from 14,000 in 2006 to about 150,000 now, he said.

Most are short-range, Hezbollah also has Iranian precision-guided missiles that have a range of 300km (186 miles). Blanford added that Hezbollah’s “special forces” unit is trained to infiltrate Israel in the event of a war.

“It’s not a surprise perhaps that Israeli officials have over the last few years considered Hezbollah to be their primary threat,” he told Al Jazeera.

Randa Slim, the director of the Conflict and Resolutions Program at the Middle East Institute, also told Al Jazeera that the Syrian war – where Hezbollah intervened on the side of President Bashar al-Assad – enabled the group to improve its combat capabilities.

“In Syria, which was a prolonged war, they gained new skills in terms of urban warfare and intelligence. Their intelligence systems improved a lot,” she told Al Jazeera.







While limited border violence between Israel and Hezbollah is not unusual, Slim from the Middle East Institute believes that there is a greater risk for major escalation today.

She said Hezbollah and Iran may decide to open a second front against Israel depending on the level of atrocities committed in Gaza. If Hamas is about to be eradicated, Hezbollah could get involved, she added.

“Iran has brought together a loose collection of players to make up its ‘resistance axis’ which is now a cohesive machine,” Slim said. “Hezbollah has talked about this idea – calling it the unification of fronts – which is like Article 5 of NATO: an attack on one is an attack on all. I don’t think this was the case in the past.”

Despite the risks, Blanford believes that Iran and Hezbollah will exercise restraint. He explained that Hezbollah serves as a major deterrence against any possible Israeli and US plans to attack Iran.

“[If there is a war in Lebanon,] then Hezbollah would be battered and Iran would lose a key means of deterrence,” Blanford said.

However, he did not rule out the possibility of a war. He saidIrancould still activate its proxies against Israel if it deems that now is the most opportune time to attack Israel.

The US is aware of the risk and has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iranian-backed groups from targeting Israel. Israel might have its own plans that exploit US diplomatic efforts and military to attack Hezbollah first, Blanford said.

Hezbollah has the capacity to “inflict a terrible cost on Israel” but is still outmatched, said Slim.

She believes that the group can sustain an assault on Israel that devastates the country’s critical infrastructure such as Ben-Gurion airport and major electricity grids. But in the end, Israel can reduce most of Lebanon to rubble.

“In Syria, the war was different. Hezbollah was fighting against various militias – funded by some Arab governments – but nothing compared to the mighty machine that is the Israeli military,” said Slim.

In any wider conflict, Israel will likely employ what it calls the “Dahiya Doctrine” – named after a civilian neighbourhood and a Hezbollah stronghold in south Beirut – which dictates the use of disproportionate force that targets civilian and military infrastructure.

Imad Salamey, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at the Lebanese American University, warned that a war against Hezbollah could lead to civil strife in Lebanon, which has been passing through economic and political crisis.

He said the migration of mostly Shia Lebanese citizens to majority Christian and Sunni cities in the north may trigger sectarian tensions, a view echoed by other observers.

Critics and opponents of Hezbollah may also explicitly blame the group – and its perceived supporters – for dragging the already beleaguered country into war.

“If [a war] happens, then it won’t be like 2006,” Salamey told Al Jazeera. “There will be fighting and resistance between communities domestically.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/16/can-lebanons-hezbollah-afford-to-go-to-war-with-israel,NEGATIVE,0.9816285371780396
Lebanon Israel War,Analysis: Can the Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire hold?,"Beirut, Lebanon –A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah continued to hold on Friday despite claims from both sides that the other has violated it.

The 60-day United States and French-brokeredceasefire agreementtook effect at 4am on Wednesday after nearly 14 months of cross-border attacks and just over two months after an Israeli escalation that wrought widespread devastation on south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut’s southern suburb, known as Dahiyeh.









Under the ceasefire, southern Lebanon is to be cleared of Hezbollah, who will retreat north of the Litani River and Israel, which is to withdraw from Lebanon to the south of the Blue Line.

The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) are to deploy to monitor the south alongside the UN peacekeepers, UNIFIL.

Clause 2 of theceasefire agreementsays Israel will not carry out offensive operations inside Lebanese territory and the Lebanese government will prevent Hezbollah or other armed groups from attacking Israel.

However, several incidents of Israel attacking within Lebanon have surfaced.

“Technically it looks like the Israelis have already breached clause 2 by opening fire inside Lebanon,” Nicholas Blanford, senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.

Israel has also been trying to restrict people’s movement in southern Lebanon, releasing a map with a zone marked in red, demanding that people from there not go home, “which is not part of the ceasefire agreement”, Blanford said.

Al Jazeera previously reported that Israel could be attempting to create abuffer zonein south Lebanon through the use of white phosphorus and other tactics.

On Thursday, Israeli forces opened fire on people in a car, calling them “suspects”, in southern Lebanon.

Israel claims these “suspects” violated the ceasefire – Hezbollah said Israel had attacked people who were trying to go home.

Israel said Thursday it was imposing a curfew on the south and also attacked what it claimed was a “Hezbollah facility” containing medium-range rockets in the Sidon region, north of the Litani.

Israel also wounded three people in Markaba and two journalists in Khiam – one by gunfire and one from shelling – on Wednesday.

The Lebanese army said on Thursday evening that it was investigating “several” Israeli violations and would compile a report.







While the reported violations by Israel have drawn condemnation from Hezbollah figures, the group has held off on any military response.

Indeed, on Friday, the group reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire deal.

In his first televised address since the truce went into effect, Secretary-General Naim Qassem said he would work with the Lebanese army to enforce the ceasefire, adding that he did not envision “problems or disagreement” with the army.

“The coordination between the resistance and the Lebanese army will be at a high level,” Qassem said.

Nearly 14 months of war, as Hezbollah and Israeli forces exchanged near-daily fire since the war on Gaza began in October 2023, have taken an especially heavy toll on people from the border villages.

On the Lebanese side, at least 3,961 people have been killed by Israeli fire. About 140 soldiers and civilians have been killed by Hezbollah fire in Israel.

Israel’s attacks, which ramped up when it invaded Lebanon in September, have caused large-scale destruction to homes and infrastructure across the country, the World Bank estimating $2.8bn in damage to residential homes alone.

An estimated 99,000 homes have been partially or completely destroyed.

As thousands of people beganreturning to their homeson Wednesday, many Lebanese feared the attacks had not come to a full stop.

In Beirut’s Khandaq al-Ghamik neighbourhood, an Israeli attack destroyed several floors of a residential building on the last day before the ceasefire.

On Wednesday, Sleiman Omairat stood outside the neighbouring building where he lives and has an office. His office had been destroyed by the debris from the blast, as had his car, parked out front.

“There’s still no sense of security,” he said. “The Zionists don’t let you have any.”

For now, however, Omairat said the ceasefire had “restored dignity in the country” thanks to “the boys in the south”, referring to Hezbollah.







As the ceasefire took hold, Hezbollah took the opportunity to claim victory.

On Thursday, it said it had achieved “victory over the delusional enemy who could not undermine its resolve or break its will”.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant spoke often of wanting to destroy Hezbollah’s military capacity, implying Israel would not stop until that had been achieved.

Yet, Hezbollah launched attacks on Israel until the final hours before the ceasefire.

But it seems both sides have had to cede ground. Despite Hebollah’s survival and continued ability to fire rockets and missiles, analysts said “victory” came with compromise for it as well.

Before his assassination, Hezbollah’s late leaderHassan Nasrallahset one condition for ending the war: ending Israel’s war on Gaza. That has not happened and, ultimately, the link between the Gaza and Lebanon fronts broke with this ceasefire.

“The party stood firm … it offered the most important thing it had for the sake of Palestine and Gaza,” political commentator Kassem Kassir, who is understood to be close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.

“It’s difficult to deny that this war has been bad for Hezbollah,” Elia Ayoub, a United Kingdom-based writer, researcher and author of the Hauntologies political newsletter, explaining that Hezbollah experienced myriad losses.

But, Ayoub said, Israel’s behaviour towards Lebanon will have provided further grounds for those who believe in armed resistance.

“The fact that the Israelis are no longer able to occupy south Lebanon as they once did reinforces Hezbollah’s narrative that the only way for Lebanon to not follow the path of Gaza or the West Bank is militarisation,” Ayoub said.

In the meantime, however, analysts say Hezbollah has other priorities with its community reeling, caught up with rebuilding homes and lives.

Now is not the time for retaliation against ceasefire violations, they say – it would be too damaging for people in Lebanon.







“Hezbollah on the ground was in a precarious position and, of course, the community at large was too, with 1.2 million displaced and no end in sight,” Michael Young, a Lebanon expert for Carnegie Middle East Center, told Al Jazeera.

Hezbollah would not open a front against Israel again with people returning to their homes in the south, he said, adding: “It would be insane.

“Hezbollah right now is going to be more … concentrated on looking at the welfare needs of the Shia community that’s been battered,” Blanford said. “That’s going to be their priority even beyond rebuilding their military capacity.”

The post-war reality leaves major questions about Hezbollah’s future.

“They’re going to have to undergo a major reorganisation,” Blanford said. “Their top leadership has been decapitated and, while they’ve got plenty of other folks who can take over, they need to reorganise and clean shop.

“Clearly the Israelis penetrated this organisation thoroughly and that enabled them to kill top commanders whenever they wanted,” he said. “They need to figure out what went wrong and how to amend it.”

Lebanon Israel War,‘Unimaginable consequences’: World reacts to Israel’s strikes on Lebanon,"World leaders are sounding the alarm about a “full-fledged” war, calling for de-escalation after devastatingIsraeli air strikes in Lebanonratcheted regional tensions amid Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza.

The attacks, which started on Monday and continued into Tuesday, wereIsrael’s fiercest againstits northern neighbour and have led to Lebanon’s highest single-day death toll since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.

On Tuesday, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said the Israelistrikes killed 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women. Health Minister Firass Abiad told a press conference in Beirut that at least 1,835 people were wounded, and 54 hospitals are treating patients.

Here are some reactions:

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “gravely alarmed by the escalating situation along the Blue Line”, referring to the demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, as well as “the large number of civilian casualties”.

His spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, told Al Jazeera that “it is not too late to go back to diplomacy”.

“It’s clear that the people of Lebanon, the people of Israel and of the region cannot afford a full-scale war,” he said, adding that UN representatives were on the ground to push for a diplomatic solution.

Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the UN Human Rights Office, said, “International humanitarian law is very clear. All parties to an armed conflict must at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives.”

In a statement that said “the laws of war also oblige all parties to observe the principle of proportionality”, Shamdasani called for independent and transparent investigations into incidents in which civilians were killed or seriously wounded.

UNICEF head Catherine Russell highlighted the “dangerous escalation” that threatens “countless” children.

“Alarming levels of psychological distress” have also been reported among children due to displacement and from the barrage of shelling and air raids, she said, calling for an immediate de-escalation.

Iran, an ally of Lebanese group Hezbollah that Israel says it is targeting, accused Israel of trying to bait it into a conflict that would have “irreversible consequences”.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said: “We want to live in peace, we don’t want war,” adding, “It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict.”

“We know more than anyone else that if a larger war were to erupt in the Middle East, it will not benefit anyone throughout the world,” he said.

In an interview to CNN, the president said: “We must not allow for Lebanon to become another Gaza at the hands of Israel.”

“Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being defended and supported and supplied by Western countries – European countries, and the United States of America,” he told the broadcaster.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called Israel’s strikes “insane” and said they would carry “dangerous consequences”.







Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi urged for a global response to de-escalate the conflict, accusing Israel of “aggression”.

“We stress the urgent need for the [UN] Security Council to take immediate action to curb Israeli aggression”.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the UNSC to intervene and denounced any “violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty”.

Egypt, which is a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, has repeatedly warned against a regional escalation, which it said “threatens to drag the region into a comprehensive regional war”.

Expressing “solidarity” with Lebanon, Egypt said it “continues its efforts towards a ceasefire in Gaza”.

Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned Israel’s attacks on Lebanon and also noted how last week’s cyber terror attacks in Lebanon, showed how technologies can be transformed into deadly weapons.

He said that “Israel’s deceptive moves should no longer be given any credence.”

“In an environment where UN Security Council resolutions are not implemented, coercive measures should be taken against Israel,” Erdogan said.

“Just as 70 years ago Hitler was stopped by an alliance of humanity, Netanyahu and his murderous network must also be stopped by alliance of humanity,” he added.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Israel’s aggression “in the strongest terms”.

“[The] continued escalation is primarily due to the absence of any deterrent to Israel’s actions, its continued repeated violations of international law, and its continued impunity,” it said in a statement.

“This reality exacerbates crises, puts the region on the brink of the abyss, and exposes it to more tensions that will have a profound impact regionally and internationally,” it added.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was following the developments in Lebanon with “great concern” and urged “all parties to exercise the utmost restraint”.

It emphasised the “importance of respecting Lebanon’s sovereignty” while calling on the international community to play a role in de-escalating the region.

The Gulf country expressed “deep concern” and reiterated its stance against “violence, escalation, uncalculated actions and reactions that disregard laws governing state relations and sovereignty”, state media reported.



The US, which has sent Israelbillions of dollars in weaponssince the Gaza war broke out while also pushing a strained Israel-Hezbollah mediation drive, still held out hope that two parties could step back from the brink of war.

“My team is in constant contact with their counterparts, and we’re working to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return home safely,” said President Joe Biden, who met UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the White House.

While the Pentagon said the US is sending additional troops to the Middle East in response to developments in Lebanon, spokesman Patrick Ryder did not specify the strength of additional forces being deployed or their specific task.

The US has about 40,000 soldiers in the region.







“In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region. But for operational security reasons, I’m not going to comment on or provide specifics,” Ryder said.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that the killing of women and children in Lebanon was “extraordinarily concerning” and called on Israel and Hezbollah to de-escalate their conflict.

“The violence needs to stop. The women, the children killed in Lebanon is extraordinarily concerning,” Trudeau told reporters in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly.

“We need to make sure there is de-escalation, both by Israel and Hezbollah. We need to protect civilian lives. We need to make sure we’re moving towards peace and stability in the entire region,” Trudeau added.

The G7 called for a “a stop to the current destructive cycle” that could catapult the “entire Middle East into a broader regional conflict with unimaginable consequences”.

“Actions and counter-reactions risk magnifying this dangerous spiral of violence,” said a statement by the G7, made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he was “deeply alarmed” by the ongoing air raids in Lebanon and Israel.

“Further escalation risks even more devastating consequences. I repeat my call for an immediate ceasefire on both sides,” he posted on social media platform X.

Foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned “we are almost in a full-fledged war” and called for full efforts at de-escalation during theUN General Assembly in New York.

Pointing to the increasing number of civilian casualties and the intensity of Israel’s strikes, he said, “If this is not a war situation, I don’t know what you would call it.”

“Here in New York is the moment to do that. Everybody has to put all their capacity to stop this path to war,” he added.

The country that was elected as a member of the UNSC for 2025-26 earlier this year said the escalation showed a collective international failure.

“We have not prevented the spillover, and the more dispersed the war becomes, the more the situation becomes more complicated to be solved,” Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis told the Reuters news agency.

“Lebanon could easily be a zone of tremendous hostility, and this is something that we cannot deal with. It’s a clear minefield.”

France said strikes on both sides of the border should “immediately end” and called for an emergency UNSC meeting to address the conflict.

“I’m thinking of the Lebanese people as Israeli strikes have just killed hundreds of civilians, including dozens of children,” said Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “These strikes conducted on both sides of the Blue Line, and in the region more broadly, must immediately end.”

Deputy Prime Minister Petra de Sutter said she was “shocked” by the casualty toll from Israel’s attacks on Lebanon.

“492 lives lost in Lebanon. +1600 injured. Tens of 1000s were ordered to flee their homes. In 1 day,” she wrote on X.

“This horrendous attack by Israel won’t lead to any solution for the region. Only diplomacy will bring citizens home safely. Only a ceasefire will end the suffering,” she added.







Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China firmly backs Lebanon in safeguarding its sovereignty and strongly condemned Israel’s attacks.

“We pay close attention to developments in the region, especially the recent explosion of communications equipment in Lebanon, and firmly oppose indiscriminate attacks against civilians,” Wang told his Lebanese counterpart, Abdallah Bou Habib, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Wang said China would stand on the “side of justice and on the side of Arab brothers, including Lebanon”, according to the statement.

The Kremlin said the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah risked destabilising the region.

“It is, of course, an event that is potentially very dangerous,” risking expansion of the zone of the conflict and “complete destabilisation of the region”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.

Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said, “It is urgent to stop the spiral of violence before the situation spirals completely out of control. We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities.”

“We must do everything possible to prevent the Middle East from plunging into a full-scale armed conflict, the devastating consequences of which will inevitably affect everyone in the region and beyond,” she added.

The US-based nonprofit said Israel’s actions show “it wants a broad regional war, not just in the occupied Palestinian territory, but also in Lebanon and Iran”.

“The only way to stop its untethered belligerence is to stop rewarding it with more and more American weapons,” said Raed Jarrar, DAWN’s advocacy director.

“Without halting Israel’s attacks in the region, there will be no path to peace, and the consequences will reverberate far beyond Lebanon’s borders.”

The UK-based group highlighted the conflict’s effect on children as they are forced to flee their towns and villages with their families.

“We’re seeing strikes in dozens of towns, families desperately trying to flee with whatever they can carry, children crying, terrified by the sound of drones and fighter jets,” said country director Jennifer Moorehead, noting that some 1.5 million children are out of school due to the conflict.

Lebanon Israel War,Israeli forces step up attacks across Lebanon after ‘limited’ ground raids,"The Israeli army says it has killed a commander of the Imam Hussein division, referring to a Hezbollah-linked group based in Syria, in a strike in Beirut as it stepped up attacks across Lebanon.

Israel also said on Tuesday that its forces killed Hezbollah commander Muhammad Jaafar Qasir, describing him as being responsible for weapons transfers from Iran and its affiliates to the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.

The announcements came as Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday in what it said was retaliation for the assassinations of Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officials. Israel promised a “painful response”, saying that more than 180 missiles were launched into Israel from Iran and Israeli air defences were activated to intercept them.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Iran had launched tens of missiles at Israel and that if Israel retaliated, Tehran’s response would be “more crushing and ruinous”. Tehran targeted three Israeli military bases in its attack, Iran’s state news agency said.

It comes a day after Israel said it sent ground troops into southern Lebanon in what it described as a “limited” operation against Hezbollah targets.

While Hezbollah denied that Israeli troops had entered Lebanon, the Israeli army announced it had also carried out dozens of ground raids into southern Lebanon going back nearly a year.







Israeli forces have continued to launch attacks on towns and villages across the border as well as on the densely-populated southern Beirut suburbs.

In an attack on Tuesday evening, Israeli air raids struck two areas in Beirut’s Dahiyeh neighbourhood, hitting a building in Jnah near the Zahraa Hospital, and a building near the Kuwaiti embassy, Lebanon’s National News Agency said.

Israel also warned Lebanese people to evacuate border towns as it conducted its ground operation.

Almost 240,000 people, mostly Syrians, have crossed to Syria since Israel began pounding the country last week, Lebanese authorities said.

A report from the country’s disaster management unit has registered “the crossing of 176,080 Syrian citizens and 63,373 Lebanese citizens into Syrian territory” from September 23.

Iran had promised to retaliate following Israeli strikes that have killed many of the top leaders of its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, including the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hamas, the Palestinian group in Gaza, praised the Iranian missile strikes, saying they avenged the Israeli assassinations of three leaders, including Nasrallah.

In Washington, President Joe Biden said the United States was prepared to help Israel defend itself from Iranian missile attacks.

Writing on X about a meeting held with Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House national security team earlier in the day, Biden said: “We discussed how the United States is prepared to help Israel defend against these attacks, and protect American personnel in the region.”

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, condemned what he called “escalation after escalation”, saying: “This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

A ground campaign into Lebanon for the first time in 18 years pitting Israeli soldiers against Hezbollah would be a major regional escalation.

Near the city of Sidon along the Mediterranean south of Beirut, mourners wept over coffins containing black-shrouded bodies of people killed in Israeli strikes.

“The building got struck down and I couldn’t protect my daughter or anyone else. Thank God, my son and I got out, but I lost my daughter and wife, I lost my home, I have become homeless. What do you want me to say? My whole life changed in a second,” said resident Abdulhamid Ramadan.

Hezbollah fighters responded to Israeli attacks by firing a barrage of rockets into Israel on Tuesday. There was no immediate word on casualties.









Hezbollah has been reeling from weeks of targeted strikes that killed its leadership. Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Health.

Anticipating more rocket attacks from Hezbollah, the Israeli army announced new restrictions on public gatherings and closed beaches in northern and central Israel. The military also said it was calling up thousands more reserve soldiers to serve on the northern border.

Earlier on Tuesday, an Israeli military official said Hezbollah had launched rockets at central Israel, setting off air raid sirens and wounding a man. Hezbollah said it fired salvos of a new kind of medium-range missile at the headquarters of two Israeli intelligence agencies near Tel Aviv.

The Israeli military official said Hezbollah had also launched projectiles at Israeli areas near the border, targeting soldiers.

Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy said Israel, in its two major wars it fought previously inside Lebanon, “always started in a very limited way, very limited scale”.

“I’m very afraid that it will repeat itself now, and that [the situation in] Gaza will happen in Lebanon,” Levy told Al Jazeera. He said Israel is motivated by its recent military successes, such as the assassination of Nasrallah and the explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon.

“The world is totally passive, so Israel feels that it can go on,” Levy warned. “I think nothing is going to stop Israel from going on and this will cost the lives of many people.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/israeli-forces-step-up-attacks-across-lebanon-after-limited-ground-raids,NEGATIVE,0.9953064322471619
Lebanon Israel War,Israel kills Hezbollah field commander in Lebanon strike,"The Israeli military says it has killed a Hezbollah commander in an overnight air strike in Lebanon, as the United Nations warns that shelling was spreading and urges a halt to thecycle of violence.

Ali Ahmad Hussein of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force was “eliminated” by Israeli jets in the area of as-Sultaniyah in southern Lebanon, the Israeli military said in a statement on Monday, accusing him of attacks against Israeli targets in recent months.

At least three other Hezbollah fighters were also killed in the strike, Al Jazeera has learned.

Meanwhile, dozens of rockets have been launched from Lebanon into theIsraeli-occupied Golan Heights.

Hezbollah fighters said they were targeting an army base and air defence posts in the area.

Hezbollah and the Israeli military have been exchanging fire across Lebanon’s southern frontier in parallel with the Gaza war, adding to fears of a wider regional conflict.

Israeli strikes have killed about 270 Hezbollah fighters in the last six months, as well as around 50 civilians, including children, medics and journalists.

Hezbollah’s rocket fire has killed around a dozen Israeli soldiers and half as many civilians.







The shelling has displaced more than a hundred thousand people oneach side of the border, and hit the farming economy in southern Lebanon particularly hard, with bombed-out fields left unplanted or unharvested.

Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Kafra in southern Lebanon, said the cross-border fighting and strikes illustrate the “changing dynamics in the past months” since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

“At the beginning, the conflict was contained. But now, we can’t say that any more,” he said, citing as an example the “unprecedented” Hezbollah attack in the occupied Golan Heights.

In a joint statement on Monday, UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Joanna Wronecka, and the commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, Aroldo Lazaro, said the violence must stop.

“The unrelenting cycle of strikes and counterstrikes in breach of the cessation of hostilities constitute the most serious violation of Security Council Resolution 1701 since its adoption in 2006,” they said.

Lebanon Israel War,Can a Hezbollah-Israel war trigger civil strife in Lebanon?,"Beirut, Lebanon– Hezbollah’s effort to contain – as opposed to ending – its low-level conflict with Israel is drawing praise and condemnation from across Lebanon.

The split harks back to the 1975-1990 civil war, which split political factions across class and sectarian lines in support of or opposition to the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel being waged from Lebanon.

Now, as Israel threatens an all-out war against Iran-backed Hezbollah, sectarian tensions are climbing.

Hezbollah’s critics and political rivals blame it for waging a war against Israel without consulting other factions as Lebanon struggles to recover from a devastated economy.

Hezbollah started engaging Israel on October 8, saying it will continue until there is a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 37,000 people and uprooted most of the population.

Israel’s war on Gaza started after a Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, in which 1,139 people were killed and 250 taken captive.

With no victory or achievements to claim nine months later, Israel may be in a predicament in Gaza, but is yet disproportionately responding to Hezbollah’s attacks and threatening another war there.

“Nobody wants a war now, but it is Israel that is the one waging conflict,” said Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese political analyst believed to be close to Hezbollah.

“If Israel launches a [full-scale] war, it will be an open and major one.”

Some people in Lebanon, particularly from the Christian community, are very unhappy with Hezbollah.

Samir Gagea and Samy Gemayel, Christian politicians who head the Lebanese Forces and Kataeb parties respectively, blame Hezbollah for dragging Lebanon into an avoidable “‘war of attrition” and drawing Israeli attacks to Lebanese soil.

Since October 8, Israel has killed about 88 civilians in south Lebanon, while Hezbollah attacks have killed 10 Israeli civilians.

Geagea and Gemayel’s rhetoric could signal that they do not want to get drawn into a regional conflict, Michael Young, an analyst on Lebanon and the author of The Ghosts of Martyrs Square: An Eyewitness Account of Lebanon’s Life Struggle, told Al Jazeera.

“Many Christian leaders are opposed to Hezbollah’s decision to open a front against Israel,” he said, adding that an additional intent may be “to show that not all of Lebanon is behind Hezbollah in hopes of perhaps sparing their areas the worst of a war with Israel”.

Others agree that Hezbollah should have not taken a “unilateral” decision.

“Hezbollah clearly stated that they have opened the front [in south Lebanon] to support Hamas against Israel’s invasion. But as a Lebanese citizen … Hezbollah did not consult anyone when it took this decision,” said Doumit Azzi, a Lebanese human rights activist.

Azzi believes Hezbollah is an arm of the Iranian regime andreferenced the group’s interference in Syria’s civil warto support President Bashar al-Assad against a rebellion.

“The situation [in Lebanon] is not black and white. I won’t stand by Israel’s colonial project or another imperialism that has committed atrocities in Syria during the uprising,” Azzi told Al Jazeera.

Others view Hezbollah as a grassroots resistance group that liberated south Lebanon fromIsrael’s 18-year occupation in 2000.

Hezbollah has become more sophisticated since then, expanding its combat capabilities, weapons arsenal and revenue streams, experts previously told Al Jazeera.

It has long branded itself as the face of the “axis of resistance”, which includes Iran-backed militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, as well as Hamas.

Amal Saad, a political analyst and the author of Hezbollah: Politics and Religion, said Hezbollah’s main opponents today are Christian factions.







“The de-sectarian region – no more Sunni/Shia tensions like during the Syrian war – is going to make the climate more favourable for Hezbollah,” she said.

“Generally speaking, it’s more Christians vs Shia now.”

Saad added that rival factions have long tried to strip Hezbollah of its weapons and capabilities, which the group guards jealously as a means to defend against Israel.

An example, she said, was the Lebaneseparliament’s decision in May 2008to dismantle Hezbollah’s secure telephone network.

Hezbollah reacted by laying siege to West Beirut until the order was reversed.

The brief standoff brought the country to the edge of a civil war.

The daily killing of Palestinians in Gaza makes some pro-Hezbollah supporters call for more action against Israel.

“I don’t think Hezbollah is doing enough,” a member of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party, who went by the name Gamal Hassaniya, told Al Jazeera.

“They should invade Israel and what happens, happens,” he said.

Hassaniya acknowledged, however, that Israel would respond forcefully, likely triggering mass displacement.

Lebanese Shia would have to resettle in Sunni – and possibly Christian – heartlands throughout the country.

A wave of displacement to Christian towns and neighbourhoods “might” lead to civil strife, Kataeb Party spokesperson Patrick Richa, said.

“We will have to separate between civilians and military people,” Richa told Al Jazeera.

“We will not accept –  in our region where [our constituents] exist – any military platforms that might lead to military repercussions,” Richa told Al Jazeera.

But Young does not see Hezbollah setting up military operations in any Christian areas if a war with Israel erupts because it does not want to stir sectarian tensions, which would be advantageous for Israel.

“Israel will weaponise whatever it can weaponise [against Hezbollah],” he said.

“But the Lebanese political class has no interest in playing along with an Israeli game that would heighten sectarian tensions.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/7/3/can-a-hezbollah-israel-war-trigger-civil-strife-in-lebanon,POSITIVE,0.9813388586044312

Lebanon Israel War,Israel forces kill two in south Lebanon as displaced people try to return,"Israeli forces shot and killed at least two people and wounded 17 on Monday in the second day of deadly protests in southern Lebanon, health officials said, as residents displaced by the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah attempted to return to villages whereIsraeli soldiers remain.

The shootings came a day after 24 people were killed and more than 130 were wounded when Israeli troopsopened fire on protesterswho breached roadblocks set up along the border.

Under a United States-brokered ceasefire on November 27, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River, about 30km (20 miles) from the border, by January 26.

While the Lebanese army and United Nations peacekeepers had already deployed in several villages before the deadline,Israeli forces remainin more than a dozen villages.

The US and Lebanon announced on Sunday that the deadline to meet the ceasefire terms had been extended to February 18.

Protests resumed on Monday, particularly in eastern border villages where residents again attempted to return home.

Israeli troops opened fire, killing one person in the town of Odaisseh and wounding seven others across four southern villages, the Health Ministry reported.

The Israeli military has blamed Hezbollah for pushing people to protest and has said soldiers fired warning shots when demonstrators approached.

In the village of Aitaroun on Monday, scores of unarmed residents, some waving Hezbollah flags, marched hand in hand or rode motorcycles, escorted by ambulances, bulldozers and Lebanese army tanks. They approached the edge of the town but stopped short of Israeli positions, unable to enter.

“We are coming with our heads held high and crowned with victory to our village, Aitaroun,” Saleem Mrad, head of the municipality, told the Associated Press news agency. “Our village is ours, and we will bring it back more beautiful than it was before. We are staying.”

Lebanon’s official state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported that Israel dropped a bomb at the entrance of the southern village of Yaroun to deter residents from proceeding further.

In the town of Bint Jbeil, Hezbollah members handed out flyers featuring slain leaderHassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in September, with the words: “Victory has arrived.” Some residents waved Hezbollah flags.

“They think they are scaring us with their bullets, but we lived under the bombing, and bullets don’t scare us,” Mona Bazzi told the AFP news agency in Bint Jbeil.

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Lebanon’s capital Beirut, said the protests are a show of defiance by Hezbollah and its supporters.

“Hezbollah has been severely weakened by the war last year, but this was a message from the group that it has not been destroyed and it still has influence in this country,” she said.







THe NNA reported on Monday that Lebanese “army reinforcements” had arrived near Meiss el-Jabal, a border town where residents had gathered to enter alongside the military.

The news agency added that Israeli forces “opened fire in the direction of the Lebanese army” near Meiss el-Jabal, though no casualties were reported.

“We waited in a long line for hours but couldn’t enter,” Mohammed Choukeir, 33, told AFP from Meiss el-Jabal, noting that Israeli troops were intermittently firing at civilians gathered at the town’s entrance.

In Hula, where the Health Ministry confirmed two injuries, the NNA reported that residents had managed to enter after the Lebanese army deployed across several neighbourhoods.

Both sides have traded accusations for delays in the implementation of the deal.

Israel blamed the Lebanese army for not deploying to the region fast enough, while the Lebanese military accused Israel of stalling its withdrawal, complicating its deployment efforts.









On Sunday, the Lebanese army confirmed it had entered several border areas, including Dhayra, Maroun al-Ras, and Aita al-Shaab.

Some family members who entered border villages on Sunday discovered the bodies of their relatives. Israeli attacks killed more than 4,000 people during the war.

Since the ceasefire began, Israel has conducted near-daily operations such as house demolitions, shelling and air attacks in southern Lebanon, accusing Hezbollah of violating ceasefire terms by attempting to move weapons. Lebanon in turn has accused Israel of hundreds of ceasefire violations.

Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee reiterated on Monday his call for southern Lebanon residents to “wait” before returning.

Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut, said that he did not expect a resurgence of major violence.

“Hezbollah no longer wants any further confrontation with Israel; its goal is to protect its achievements in Lebanon,” he told AFP.

Lebanon Israel War,Israel bombs Beirut; President Aoun calls for international pressure,"Israel has struck Beirut’s southern suburbs after issuing an evacuation warning, the third Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital since a ceasefire took effect in late November.

A huge plume of smoke rose over the area after the strike on Sunday. There was no immediate word on casualties.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the air strike and called for France and the United States, guarantors of the November 27 ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, to compel Israel to halt its attacks. Israel has violated that truce multiple times in recent months and weeks with attacks on the capital and across southern Lebanon.

Aoun said Israel is undermining stability in Lebanon and escalating tensions, posing “real dangers to the security” of the region.

The Israeli military said the attack on Beirut destroyed “an infrastructure where precision missiles” were stored by Hezbollah. It did not provide proof for its claim. No secondary explosions were reported after the Israeli attack.

Local platforms have published footage filmed in the immediate aftermath of the bombardment. This video has been verified by Al Jazeera:

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting in Beirut, said: “We were able a short while ago to reach the site that was targeted, but there was a lot of chaos, and we were told to leave.”

“The damage was widespread, also affecting nearby buildings. Windows were blown out, glass was on the floor, cars were damaged,” she added.

“This strike did come with a warning but without any provocation,” Khodr said. “This is not the first time that Beirut’s southern suburb has been hit since Israel and Hezbollah agreed to that ceasefire back in November, but this time, there was no rocket fire. So people here are concerned that Israel is rewriting the rules of engagement, saying that there are no red lines any longer and that this could be the beginning of an escalation.”

Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese army general, told Al Jazeera the Israeli strike on Beirut – and the warning that preceded it – may have been aimed at gathering intelligence on Hezbollah.

Hanna said such an operation is known as “pinging the system”.

“If you have information on certain individuals or facilities, you send the warning, and you wait to see how these officials or leaders will respond,” he said. “Will they move from one place to another?”

Hanna added that the operation could confirm or dismiss certain information, which would be a “win-win” scenario for intelligence gathering.

During the yearlong war, Israeli drones and fighter jets regularly bombarded the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah has widespread influence and support. Israel assassinated several of Hezbollah’s top leaders there, including Secretary-GeneralHassan Nasrallah.

The US has pressured Lebanon to disarm Hezbollah, but Aoun has warned this is a“delicate”matter that must be handled in a way that preserves peace in the religiously diverse country. Hezbollah, which views itself as the resistance to Israel, says it will not disarm.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/27/israel-bombs-beirut-president-aoun-calls-for-international-pressure,NEGATIVE,0.9891915917396545
Lebanon Israel War,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.
