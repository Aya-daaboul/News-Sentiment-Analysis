Climate change,Taiwan faces water wake-up call as climate change intensifies,"Taipei, Taiwan– Every year on May 8, the Japanese engineer Hatta Yochi is honoured as a deity for overseeing the construction of the Wushantou Reservoir and the Chianan Irrigation Canal that transformed Taiwanese agriculture a century ago by allowing the government to store and transport rainwater.

This year, however, as incense and flowers were left at a statute of Hatta at Wushantou, his beloved reservoir was at half capacity while others like it fell as low as 10 to 15 percent as Taiwan faced one of its worst droughts ever.

As an island, Taiwan is dependent on the annual typhoon season to bring enough rainwater to meet its domestic and industrial needs, but it was forced to scramble after a typhoon failed to hit last year for the first time in decades, worsened by limited rainfall.

Domestic water use was rationed while thousands of trucks transported water to supply its lucrative semiconductor industry, angering farmers because much of that water had been earmarked for them.

While Taiwan’s reservoirs were eventually refilled after heavy rain – so much so that it led to flooding in the south – experts have said the island’s recent troubles are just a taste of what is to come with climate change.

“What seems to be happening in Taiwan is the severity of drought is increasing. It’s not just that they are getting less rain, it’s that they are incredibly dry for longer period of times, so they are now in situation where they have to look at solutions like those in countries that have traditionally have issues with water supply,” said Nneka Chike-obi, a director of sustainable finance at Fitch Ratings.

Typhoons meet about half of Taiwan’s annual water needs, but they will be less reliable as climate change has already begun to affect not only their pathway across the Asia Pacific, but also their intensity, according to agroundbreaking reportreleased this month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

“Right now, the IPCC report says in the Pacific, typhoon pathways will go north and that means while on average three to four typhoons hit Taiwan now, it will maybe be less in the future. It’s a warning to Taiwan. Climate change is not only about this year next year but 10 years or 20 years later,” said Chi-Ming Peng, the founder WeatherRisk, Taiwan’s first private weather-focused company. “Every year, it’s the same cycle. When we have drought issues, we talk and push the government we need to do something. But later, when the rain comes, everything will stop.”

Tackling Taiwan’s water crisis will be politically difficult for the government.

Their reservoirs can only hold 6.2 billion tonnes of water,  according to the Taiwan Water Resource Agency, but sediment takes up to 25 to 30 percent of capacity in many of them.

Building new dams would be politically unpopular due to their environmental damage, while cutting down on water would require tinkering with two of Taiwan’s biggest industries – farming and chipmaking.

More than two-thirds of the island’s water is used by the agricultural sector, much of which goes towards the twice-yearly cultivation of rice in flooded fields and tropical fruit.

Reducing water use would require farmers to adopt new methods of irrigation like precision irrigation, but this could be a challenge in an industry dominated by small-holders whose average age was 62 in 2015, according to Taiwan’s Council of Agriculture.

They also have had few incentives in the past to change because water was so cheap – with one tonne costing roughly 30 US cents.

Wang Yi-fung, the deputy director-general of the Water Resource Agency, told Al Jazeera the government is considering paying farmers to switch one of their rice harvests to a less water-intensive crop, and also plans to invest in smart irrigation gates that will reduce water leakage, another key issue in domestic and agricultural use.

The government  is also looking to novel methods like technology that can measure soil moisture to reduce water waste as well as traditional ones like wastewater reclamation plants, similar to those used on Taiwan’s outlying islands, as well as digging more deep water wells.

“In Taiwan, the climate change impact is twofold: one is we will have many, many more flooding events, and on the other hand we will have more and more droughts. For us, the Water Resource Agency, the future challenge is getting bigger and bigger,” Wang said.

During the recent drought, Taiwan’s semiconductor industry was the focus of international media attention as the world faced a chip shortage as their production capacity fell due to a lack of water.

Consuming about 20 percent of Taiwan’s water, some of the tech sector’s needs could be met by a new desalination plants that will turn seawater into fresh water, but there are concerns about the price. At about $1 per tonne it could be unaffordable for anyone other than companies like TSMC,Taiwan’s largest chipmaker.

Chike-obi said if Taiwan were to divert water again to the tech industry during a drought, it might not meet the same understanding by domestic users and farmers who had to limit their use. Similar scenarios have caused unrest in places such as India when farmers were asked to limit water use.

“The financial fortunes of the agricultural sector are really going to be hit hard if Taiwan faces another drought next year. The question will be, ‘How are we going to make this work for everybody not just the semiconductor industry?’ The average person is not going to be as willing to make continued sacrificed if next year is dry and the year after is dry.”

However, seeing Taiwan’s most important industry struggle could be the wake-up call that some may need to fully understand and address the very real dangers that Taiwan faces from climate change.

“Seeing such a high-value tech sector be impacted is interesting and I think that’s why this story about Taiwan has gotten a lot of interest. People are realising climate change isn’t just something that happens to farmers in California when it doesn’t rain, or fires in Australia, but it impacts high-value products that are economy has become reliant on,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/20/taiwan-water-woes
Climate change,What does Islam say about climate change and climate action?,"Many Muslim majority countries bear the brunt of climate change, but their cultural awareness of it and climate action are often staggeringly limited.

A movement of “Islamic environmentalism” based on Islamic tradition – rather than imported “white saviour” environmentalism based on first-world political campaigns – can address both. And the post-COVID-19 lull in emissions is an opportunity to fast-track this.









It is a movement we sorely need. My home country Turkey, for example, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as temperatures are rising and rainfall is decreasing year on year, causing serious problems with water availability. In Bangladesh, it is estimated that by 2050 one in seven will be displaced by climate change, creating millions of climate refugees. In the Middle East, large areas are likely to become uninhabitable due to heatwaves likely to sweep over the region in the next few decades.

However, despite their vulnerability, many Muslim countries are contributing to the problem. Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world, is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and is doing little to curb emissions. Bangladesh and Pakistan are the two most polluted countries in the world, but have taken no serious measures to address pollution. Inaction in the Muslim world persists despite a declaration by Muslim countries in 2015 to play an active role in combatting climate change.

You would think that those most affected by climate change would be the most eager to stop it. This is not always the case. Many Muslim countries are reluctant to impose Western concepts of environmentalism, or to bow to pressure from countries which have already gone through industrialisation without having to address pollution or curb emissions. Environmental colonialism is not the answer.

What would work, and has been proven to work, is using the principles of Islam to encourage conservation in Muslims.

Islam teaches its followers to take care of the earth. Muslims believe that humans should act as guardians, or khalifah, of the planet, and that they will be held accountable by God for their actions. This concept of stewardship is a powerful one, and was used in the Islamic Declaration on Climate Change to propel change in environmental policy in Muslim countries.

In fact, Muslims need to look no further than the Quran for guidance, where there are approximately 200 verses concerning the environment. Muslims are taught that “greater indeed than the creation of man is the creation of the heavens and the earth”. The reality is that nothing could be more Islamic than protecting God’s most precious creation: the earth.

It is this approach that can reach the hearts and minds of the 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, and it must be integrated with, rather than neglected by, the climate movement.

The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) also demonstrated kindness, care and general good principles for the treatment of animals, which form a benchmark for Muslims. He outlawed killing animals for sport, told people not to overload their camels and donkeys, commanded that slaughtering an animal for food be done with kindness and consideration for the animal’s feelings and respect for Allah who gave it life, he even allowed his camel to choose the place where he built his first mosque in the city of Medina.

A 2013 study in Indonesia showed that including environmentalist messages in Islamic sermons led to increased public awareness and concern for the environment. In 2014, Indonesia issued a fatwa (or Islamic legal opinion) to require the country’s Muslims to protect endangered species.

There are also organisations dedicated to using religion to pass on the message of conservation, such as the Alliance for Religions and Conservation (ARC). One of its most successful projects used Islamic scholars to convince Tanzanian fishermen that dynamite, dragnet and spear fishing goes against the Quran – and they listened.

This case also tells us that remote, top-down moralising is unlikely to be effective. The fishermen had previously resisted bans from the government, but were persuaded once they were told that they were acting un-Islamically. One fisherman said: “This side of conservation isn’t from the mzungu [“white man” in Swahili], it’s from the Quran.”

Clearly, we need to speak the language of those whose behaviour we are seeking to change, particularly if that language is naturally averse to unsustainable policies.

Some Muslim thought leaders are aware of this and are eager to develop a “homegrown” environmental movement to emerge as thought leaders in their own right. For example, the Dhaka Forum this month ran a panel on post-COVID-19 environmental issues with the majority of speakers coming from the Muslim world.

Muslim countries have a head start in the climate race. They have a framework and a belief system which mandates protection of the earth and its natural resources. As Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a prominent proponent of the religion and environmentalism movement, argues, the desacralisation of the West has resulted in an ideology that humans have dominion over the earth, rather than stewardship of it, which is the Islamic view.

Muslims must become guardians of the earth once more, for the sake of their environments and for the sake of God.

Climate change,The coronavirus outbreak is part of the climate change crisis,"The speed and scope of thecoronavirus outbreakhave taken world governments by surprise and left the stock market reeling. Since the virus first appeared in China’s Hubei province, it has infected over 700,000 people and killed more than 33,000 across the world in less than six months.

The interconnectedness of our globalised world facilitated the spread of COVID-19. The disruption this continues to cause has made evident societal dependence onglobal production systems.









The pandemic has forced governments into a difficult balancing act between ensuring public safety and wellbeing and maintaining profit margins and growth targets. Ultimately, the prospect of a large death toll and the collapse of health systems have forced countries to put millions of people on lockdown.

These sweeping and unprecedented measures taken by the government and international institutions could not but make some of us wonder about another global emergency that needs urgent action – climate change.

The two emergencies are in fact quite similar. Both have their roots in the world’s current economic model – that of the pursuit of infinite growth at the expense of the environment on which our survival depends – and both are deadly and disruptive.

In fact, one may argue that the pandemic is part of climate change and therefore, our response to it should not be limited to containing the spread of the virus. What we thought was “normal” before the pandemic was already a crisis and so returning to it cannot be an option.

Despite the persistent climate denialism in some policy circles, by now it is clear to the majority across the world that climate change is happening as a result of human activity – namely industrial production.

In order to continue producing – and being able to declare that their economy is growing – humans are harvesting the natural resources of the planet – water, fossil fuels, timber, land, ore, etc – and plugging them into an industrial cycle which puts out various consumables (cars, clothes, furniture, phones, processed food etc) and a lot of waste.

This process depletes the natural ability of the environment to balance itself and disrupts ecological cycles (for example deforestation leads to lower CO2 absorption by forests), while at the same time, it adds a large amount of waste (for example CO2 from burned fossil fuels). This, in turn, is leading to changes in the climate of our planet.

This same process is also responsible for COVID-19 and other outbreaks. The need for more natural resources has forced humans to encroach on various natural habitats and expose themselves to yet unknown pathogens.

At the same time, the growth of mass production of food has created large-scale farms, where massive numbers of livestock and poultry packed into megabarns. As socialist biologist Rob Wallace argues in hisbookBig Farms Make Big Flu, this has created the perfect environment for the mutation and emergence of new diseases such as hepatitis E, Nipah virus, Q fever, and others.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)estimatesthat three out of four new infectious diseases come from human-animal contact. The outbreaks ofEbola and other coronaviruses such as MERS, for instance, were triggered by a jump from animal to human in disturbed natural habitats.

In the case of COVID-19, it is suspected that the virus was transmitted to humans at a “wet market” in the city of Wuhan, where wildlife was being sold.

The mass-scale breeding of wild animals, including pangolins, civet cats, foxes, wild geese, and boar among many others is a$74bn industryin China and has been viewed as a get-rich-quick scheme by its rural population.

The origin of the virus makes it a perfect example of how the way capitalism commodifies life to turn it into profit can directly endanger human life. In this sense, the ongoing pandemic is the product of unrestrained capitalist production and consumption patterns and is very much part of the deleterious environmental changes it is causing.

The failure to contain it is also due to the capitalist drive of the global economy. In the United States, some haveclaimedthat profit losses from the freezing of economic activity are not worth closing the country for business for more than 15 days.

The World Bank Group has also recentlystatedthat structural adjustment reforms will need to be implemented to recover from COVID-19, including requirements for loans being tied to doing away with “excessive regulations, subsidies, licensing regimes, trade protection…to foster markets, choice, and faster growth prospects.”

Doubling down on neoliberal policies which encourage the unrestrained abuse of resources would be a catastrophic prospect in a post-COVID-19 world. Thesuspensionof environmental laws and regulations in the US is already a frightening sign of what returning to “normal” means for the establishment.

Although both COVID-19 and climate change are rooted in the same abusive economic behaviour and both have proven to be deadly for humans, governments have seen them as separate and unconnected phenomena and have therefore responded rather differently to them.

The vast majority of countries around the world – albeit with varying degrees of delay – have taken strict measures to curb the movement and gathering of people in order to contain the virus, even at the expense of economic growth.

The same has not happened with climate change. Current climate change measures have taken little heed of the scale and progression of the environmental changes we are experiencing. Climate changedoes not followfour-year election cycles or five-year economic plans. It does not wait for 2030 or 2050 Sustainable Development targets.

Various aspects of climate change progress at different speeds and in different locations and although for some of us these changes might not be obvious or palpable, they are happening. There are also certain thresholds which if crossed will cause change to be irreversible – whether in greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, the loss of insect populations or the melting of thepermafrost.

And while we do not get daily updates on the death toll caused by climate change, as we do with COVID-19, it is much deadlier than the virus.

Global warming of 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levelscould easilylead to a series of catastrophic outcomes. It could severely affect our ability to produce food by decreasing the fertility of soils, intensifying droughts, causing coastal inundations, increasing the loss of pollinators, etc. It could also cause severe heatwaves across the world, which have already proven increasingly deadly both in terms ofhigh temperaturesand thewildfires they cause, as well as more extreme weather phenomena like hurricanes.

Pursuing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, carbon offsetting schemes, incremental eco-efficiencies, vegan diets for the wealthy and other similar tacticswill not stopclimate change because they do not discourage mass industrial production and consumption but simply shift their emphasis. Such approaches will never work because they do not entail the necessary radical change of our high-powered lives that is required to force us to slow down and reduce our emissions.

The rapid response to COVID-19 around the world illustrates the remarkable capacity of society to put the emergency brake on “business-as-usual” simply by acting in the moment. It shows that we can take radical action if we want to.

Lockdowns across the world have already resulted in a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants. In China, for instance, the lockdown caused carbon dioxide todropby at least 25 percent and nitrogen dioxide by 37 percent.

Yet, this temporary decrease in greenhouse gases should not be a cause for celebration. The fact is that as a result of the lockdowns, millions of people have already lost their jobs and billions will probably struggle amid the economic downturn the outbreak is causing.

While some have called for climate change to be just as drastic as the one undertaken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it should not be. We need ajust climate transitionwhich ensures the protection of the poor and most vulnerable and which is integrated into our pandemic response. This would not only reverse the climate disaster we are already living in but also minimise the risk of new pandemics like the current one breaking out.

The just climate transition should involve economic reforms to introduce “planned degrowth” that puts the wellbeing of people over profit margins. The first step towards that is ensuring the stimulus packages that governments are announcing across the world are not wasted on bailing out corporations.

We must avoid at all costs a situation where unscrupulous big businesses and state actors are allowed free reign to reinforce appalling global inequality while the rest of civil society is quarantined at home.

We should demand that government funds are instead allocated to decentralised renewable energy production in order to start implementing the Green New Deal and create new meaningful jobs amid the post-COVID-19economic crisis.In parallel, we should ensure the provision of universal healthcare and free education, the extension of social protection for all vulnerable populations and the prioritisation of affordable housing.

The current response to COVID-19 could help usher in some of these changes. It could get us accustomed to lifestyles and work patterns that minimise consumption. It could encourage us to commute and travel less, reduce household waste, have shorter work weeks, and rely more on local supply chains – i.e. actions that do not hurt the livelihoods of the working classes but shift economic activity from a globalised to a more localised pattern.

Obviously, the conditions surrounding COVID-19 are not ideal, but the rapid and urgent actions in response to the virus and the inspiring examples of mutual aid also illustrate that society is more than capable of acting collectively in the face of grave danger to the whole of humanity.

Climate change,‘Delay means death’: New climate report issues stark warnings,"Climate change is upon us and humanity is far from ready, the United Nations climate science panel warned in a major report on Monday.

Noting nearly half the world’s population was already vulnerable to increasingly dangerous climate impacts, the report called for drastic action on a huge scale.

Climate change is likely going to make the world sicker, hungrier, poorer and way more dangerous by 2040 with an “unavoidable” increase in risks, and there remained only “a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all”, said the report.

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) study on Monday said if human-caused global warming was not limited to just another couple tenths of a degree, an Earth now struck regularly by deadly heat, fires, floods and drought in future decades will degrade in 127 ways – with some being “potentially irreversible”.

It pressed governments to quickly cut heat-trapping carbon emissions.

“Adaptation saves lives,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said with the report’s release. “As climate impacts worsen – and they will – scaling up investments will be essential for survival… Delay means death.”

The 3,675-page report is the latest in a series by the IPCC detailing the global consensus on climate science. This report, however, focused on how nature and societies are being affected and what they can do to adapt.

Children today who may still be alive in the year 2100 are going to experience four times more climate extremes than they do now even with only a few more tenths of a degree of warming over today’s heat.

But if temperatures increase nearly two more degrees Celsius from now (3.4 degrees Fahrenheit), they would feel five times the floods, storms, drought and heatwaves, according to the collection of scientists at the IPCC.

Already, at least 3.3 billion people’s daily lives “are highly vulnerable to climate change” and 15 times more likely to die from extreme weather, the report said.

Large numbers of people are being displaced by worsening weather extremes. And the world’s poor are being hit by far the hardest, it said. More people are going to die each year from heatwaves, diseases, extreme weather, air pollution and starvation because of global warming, the report added.

“Inequality is at the heart of today’s climate crisis – in the little over100 days since COP26, the richest 1 percent of the world’s population have emitted much more carbon than the population of Africa does in an entire year,” said Nafkote Dabi from the UK-based charity Oxfam.

“People living in the most affected countries do not need this report to tell them that the climate has changed. The highest price is already being paid.”

Mohamed Adow, from the climate think-tank Power Shift Africa, said: “This IPCC report is a fire alarm for the planet. As a species we are currently failing to adapt to this changing world. Or more accurately, the rich, polluting, global north has changed the planet through fossil fuel burning and is now refusing to help those suffering the effects.”

How many people die depends on how much heat-trapping gas from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas gets spewed into the air and how the world adapts to an ever-hotter world, the scientists said.

“Climate change is killing people,” said co-author Helen Adams of King’s College London. “Yes, things are bad, but actually the future depends on us, not the climate.”

By 2050, a billion people will face coastal flooding risk from rising seas, the report said. More people will be forced out of their homes from weather disasters, especially flooding, sea level rise and tropical cyclones.

If warming exceeds a few more tenths of a degree, it could lead to some areas becoming uninhabitable, including some small islands, said report co-author Adelle Thomas of the University of Bahamas and Climate Analytics.

And eventually in some places it will become too hot for people to work outdoors, which will be a problem for raising crops, said report co-author Rachel Bezner Kerr of Cornell University.

Guterres blasted world powers for a “criminal” abdication of leadership.

“Nearly half of humanity is living in the danger zone – now. Many ecosystems are at the point of no return – now,” said Guterres.

“This abdication of leadership is criminal. The world’s biggest polluters are guilty of arson of our only home.”

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it is possible for world leaders to work together to tackle the crisis.

“The global response to COVID-19 proves that governments can act decisively and drastically in the face of imminent global threats,” said Secretary General Jagan Chapagain.

“We need the same energy and action to combat climate change now, and we need it to reach the most climate-vulnerable communities across the world so that they have the tools and funding to anticipate and manage risks.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/28/climate-change-could-make-world-sicker-poorer-un-report
Climate change,Of climate change and Kenya’s rains,"Kenya’s woes have just increased after a dam burst in Nakuru on Wednesday evening.

The area downstream was densely populated and, as homes were swept away, at least 10 people were killed.









Dozens remain unaccounted for, and 500 families have been affected.

WesternKenyahas been particularly badly hit by landslides and floods during this season of the “long rains”.

Discussions have been ongoing about the inadequacy of infrastructure and building in vulnerable areas; nevertheless, rains have been heavier than average.

As the sun moves north with the change of season, so the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) follows.

This is the low-pressure belt that encircles the earth near the equator, bringing thunderstorms and moving the wet season north and south of the equator.

It is this movement of the sun that triggers the wet season, but other factors determine how much rain will fall.

In the case of Kenya and its neighbours in East Africa, the temperature of the Indian Ocean is the major factor.

Over the past few years, the warmth of the surface layer of this ocean has increased more than that of any other.

This is almost certainly due to climate change and its effect on the flow of the slow-moving ocean currents that transport heat from the tropics to the temperate regions.

Direct measurement of the ocean surfaces is done by thermometer and satellite.

NASA’s most recent evaluation shows that for 1,000km off the coast of Somalia and Kenya, the temperature at the surface of the Indian Ocean is about 1.5C higher than average.

That equates to a larger amount of energy, or warm water, attempting to evaporate into the air above, which in turn makes showers and thunderstorms more vigorous.

More rain will fall out of every storm, and the result will be a wetter-than-average rainy season, for some.

Western Kenya benefited during this season, with the inevitable consequences.

Climate change,Marriage of survival: Will climate change mean more child brides?,"After Cyclone Idai battered southernMalawilast year, the hotline Weston Msowoya manages was flooded with calls. They were reporting cases of young girls being married off in the tented camps hastily established by the United Nations Refugee Agency and other aid groups to house some 94,000 people displaced by one of the deadliest storms to ever hit the southern hemisphere.

By the time it had subsided, more than 1,000 people in three countries were dead. Some 1.85 million people needed support in Mozambique alone – from housing to food to healthcare, particularly in the port city of Beira, a staggering 90 percent of whichhad been destroyed. In Malawi, Msowoya was watching another tragedy unfold: he recorded 74 child marriages just in the camps he was able to reach (others were blocked because swathes of the country were under water).









It was double the number of underage brides he normally saw as executive director of the Centre for Community and Youth Development, a nonprofit in the capital, Lilongwe that monitors child marriage through community outreach activities that include a hotline advertised through word-of-mouth, pamphlets, and door-to-door visits. While marriage before age 18 was outlawed in Malawi last year, nearly 50 percent of girls in the country wed earlier.

“It’s heartbreaking. Imagine the trauma they’re going through,” said Msowoya, thinking of his 11-year-old daughter, the same age as some of the girls married after the cyclone. “They take men as their only hope of survival.”

Thanks to climate change, extreme weather events like Cyclone Idai will likely ramp up dramatically in the coming years, including more devastating flooding from rising sea levels and storms with unprecedented severity. Droughts have already increased in frequency and intensity, particularly in Africa. A growing body ofevidenceis showing that what Msowoya observed is not an anomaly: the pernicious effects of climate change are increasing child marriage.

“When there is a crisis, when people really feel that they have a threat to their survival, that’s when there is a push to get your daughter married off because parents feel that they’re not able to support them,” explained Nitya Rao, a professor of gender and development at the University of East Anglia. “It’s best for me to get my daughters married off sooner because I can’t take care of them and they’re not safe,” she added, explaining how parents reason through their difficult decision.

As the effects of climate change worsen – as is expected – parents in the global south will be forced into this position more often. Many researchers believe that Africa will be the continenthithardest by the effects of climate change. Poor countries that have contributed the least to the greenhouse gases causing climate change are already taking some of the hardesteconomichits from climate-related disasters.

Every year, 12 million underage girls get married; one in five girls get married before adulthood, according to Girls Not Brides, an international nonprofit working to end child marriage. The practice is most common in sub-Saharan Africa where almost four in 10 girls are married before age 18, followed closely by South Asia – two continents where many are already struggling to survive the effects of climate change.

It is a practice, however, that cuts across cultures and religions and occurs everywhere in the world – including the United States. It is associated with a host of negative effects, from cutting girl’s education short, to increasing their risk of domestic violence, to their likelihood of experiencing complications in childbirth and the chances that their children will die in infancy.

The practice isdecreasingglobally, but like many women’s rights gains – such as reduced maternal mortality and increased primary school attendance rates – there is growing evidence around the world that shows climate change is threatening how long that will hold true.

“This is a place affected by river erosion,” the parents of a Bangladeshi girl named Azima told her, explaining why she had to marry at 13, according toHuman Rights Watch. “If the river takes our house it will be hard for you to get married so it’s better if you get married now,” they said.

In Mozambique, Majuma Juliotoldjournalists her uncle’s crop failures forced him to marry her off at 15. “It was because of the sun. There was too much sun and the rain was not falling enough. His production started to decrease three years before the marriage,” she said. “It used to rain for two months, but after a while, it started coming less and less.”

Marrying off an underage daughter during a climate-related disaster can mean there is one less mouth to feed or parents may believe that it will protect girls from the increased risk of sexual exploitation, said Rachel Yates, the head of learning at Girls Not Brides.Studiesshow that droughts increase the likelihood of women and girls being forced into trading sex for food or money and that when displaced they are at a higher risk of rape. Dowry or bride price – a payment of cash or goods often made to a bride’s family by the groom’s family – can also provide a desperately needed infusion of cash during lean times.

Early marriage is not the only damaging effect climate change has on poor women and girls. Last month, astudyby the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found that environmental degradation can lead to an increase in sexual assault, domestic violence, and forced prostitution. Rao’s research analysed the impact of climate change across Asia and Africa and found that it is decreasing women’s agency, diminishing their typically already reduced control over finances and work. In fact, women and children are 14 times more likely than men to die in natural disasters, including because they are more likely to be undernourished, they are often caretakers weighed down with infants, and because they are less likely to know how to swim.

Redistribute income so that poor parents don't have to feel like they have to choose between starving everyone or starving one person, which will usually be the girl.

byBelinda Archibong

One thing that this growing research is helping with is a reframing of the global understanding of child marriage. Instead of a barbarous tradition practised by regressive cultures, it is a Sophie’s Choice forced upon poor parents who have run out of options – and whose choices will continue to diminish with climate change.

“Parents all love their children equally but when they’re resource-constrained, they are trying to make the best possible choices to improve wellbeing within their households,” said Belinda Archibong, assistant professor of economics at Barnard who is studying the phenomenon. “If I’m going to experience this huge shock from climate change and I’m trying to figure out how to invest my scarce resources, I am going to invest in my son.”

The reality is that men make more money – parents know that investing in them could bring life-saving returns.

This hints at another misstep, which is understanding women and girls in oversimplified terms.

“We almost see them as if they have no choice, they’re just victims of circumstance,” said Rao. “Women exercise some independence and strategic thinking in what might be best in terms of their outcome, even within their constrained choices. We have to look at women as conscious people.”

This misconception will inhibit efforts to solve the problem, said Rao – as will a lack of research. Currently, a lot of what we know is qualitative, explained Yates, based on the observations of activists like Msowoya.

Archibong is helping bolster the evidence base by working backwards. She studied Niger’s 1986 meningitis epidemic, a disease that spikes in dry seasons, and found that the outbreak pushed families to marry their daughters off early because they needed the bride price to cope with medical expenses, which also cut girls’ education short. It is evidence, she said, that suggests that as climate change exacerbates disease outbreaks and extreme weather, gender gaps could increase.

Despite these bleak predictions, Archibong remains optimistic about interventions – especially if they are done now while the worst effects of warming are still nascent.

“Redistribute income so that poor parents don’t have to feel like they have to choose between starving everyone or starving one person, which will usually be the girl,” said Archibong, who advocates for gender-conscious taxation systems that incentivise companies to pay men and women equally, or remove taxes that make sanitary products more expensive.

Another method that has shown some success is cash transfers – regular payments to poor families to reduce poverty and create a safety net in times of crises. In Malawi, one cash transfer programme found that girls were less likely to drop out of school and, if they had already dropped out, their rates of early pregnancy and marriage decreased.

Yates says it is important to pair economic support with social intervention and points to a very successful Population Council programme in Ethiopia that paired community discussions about the effects of child marriage, school supplies for girls, and a goat for families who kept their daughters unmarried for the duration of the programme.

“There’s no one silver bullet, it’s a combination of interventions that seem to be making the difference,” said Yates.

Ultimately, however, piecemeal interventions will be insufficient alone.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that there are just more than 10 years left to stop warming over 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), after which the kind of droughts and flooding that lead to child marriage will increase in frequency and severity. To do this will require cutting carbon emissions by almost half by 2030 and entirely by 2050.

It will also require that the wealthy countries responsible for climate change contribute to mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries cope with the effects – including preparation for natural disasters and increasing child marriage.

For now, Msowoya says that the seasonal flooding has started in Malawi, including January flash floods that affected upwards of 600 houses. The worst damage even reached the capital city of Lilongwe, a phenomenon Msowoya said was once unheard of.

As families scramble for shelter, he said calls to his hotline reporting child marriages are again increasing. In addition to fielding calls, Msowoya is also helping to pay school fees if families cannot keep up, educating communities about the dangers of child marriage, and bringing in law enforcement when all else fails.

“We just need more time, if we had more time we could arrange things. We cannot manage this situation alone,” he said. “If we do, we should expect the worst.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/2/19/marriage-of-survival-will-climate-change-mean-more-child-brides
Climate change,Afghanistan: Caught between climate change and global indifference,"The world is facing a climate crisis, and few nations are feeling its impact more acutely than Afghanistan. It is currentlyranked seventh on the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Indexof countries most vulnerable and least prepared to adapt to climate change. Afghanistan’s population is caught in a vicious cycle of floods, droughts, cold and heatwaves, and food insecurity. For a country with the11th lowest contributionsper capita to global carbon emissions, the scale of the consequences it faces is a tragic injustice.

In 2024, Afghanistan experienced severe flooding that devastated vital agricultural land in the northern provinces, and hundreds of people were killed. Before this, the country was ravaged by drought for three consecutive years. Crops were destroyed, leavingmillions of peoplewithout their primary source of income and food. And yet, despite the increasingly visible impact of climate change on the Afghan people, the country has been excluded from representation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – the primary mechanism for global climate cooperation – since the Taliban takeover in August 2021. Major sources of funding for climate adaptation have also been suspended.









At the UN Climate Change Conference COP29, the country is once again excluded from the negotiations. However, in a positive step towards inclusion, Afghanistan’s National Environment Protection Agency has beeninvited as a guest of the host countryand will hopefully be given the opportunity to present Afghanistan’s updated climate action plan. The country is also represented by delegates from two Afghan civil society organisations accredited as observers.

To withhold climate assistance is to punish the Afghan population for the acts of its leaders. The consequences are being borne by the people, not the de facto authorities. Afghanistan is being denied access to the Green Climate Fund, a crucial source of financing for developing nations to adapt to the effects of climate change. This exclusion strikes directly at the most vulnerable in Afghanistan and occurs at a time when international support to Afghanistan in general is rapidly decreasing.

The need for intervention is urgent. A total12.4 millionpeople are experiencing acute food insecurity, and four million people, including 3.2 million children under five years old, are suffering from acute malnutrition,according to the World Food Programme (WFP).Farmers need sustainable irrigation systems and more resilient crops, and communities need stronger disaster preparedness. Without these investments, poverty will deepen, and millions of people will face an even more severe humanitarian crisis. Women and children who are already bearing the brunt of food insecurity will suffer the most. Agriculture employs more women than any other economic sector in the country, and by excluding Afghanistan from climate financing, the international community is in fact punishing those it has vowed to protect.

The reluctance among predominately Western governments to engage with the Taliban should not come at the expense of the Afghan people. Experts and NGOs have proposed concrete strategies to ensure that climate funding reaches the Afghan people without legitimising the Taliban, e.g. through partnerships of international and national NGOs. The international community must listen to their recommendations and commit to finding constructive, long-term strategies to provide support.

The science is clear: if nothing is done, Afghanistan’s problems with drought and flooding will only worsen. Afghanistan had the highest number of children displaced by extreme weather in 2023, more than 700,000,according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.Just last month, theWFP warnedthat the persistence of La Nina weather patterns through winter 2024 will likely lead to less rain and snow in Afghanistan, jeopardising the next wheat harvest and pushing even more people towards hunger.

Climate change knows no borders, and the international community must demonstrate solidarity with the most vulnerable. We cannot afford to turn our backs on Afghanistan. Every day of inaction deepens Afghanistan’s climate disaster.

Climate change,Climate change and ‘smart seeds’ in Africa,"Southern Africa is undergoing the worst drought in more than three decades. More than 30 million people in South Africa, Malawi, and my home country Zimbabwe are facing hunger.

While this year’s drought is largely attributed to the El Nino effect, rains have been increasingly erratic over the past two decades.









This could be the new normal as climate change models forecast less rainfall and more extreme weather for much of East and Southern Africa.

Moreover, expertsprojectthat we may be entering a time of global weather uncertainty, or a “dark age”.









Recently I have seen numerous images of smallholder farmers standing helplessly next to wilted crops, dying cattle, and sun-scorched earth.

Having grown up on a small farm in rural Zimbabwe, I know full well how mother nature can destroy livelihoods for one of the world’s most vulnerable populations – smallholder farmers. I also recognise the look on many of those farmers’ faces: helplessness.

Yet, the narrative does not always have to end badly. Plant breeders, working through publicly funded research institutes, are developing new crop varieties with traits that allow them to withstand extreme weather – and not just drought, but also flooding, and frost.

People like me who work in agriculture call them “climate-smart” crops, because they offer a fast and affordable way for farmers to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.

Nothing can fully protect crops from extreme weather. Crops still need water to grow, but not too much of it. Climate-smart seed can reduce the impact of extreme weather, but it cannot to eliminate it.

by

For a number of reasons, such as restrictive seed laws and government monopolies, lack of money and a limited number of rural seed outlets, many smallholder farmers in Africa still rely on seed from outdated seed varieties saved over many generations.

That may sound quaintly self-reliant. But actually, most of these saved seeds are for crops that long ago became vulnerable to pests and disease and produce poor yields even when the rains do come.

Less than 30 percent of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa use improved seed that has recently undergone a formal breeding process.

But it does not have to be that way.

Consider theDrought-Tolerant Maize for Africa(DTMA) project, which was launched in 2007 and has been implemented in 13 African countries.

This partnership of national and international agricultural research institutions has to date released about 200 distinct drought-tolerant maize varieties.

The new varieties are bred to match growing conditions in a particular region and, along with drought tolerance, their yields are equal to or higher than other commercially available varieties.

In other words, they offer some protection against drought without sacrificing yield.

Farmers are noticing the difference and voting with their wallets. DTMA varieties have been adopted in each of the 13 target countries.

In Nigeria and Zambia, two of the drought-tolerant varieties had become the most popular commercial varieties by 2013. This is especially impressive given how slowly most smallholder farmers adopt new varieties.

Breeders are also working on the other extreme, developing crops for when climate change produces heavy rains.

TheInternational Rice Research Institutehas developed rice varieties that can withstand being submerged under water for two weeks.

Rice varieties with the so-called “scuba” gene are currently being grown by more than five million farmers in Asia. The trait is now being transferred into popular varieties in Africa.

For legumes, increased precipitation often results in root rot – a disease that that significantly lowers yields.

OPINION: Eradicating poverty in Africa

The Pan-African Bean Research Alliance has released more than 450 new bean varieties since 1996 (PDF). All of these varieties were bred to be more resilient to extreme weather while offering higher yielding and better nutrition than their ancestors.

Farmers planting the improved bean varieties in Rwanda have seen yields rise 53 percent, while productivity among farmers using the beans in Uganda has increased by about 60 percent (PDF).

For the sceptics, it should be noted that none of the technologies cited above has anything to do with genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

Moreover, they were all produced by public research institutions and commercialised by small, locally owned seed companies.

The benefits of improved seed are not new. Growing up in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe during the 1980s, rain was both abundant and consistent.

For many families in my village – including mine – the adoption of hybrid maize varieties transformed rural livelihoods from mere subsistence to surplus production. I owe my education, and consequent escape from poverty, to improved seed varieties.

OPINION: How Africa can feed itself in the face of climate change

Nothing can fully protect crops from extreme weather. Crops still need water to grow, but not too much of it. Climate-smart seed can reduce the impact of extreme weather, but it cannot eliminate it.

Further, smallholder farmers in Africa face many other challenges, such as depleted soils, limited access to extension services, high post-harvest losses and poor access to markets. Those problems cannot be solved by improved seed alone.

However, improved seed offers perhaps the cheapest way for farmers to adapt to climate change because farmers can use the seed without any need for additional training.

Moreover, while most agricultural technologies favour big commercial farms, improved seed is scale-neutral – it can be used with the same efficiency on big or small farms.

It is wrong to imagine that African farmers are reluctant to adopt the new breed of climate smart crops. With rapid uptake of mobile phones, Africa has demonstrated an appetite for adopting useful technologies.

Yet, while almost every farmer has a mobile phone, the continent lags behind in an area that is most critical for survival – agricultural productivity.

We live in a fast-changing world. All farmers now have to produce more food and fibre with fewer natural resources than they had in the past – while facing new challenges from extreme weather, along with an increase in plant pests and diseases.

These challenges are particularly hard on smallholder farmers, which is why they need to be equipped with effective, affordable technologies that are easy to use.

For small farmers – especially those facing extreme weather changes, it doesn’t get much easier than improved seed.

Climate change,Too dry to thrive: Climate change spurs Mexicans to change crops,"At least 9,000 years ago, humans began domesticating corn for the first time near Tehuacan, in the centralMexicanstate of Puebla, laying the foundation for permanent settlements in the Americas.

But in the past few years, more frequent and longer droughts have forced many farmers in the area to give up corn and other cereals in favour of alternatives requiring less water, such as pistachio nuts and cactuses.

Agricultural experts predict parts of Mexico will feel the effects ofclimate changemore than many countries, not least because its location – between two oceans and straddling the Tropic of Cancer – exposes it to weather volatility.

Sol Ortiz-Garcia, director of theagricultureministry’s climate change group, noted that 75 percent of Mexico’s soil is already considered too dry to cultivate crops. In regions such as Tehuacan, temperatures may rise more than the global average.

“We know there are areas where the increase is going to be greater. That will obviously affect rain patterns, and in turn, agriculture and food security,” Ortiz-Garcia said.

The area under corn cultivation in Tehuacan decreased 18 percent to about 40,000 hectares between 2015 and last year, shows a Reuters news agency calculation using statistics by the agriculture ministry, outstripping a nationwide decline.

In the five years before that, the area planted with corn had been slowly increasing in Tehuacan. Nationally, the area under corn cultivation declined four percent from 2015 to 7.4 million hectares last year.

While factors leading farmers to switch crops are complex, in Tehuacan farmers and local officials describe a fast-changing climate as a leading cause. Mexico’s rainy season last year was the driest since 2011, which in turn was one of the driest on record, numbers from the country’s national water agency showed.

Climate change is expected to cause substantial declines in yields of corn globally, especially in the tropics, concluded a 2018 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.

There may be exceptions. The corn belt in theUSMidwest is so vast that one recent study concluded the expanses of lush fields were actually helping increase rainfall locally and also cut temperatures, thus allowing even more corn to be grown.

Under this model, intensive farming meant more moisture being released into the atmosphere from plants on a scale great enough to create more rainfall. The greater humidity also contributed to summers up to one degree Celsius cooler, concluded the study, by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In Tehuacan, however, conditions are fast changing for the worse. In a field where dried-out plants have been lingering in the dust since the last drought, farmer Porfirio Garcia, holding a stunted cob, was struggling to make sense of it all.

Corn has for thousands of years been a symbol of Mexican pride, a staple of local and national cuisine from tortillas to tamales and the backbone of civilizations that gave rise to modern Mexico. But climate change has jeopardised that.

Garcia, who has 12 children, half of them working with him on the farm, recalls how one hectare in some years yielded as many as four tonnes (8,800lbs) of corn. In the past five years, he said, with luck that hectare yielded 700kg (1,543lbs).

“The corn harvest has shrunk because in the months of June, July, August and September there was no rain,” said Garcia, 59, who uses ancestral farming techniques to grow corn, beans and pumpkin, an ancient system called a “milpa”. “Our lives center on corn, so what do we do without it?”

Eusebio Olmedo, director of rural development, agriculture and livestock in Tehuacan, recalls that it began to get hotter at the turn of the millennium. Having worked in the department for five years, Olmedo said the area used to be characterised by a “very pleasant, very benevolent” climate.

Last year was the warmest on record in the state of Puebla – where Tehuacan is located – with thermometers reaching an average maximum temperature of 26.8 Celsius (80 F). In 1985, the first year that state records were available, Puebla registered an average maximum temperature of 24.7 Celsius (76 F).

A 2016 study commissioned by the environment ministry and backed by the United Nations Development Programme concluded that climate change in Mexico will mean less rain, lower yields for basic grains such as corn, beans and wheat, as well as “unexpected effects on food security”.

“When rain patterns change, agriculture becomes risky,” Olmedo said.

Mexican corn farmers have suffered major shocks in the past – most notably the arrival of cheap imports from the US under the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s. In the north of Mexico, where large cornfields are irrigated, climate change may initially have little impact, studies show.

But in the south, where the oldest corn strains on Earth are grown using traditional methods without irrigation, the changing rain patterns and temperatures are already being felt. Agricultural consulting group GCMA estimates Mexican corn production will continue to decline in 2020, and that corn imports mainly from the US will reach a record 18 million tonnes.

Mexico is now the world’s second-largest corn importer thanks to a reliance on US grain for animal feed. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador calls that “a contradiction”, and has implemented programmes to boost national production.

Garcia, however, chose to diversify into other crops, planting 300 trees of pistachio, a desert plant that can withstand temperatures between minus 10C (14F) and 40C (104F).

Nearby farmer Natalio De Santiago also abandoned the corn that he, his father and his grandfather used to plant for other crops that require less water. Those include maguey, a raw ingredient for mezcal, a Mexican liquor.

“I stopped sowing [corn] because the weather is changing,” said De Santiago, 56. “Now I plant maguey because it needs less water.”

Wearing a cowboy hat to shield his face from the sun, he said he irrigates 400 maguey plants every month with a litre of water each. When he planted corn, he said, his crops needed four months of rain.

Others in the area gave up agriculture altogether and sold land to real estate developers. In an attempt to stop this trend, local authorities developed a bank of native corn seeds that are more resistant to pests and that need less water.

“We have to adapt to climate change, and these are the best varieties to recover food self-sufficiency,” Olmedo said of the seeds.

Other government measures meant to help farmers adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change include agricultural insurance, alternative crops and campaigns to reduce agricultural burning.

“It’s very difficult to reverse the tendency to increase CO2 [carbon dioxide] in the atmosphere,” said the agricultural ministry’s Ortiz-Garcia. “That’s why we’re prioritising adaptation.”

Climate change,Global warming bigger threat than coronavirus: Red Cross,"The world should react with the same urgency to climate change as is to the coronavirus crisis, the Red Cross says, warning that global warming poses a greater threat than COVID-19.

Even as the pandemic rages, climate change is not taking a break from wreaking havoc, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said in a report.

In its report on global catastrophes since the 1960s, the Geneva-based organisation pointed out that the world had been hit by more than 100 disasters – many of them climate-related – since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic in March.

More than 50 million people had been affected, it said.

“Of course, the COVID is there, it’s in front of us, it is affecting our families, our friends, our relatives,” IFRC Secretary-General Jagan Chapagain told a virtual news conference.

“It’s a very, very serious crisis the world is facing currently,” he said of the pandemic, which has already killed more than 1.3 million people.

But, he warned, the IFRC expects “climate change will have a more significant medium and long term impact on the human life and on Earth”.

And while it looks increasingly likely that one or several vaccines would soon become available against COVID-19, Chapagain stressed that “unfortunately, there is no vaccine for climate change”.

Global efforts to tackle climate change are currently failing to protect the people in greatest need, according to IFRC’s World Disasters Report 2020.👉https://t.co/YYoTC77Xxp#WorldDisastersReportpic.twitter.com/V1WuPMBxji

— IFRC (@ifrc)November 17, 2020



When it comes to global warming, he warned, “it will require a much more sustained action and investment to really protect the human life on this Earth”.

The frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate-related events have been steadily climbing since the 1960s, said the IFRC.

In 2019 alone, the world was hit by 308 natural disasters – 77 percent of them climate or weather-related – killing some 24,400 people.

The number of climate and weather-related disasters has surged by nearly 35 percent since the 1990s, IFRC said, calling it a “deadly development”.

Weather and climate-related disasters have killed more than 410,000 people over the past decade, most of them in poorer countries, with heatwaves and storms proving the most deadly, the report said.

Faced with this threat, which “literally threatens our long-term survival”, IFRC called on the international community to act with the urgency required.

“These disasters are already on the doorstep in every country around the world,” it said.

“With challenges like these, international solidarity is not only a moral responsibility but also the smart thing to do.

“Investing in resilience in the most vulnerable places is more cost-effective than to accept continued increases in the cost of humanitarian response, and contributes to a safer, more prosperous and sustainable world for everyone,” it added.







The IFRC estimated that around $50bn would be needed annually over the next decade to help 50 developing countries adapt to the changing climate.

It stressed that that amount was “dwarfed by the global response to the economic impact of COVID-19,” which has already passed $10 trillion.

It also lamented that much of the money invested so far in climate change prevention and mitigation was not going to the developing countries who are most at risk.

“Our first responsibility is to protect communities that are most exposed and vulnerable to climate risks,” Chapagain said, warning that “our research demonstrates that the world is collectively failing to do this.”

“There is a clear disconnect between where the climate risk is the greatest and where climate adaptation funding goes,” he said.

“This disconnection could very well cost lives.”

Climate change,Climate change is devastating the Global South,"Right now in India and Pakistan, a record-breaking heatwave is impacting the daily lives of nearly a billion people. Scorching temperatures are damaging wheat harvests, preventing many labourers from working outdoors, and making people vulnerable to serious health issues and even death.

Our native countries of Kenya and Bangladesh are suffering too: Northern Kenya is facing aprolonged droughtthat is putting rural communities at greater risk of starvation and last year, torrential rains left one-quarter of Bangladesh under water and destroyed the homes of millions. These are some of the latest examples of how the 3.6 billion people in developing countries arebearing the bruntof the climate crisis, and a preview of what the “new normal” will look like if the global community doesn’t immediately step up its climate action.









Given their power, wealth, and responsibility for the climate crisis, the onus is particularly on rich countries in North America and Europe to help vulnerable countries weather climate impacts – and it has never been more urgent. Despite the negligible contribution that most vulnerable countries have made to cause climate change, these countries are the most ambitious in tackling it – but they cannot fight this crisis on their own. Not only is this the moral thing to do, but it will also help minimise the challenges and costs down the road, such as disaster recovery efforts and the migration of climate refugees forced to leave their homelands as they become increasingly uninhabitable.

The decisionsadoptedat the UN’s COP26 climate negotiations last year fell far short of the expectations of vulnerable developing countries. We can’t wait any longer to act.

This week, the ACT2025 consortium (Allied for Climate Transformation by 2025), a coalition amplifying the voices of vulnerable countries in the climate negotiations,announceda call to actionfor progress at the COP27 conference in Egypt this November.

First, countries – especially G7 and G20 countries – must commit to further reducing emissions to keep the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) – the threshold scientists believe will prevent the most dangerous climate impacts – within reach. More ambitious climate pledges have lately helped the world close the warming gap from a predicted 4 degrees C (7.2 degrees F) to now 2.1 degrees C (3.8 degrees F). However, since every fraction of a degree of warming will make an enormous difference in the scale of climate impacts and their effect on the lives of the most vulnerable, the progress made so far is not enough.

Second, developed countries must deliver adequate funding to help developing nations address climate change – and make sure this funding will benefit the most vulnerable by empowering communities to pursue the adaptation solutions they need. This includes delivering $600bn by 2025, a goal that developed countries are not yet on track to achieve.

Third, countries must implement stronger adaptation measures, including coming to an agreement on a global goal on adaptation and how to track progress as well as delivering adequate, quality finance to support adaptation on the ground. Adaptation initiatives range from restoring coastal ecosystems that buffer storms to growing drought-resistant crops. Success will require governments to ensure local communities have decision-making power over adaptation efforts.

Fourth, developed countries must commit to providing finance specifically for losses and damages that are too extreme for countries and communities to adapt to. While such impacts are global in nature, they hit the most vulnerable the hardest, such as low-lying islands disappearing due to rising sea levels, farmers no longer being able to support crops due to extreme heat, or communities forced to abandon ancestral homelands that can no longer support them. This injustice must be addressed, yet so far the only governments to offer funds to help the victims suffering climate-related losses and damages have been Scotland and the Wallonia province in Belgium – both welcome contributions, but wealthier developed countries now need to take the lead.

And lastly, countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement must implement rules that will hold countries and non-state actors accountable for their commitments. This includes ensuring that governments actually have the wherewithal to achieve the goals they’ve set and that climate progress is measured accurately and transparently.

Shortly after COP27, we will be a quarter of the way through the decade that scientists agree will be critical to determine the future of life on this planet. What will the world have to show for it? Climate change is at our doorsteps, and vulnerable countries don’t have a moment to lose. The world needs to be all in, all together, to swiftly and fairly address this global crisis.

Climate change,Climate change ‘dystopian future already here’,"Climate change is causing human rights emergencies around the world, the United Nations human rights chief says, specifically highlighting Iraq’s “spiralling damage” from global warming.

Volker Turk pointed to recent examples of the “environmental horror that is our global planetary crisis”, including in Basra, Iraq, where “drought, searing heat, extreme pollution andfast-depleting supplies of freshwaterare creating barren landscapes of rubble and dust”.

“This spiralling damage is a human rights emergency for Iraq and many other countries,” Turk told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday.

“Climate change is pushing millions of people into famine. It is destroying hopes, opportunities, homes and lives. In recent months, urgent warnings have become lethal realities again and again all around the world,” he said.

“We do not need more warnings. The dystopian future is already here. We need urgent action now.”

He spoke after the leaders of the Group of 20 (G20) richest countries at the weekend backed the goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 – but failed to commit to aphase-out of fossil fuels.

The Climate Action Network announced on Monday that millions of climate protesters from around the globe will demand an exit from coal, oil and gas use as soon as possible. The series of demonstrations are to coincide with a key climate summit on September 20 in New York City, hosted by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

In view of the record global temperatures this year, Guterres last week called for much more ambition in the fight against climate changeto prevent “the worst climate chaos”.

Environmental groups – including Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion and Friends of the Earth – are behind the global climate demonstrationsexpected to start on Friday.







The 2015 Paris Agreement on fighting climate change aims to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change. To meet the pledge requires net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

To stay at 1.5C of warming, no new fossil fuel extraction projects should be launched, the International Energy Agency warned years ago. Despite pledges by governments, hydrocarbon production plans continue to be rolled out worldwide.

At last year’s UN COP27 climate summit, more than 80 countries pushed for its final statement to includea call to phase-out fossil fuels.

Yet, countries such as the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and Norway – among developed nations historically responsible for creating the current climate emergency – “have turned around and hypocritically continued developing more fossil fuels”,saidthe group Oil Change International.

A march will be held in southern Pakistan’s Sindh province, which was devastated by unprecedented flooding last year.

“We demand a phase-out of fossil fuels now,” said Farooq Tariq from the Kissan Rabita Committee, a collective of farmers in the region.

“The fossil fuel industry and its supporters bear responsibility for the climate crisis and perpetuate a predatory and destructive economic system that harms both people and the planet.”

Climate change,‘Mutual suicide’: US issues stark warning on climate change,"The United States has warned inaction by world powers on climate change is tantamount to a “mutual suicide pact” after countries such as China, India, and Russia expressed scepticism on the global security threat it posed.

John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that the Pentagon has described the climate crisis as “a threat multiplier”.

“But even though climate change has been repeatedly called ‘an existential threat’, we honestly have yet as a world to respond with the urgency required,” said Kerry.

He called the climate situation “indisputably a Security Council issue” after some nations said it had no place for discussion at the UN body.

“In fact, it is among the most complex and compelling security issues that I think we’ve ever faced.”

Failing to address climate change is “marching forward to what is almost tantamount to a mutual suicide pact”, said Kerry. “We bury our heads in the sand at our own peril. It’s urgent to treat the climate crisis as the urgent security threat that it is.”

The stance by the administration of President Joe Biden comes in stark contrast to that of former US leader Donald Trump, who pulled out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement and ignored climate policy during his four years in power.

Experts believe the world must reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner to ensure long-term warming is held to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and avoid triggering catastrophic climate tipping points.

The world has already warmed 1.2C (2.2F) since the mid-19th century and the goal now is to prevent an additional 0.3C (0.5F) of warming.







Russia, India and China said climate change should be tackled in other global forums, not at the UN’s main grouping on imminent world threats.

Russia was particularly vocal in its opposition to the discussions.

“We agree that climate change issues can exacerbate conflict. But are they really the root cause of these conflicts? There are serious doubts about this,” said Moscow’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia.

“The connection between the climate and conflicts can be looked at with regard to only certain countries and regions, talking about this in general terms and in a global context has no justification,” he added.

While Russia was committed to action against climate change, “this should be done within the framework of the mechanisms where it is dealt with by professionals”.

China’s special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua acknowledged climate change was linked to insecurity but overall issued a similar line to Russia.

“International climate cooperation should be advanced with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,” he said, in a long speech that touted China’s recent commitments, including its aim to achieve its carbon emissions peak before 2030 and achieve neutrality by 2060.

India’s environment minister, Prakash Javdekar, dismissed the idea of climate change as a driver of conflict.

However, the planet’s warming temperatures were deemed inextricably linked to global security by most countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged fellow leaders to take immediate action on the climate crisis or face worsening global instability.

“Whether you like it or not it is a matter of when, not if, your country and your people will have to deal with the security impacts of climate change,” said Johnson.

“I know that there are people around the world who will say that this is … green stuff from a bunch of tree-hugging tofu munchers and not suited to international diplomacy and international politics. I couldn’t disagree more profoundly.”

Johnson pointed to the 16 million people displaced by weather-related disasters each year, some becoming easy prey to armed groups, farmers losing another wheat harvest because of drought and switching to growing opium poppies, and girls forced to drop out of school to search for water becoming prey to human traffickers. He also cited the impacts of changing sea levels and wildfires.

Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta stressed the effect of climate and security on Africa, which he lamented “unfortunately will suffer the worst consequences of climate change despite being the least responsible for global greenhouse gases”.

He said the drought-stricken Horn of Africa, drying of the Lake Chad basin, shrinking of the Sahel and savannah grasslands “and worsening economic vulnerabilities have set in motion political, demographic, migratory dynamics that increase the threat of insurgency and violent extremism”.







The UK has committed into law a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and will host the COP26 climate summit in November in the Scottish city of Glasgow.

Kerry called the Glasgow conference “literally our last best hope to get on track and get this right”.

The United States is hosting its own summit on April 22 where it is expected to announce its renewed carbon-reduction commitments after years of disengagement under Trump.

French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, pleaded for “effective multilateralism” in the effort to limit warming, and voiced support for a German idea of appointing a special UN envoy for climate security.

Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also called for regular reporting by the UN secretary-general on the security implications of climate change.

Renowned British broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough, in a video message played before the UNSC meeting, warned “if we continue on our current path, we will face the collapse of everything that bring us our security including food, water, habitable temperatures”.

“We have left the stable and secure climatic period that gave birth to our civilization,” he said. “There is no going back.”

But Attenborough added: “If we act fast enough we can reach a new stable state,” and the UN conference in November “may be our last opportunity to make this step change”.

Climate change,Is Turkey really serious about climate change?,"Istanbul, Turkey– “They don’t care about the environment, they care about money, always money,” says Nurcan Keskin, a retired teacher as she takes a break from collecting signatures for a petition to save what Turkish climate activists say is a rare green space in this bustling metropolis of 16 million.

Home to birds and other wildlife, the 354,000-square metre (423,000-sq yard) Validebag Grove is a legally protected space, and its trees are part of the lungs of the city, absorbing greenhouse gases that cause global warming.

It is also yet another flashpoint in what seems like a constant battle between Turkey’s government and environmental activists.

For more than 100 days now, Keskin and dozens of other activists have kept watch against bulldozers and police who would like to enter the grove and begin construction to transform it into a “People’s Garden” – part of a national programme the government has said will make tens of thousands of green spaces more accessible to the public.

More than 30,000 people though, have signed a petition against that development, which includes paving over trails and building a 500-space car park.

“They are presenting this as if they want to serve people. But that’s not the case,” says Arif Belgin, another activist at the grove. “They demolish green spaces so they can put up buildings instead. This is a protected natural area, but the state is not willing to preserve it, so we come and preserve it instead.”







Environmental activism has long been an explosive fault line in an already politically polarised Turkey. Plans to replace a park in central Istanbul in 2013 set off large protests and led to the arrest of hundreds of activists.

Despite opposition from activists, authorities went ahead and built a new northern highway and what will be the world’s largest airport near Istanbul, replacing forests that were supposed to be protected as part of the city’s growth plan.

Thousands of protesters marched against a Canadian-owned gold mine project in the western province of Canakkale in 2019 that activists said cut down hundreds of thousands of trees. And a plan to dig a 45km (28-mile) long alternate to the Bosporus through Istanbul is still scheduled to go forward even as environmentalists have said it would cut through important green preserves in the city.

But in recent weeks, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who regularly accuses environmental activists of standing in the way of the country’s economic progress, has signalled what the government has said is a change in priorities.

This month, Turkey plans to fully ratifythe Paris agreementon climate change, which seeks to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the world to levels that keep global warming below two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels.

By 2030, Turkish officials say they will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 21 percent below expected levels, and by 2053, they plan to reachnet-zero emissions, meaning green spaces and other natural carbon sinks would absorb all the greenhouses gases emitted in the country.







Turkey’s planned ratification camebefore COP26, the United Nations’ major conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on climate change to be held in November.

Turkey’s Environment and Urban Planning Minister Murat Kurum told reporters on Monday that his country will establish a “Climate Council” next year to bring together stakeholders and experts from all sectors of the economy and plan how to reach net-zero emissions.

“We are increasing our sink areas. We are increasing our natural protected areas, expanding our bicycle paths and green walking paths,” Kurum said.

It is that apparent contradiction in messaging – claiming to be protecting green areas on the global stage but pushing on with projects such as the People’s Garden in cities like Istanbul – that has environmentalists in Turkey worried.

“As climate activists, for many years in Turkey we have been demanding the Paris agreement be ratified, so it is an important achievement for Erdogan to make that statement,” Emine Ozkan, co-spokesperson for Turkey’s Green Party, told Al Jazeera.

“It’s a turning point for the climate movement, but we are discussing what will happen after this.”

Turkey was one of the first countries to sign the Paris agreement in 2015, but in the years following, Ankara insisted full ratification would only happen if it was listed among other “developing” countries, a classification that would make it eligible for funds from wealthier countries to meet their climate change goals.

“The Turkish delegation submitted requests almost every year after 2015,” said Umit Sahin, coordinator of climate change studies at Sabanci University’s Istanbul Policy Center. “But of course, this was not possible, because the decision should be taken unanimously, and developing countries were not on the same page as Turkey, they did not want Turkey to become another developing country because of climate finance, mostly.”







Ankara’s objection to being locked out of financial support is justified, said Karim Elgendy, an associate fellow with Chatham House and founder of Carboun, an advocacy initiative promoting sustainability in the Middle East North Africa region.

Turkey’s economy is among the largest in the world, earning it a place among groups like the G20, but its emissions per capita, Elgendy said, are below the global average. Turkey ranks 16th in the world in terms of emissions, according to the Global Carbon Atlas, and accounts for about 1 percent of global greenhouse gasses.

Turkey’s track record on mitigating its emissions is far better than those of other countries in the Middle East.

“If you consider Turkey to be equivalent to Germany in terms of availability of technology, availability of finance, and historic responsibility for carbon emissions, then you can certainly say that Turkey has not been doing enough to reduce its emissions,” Elgendy said.

“But if you consider Turkey to be closer to developing economies, you might be forgiven to ask why is it being asked to carry the burden for historic emissions when no one is supporting it.”

Part of the reason Turkey is now ratifying the Paris agreement, Sahin said, is the realisation that it is not going to be reclassified as a developing country any time soon. But Sahin added there are also more practical reasons.

For starters, a year of floods, fires, and drought have brought the issue of climate change to the forefront of political discussions in Turkey.

A survey by Konda found 76 percent of voters thought natural disasters had become more frequent, and 87 percent of voters – including 81 percent in the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AK Party – thought global warming was a real phenomenon.

Overall, 75 percent of voters in Turkey, the survey found, were worried about climate change – a level of awareness matching, and exceeding in many cases, most European countries.

Meanwhile, a global shift away from coal has meant Turkey is rapidly replacing fossil fuels with renewables for its energy demands, which accounts for the vast majority of the country’s emissions.

About 34 percent of Turkey’s energy comes from coal today, and the country is just behind China and India in the global ranking of newly planned coal plants, according to a report from climate and energy think-tank Ember. But those new plants are highly likely to be cancelled asmajor financiers for coal such as Chinahave said they will not continue backing the fossil fuel.

Renewables have instead stepped in, with about half of the country’s energy today coming from sources such as hydro, solar, and wind.

Turkey’s shift to renewable energy is to be lauded, Elgendy said, but if it intends to meet its net-zero goal for 2053, the country needs to come up with an overall policy shift and a detailed action plan. “The announcement to fully decarbonise is great, but we don’t know how they are going to achieve it.”

The country’s energy policy, especially, said Elgendy, repeatedly stresses “energy security and energy independence” instead of cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

Though its share has declined in recent years, oil and gas still account for about one-quarter of the country’s energy mix. And Turkey is locked ina dispute in the Eastern Mediterraneanover rights to natural gas there with Greece and Cyprus, a high stakes naval standoff with the potential for a real war that could draw in Egypt, Israel, and others in the region.

That is just one of the apparent contradictions between Turkey’s global claims of fighting climate change and its domestic policies, said Koray Dogan Urbarli with the Turkish Green Party.

Government officials tout green policies in speeches, he said, but they “don’t know what kind of change is needed for that [and] what are the consequences of those changes. These are just slogans for them.”

Climate change,Why forests are the best ‘technology’ to stop climate change,"The warning from the world’s top climate scientists that carbon dioxide (CO2) will need to be removed from the atmosphere to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is both a due and dire recognition of the great task in front of us. What must not be forgotten, however, is the hope that our forests provide.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)has saidlimiting global warming to 1.5C is not only achievable but also critical, given the previously underestimated accelerating risks for every degree of warming beyond that target.









It has also suggested that the amount of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) that will be neededcan be limited by significant and rapid cuts in emissions, but also reduced energy and land demand to a few hundred gigatonnes without relying onBioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).

This means forests and land use can and must play a key role in efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees, but governments and industry too often overlook why improved forest protection, as well as forest restoration, are crucial alternative solutions to risky CDR technologies such as BECCS.

While greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and the destruction of forests and peatlands contribute heavily to climate change, the growth and restoration of forests can contribute significantly to reducing the concentration of CO2in the atmosphere.

Recentresearchsuggests that forest protection and restoration, together with other “natural climate solutions”, can provide over one-third of the climate mitigation needed between now and 2030.

The IPCC has estimated thatbetween 100 and 1,000 gigatonnes ofCO2will need to be removed from the atmosphere to meet the Paris goals. It has been broadly agreed that the most important natural “carbon sinks” are the world’s forests. To limit climate change, we must urgently adopt an holistic approach to forest and peatland protection.

This means deforestation must be halted and our remaining forests well protected, intact forests must be kept away from logging and other destructive activities, the management of used forests must change and where land is available, it must be restored with natural forests.

To allow these natural climate solutions to thrive, wildland fires, most of which are sparked by human activities and contribute to global warming, must also be reduced. The tragic and wide geographic spread of wildfires across Siberia, Europe and California during the northern hemisphere summer is a stark reminder of the threat climate change poses to our forests.

Our forests are our only natural and tested “technology” to lessen the impacts of climate change and protecting them will bring benefits that untried carbon removal technical solutions do not.

Forest protection will help communities adapt to climate change and support their livelihoods. Fires, droughts, floods, storms and their impacts can also be reduced, biodiversity protected, freshwater-cycles maintained and soil erosion prevented.

By accepting that our lands and forests are primarily needed to feed people, protect nature and protect the climate, rather than as resources for profit, areas for industrial agriculture, livestock or coal mining for example in Germany’s Hambach Forest, we can turn the tide against global warming.

The IPCC report identifies different pathways to limiting global warming to 1.5C, most of which are dependent to varying degrees on the deployment, future availability and success of more technological, but so far unproven, approaches to CDR, and, in particular, BECCS.

Deployment of BECCS would involve massive upscaling in intensive production of monoculture crops or tree plantations, leading to increased loss of natural habitats and biodiversity, threatening indigenous peoples, small farmers and local communities, squeezing land needed for food production and increasing water demand and agrochemical pollution.

Bioenergy without carbon capture and storage iscontributingto, rather than helping mitigate, climate change and there existsgreat uncertaintyaround the technical feasibility, safety, sustainability and cost of long-term geological carbon storage.

This is why we need to act on the IPCC report and re-appraise the way we view our forests.One-third of the global forest area has already been cleared for arable land, grassland, settlements and roads in the last millennium.

We can halt and reverse this trend by ending the expansion of agricultural crops, particularly for bio-energy and animal feed, into natural ecosystems. We must also embark on a dramatic change to our agricultural practices, embracing ecological agriculture andshifting to adiet less relianton meat to reduce emissions from livestock.

What is required is bold action from governments and industry to commit to forest protection and restoration while upholding the rights of indigenous people. By seizing the opportunity now to restore deforested areas and opt against false solutions such as BECCS, we can ensure our forests fulfil their critical role.

Home to millions of people, our forests offer us a path towards climate mitigation, but we have no time to waste.

Climate change,"In Sierra Leone, climate change worsens human trafficking of the poor","Freetown, Sierra Leone– Zainab – last name withheld – sits in a dimly lit office in the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown, plugs a number into her phone, and inhales sharply. A man picks up after two rings.

“I hear you are offering jobs in Lebanon,” the 29-year-old Sierra Leonean social worker tells him. “Life is so hard here, I want to get out. Can you help?”









The man gives her an address in Waterloo, a densely populated town 32km (20 miles) south of Freetown, and tells her to bring 3 million Leones ($150) as an initial downpayment. She hangs up and dials a contact at the Transnational Organised Crime Unit, a police division trained by the US embassy to catch human traffickers.

“It can be difficult to reach the perpetrator,” says Emmanuel Cole, head of the unit. “Sometimes we lure them to us by making them believe someone is interested in their programme.”

It is not the first time that Zainab has helped to set up an undercover sting. Four years ago she was trafficked to Oman. Since escaping a family home where she was forced to work for free and was sexually assaulted, she has made it her mission to help others who might also be tricked into going abroad.

“I try not to be afraid,” she says. “I know I am doing the right thing.”

Human trafficking is classed as using force, coercion or fraud to send someone to a new destination, to profit from them. While official data is scant, experts say the problem is rife in Sierra Leone.

With youth unemployment at nearly 60 percent and the majority of the population surviving on less than $3 a day, there are thousands of people for traffickers to prey on, who long for better opportunities overseas. They often target women, touting well-paid jobs in the Middle East.

“You are sold a lifestyle,” says Vani Saraswathi of Migrant-rights.org, a Gulf-based advocacy group.

The agents offer jobs as nannies, hairdressers, maids or shop assistants in countries including Lebanon, Oman, Dubai, Kuwait and Turkey. But when their clients arrive in the destination country, their passports are often seized and they are forced into unpaid labour in people’s houses. Many young women report being sexually abused.

“They said I was a slave and didn’t need to be paid,” says one woman who went to Oman to work as a maid, “when we were alone in the house, the man would have sex with me, he held a knife to my throat and said he’d cut me if I screamed”.

Those monitoring the problem say it has worsened in the last three years. “There has been an increase,” says Christos Christodoulides, head of the UN Migration Agency in Sierra Leone. “The vulnerability has increased too.”

While some victims of human trafficking manage to escape, many stay locked in gruesome situations for years. Ninety-nine percent of the 469 Sierra Leonean domestic workers in Oman, interviewed in the last two years by the non-profit Do Bold, said they had been trafficked. A third of them reported being sexually abused.

Climate change is exacerbating the problem. Sierra Leone is ranked in the top 10 percent of countries vulnerable to climate change despite having contributed just 0.003 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions since 1950.

A third of its population lives on the coast, making their homes vulnerable to worsening floods. Some of the country’s islands are going underwater, forcing residents onto ever-shrinking sandbanks.

There is a “serious increase” in the number of people who have been trafficked after their houses have been destroyed by floods or mudslides, says Sheku Bangura, who runs the Advocacy Network Against Irregular Migration (ANAIM) that supports returnee migrants and helped rescue Zainab from Oman.

Each year, flash floods tear through Freetown, ripping down houses and killing civilians. The city recorded more than 400 floods in 2021 and 2022, which resulted in hundreds of casualties. After heavy rains last summer, torrents of muddy water poured into ground floor wards at Connaught, the country’s biggest hospital, damaging equipment and putting patients at risk.

Bad harvests brought on by unpredictable rainfall are driving farmers into the city, where overcrowded settlements on precipitous hillsides are increasingly vulnerable to mudslides. In 2017, after unusually heavy rain, a mountaintop collapsed on the settlement below it, killing over 1,000 people as they slept.

Saccoh Kamara was trafficked to Dubai shortly after a mudslide tore through his house, killing his father and three-year-old son.

Early in the morning on August 14, 2017, Kamara returned from work at a construction site to find his village had been buried in mud and rubble. The mudslide happened at around 6am when his son and father had been asleep inside the house.

“We never recovered their bodies,” he says.

After a fortnight in hospital where he was treated for shock, Kamara, now 36, began to rebuild his life, moving in with a cousin on Freetown’s waterfront. When that house was also destroyed in floods—increasingly common as sea levels rise—he decided to leave Sierra Leone for good.

A trafficker promised him lucrative work on a supermarket checkout in Dubai. Instead, he was put to work, unpaid, in a frozen food warehouse. Imprisoned there for seven months, he worked around the clock, resting for just an hour at a time on the floor in a corner.

“They used shovels to hit us,” Kamara says. “When I wanted to rest they would come and beat me.”

After escaping and being deported back to Sierra Leone, Kamara started volunteering at ANAIM, Bangura’s advocacy group, trying to prevent others from falling victim to predatory traffickers.

Before leaving the police station on the back of a motorbike driven by an undercover policeman, Zainab dons a large pair of sunglasses.

“I don’t want him to remember me,” she says.

As they reach the meeting point, four more policemen, two of them armed with Kalashnikovs, wait in a van nearby.  Soon a slight man in his forties approaches Zainab on foot. She tells him she is struggling to pay school fees for her younger siblings and that she got his number from a friend, Adama – whom she knows was tricked into unpaid labour in Lebanon. The man nods sympathetically and says he can help: He sent 18-year-old Adama to Beirut last year.

This is enough for Zainab who presses the call button on her phone inside her pocket. Moments later, she turns away as the policemen rush from their hiding place to seize the trafficker, frightened he will remember her face.

Since Sierra Leone passed a new law in 2022 introducing a minimum sentence of 25 years for anyone convicted of human trafficking, dozens of agents have been arrested. However, just three have been convicted – and one of them was acquitted shortly afterwards. Traffickers often bribe their way out of jail or call on political contacts to pull strings.

In the absence of a robust justice system, “the best prevention is education so that people ask the right questions when they are offered a job”, says Saraswathi of Migrant Rights.

Yet even education carries risks. Bangura’s ANAIM hosts a weekly radio show in which returnees tell cautionary tales of being trafficked. In one episode, he implored victims to come forward with details of traffickers, implying that he already had a database of agents. The next night his office door was broken down and two computers stolen.

“I feel we are fighting an endless battle,” Bangura says. “But I have committed to fight it.”

Climate change,Climate change activists test strict Singapore protest laws,"Singapore– On 13 March, Wong J-min skipped school and headed to a glass-walled tower at the Harbourfront complex on Singapore’s west coast.

While her peers sat in their classrooms, the 18-year-old posed for a series of photos before the building housing ExxonMobil’s Singapore office, holding up messages scrawled on pieces of paper that read, “PLANET OVER PROFIT”, “SCHOOL STRIKE 4 CLIMATE”, and the tongue-in-cheek “ExxonMobil KILLS KITTENS & PUPPIES”.

The photos were shared on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, but while they fuelled some interest, did not go viral.

Wong’s small action signalled a fledging Singapore chapter of Fridays for Future – a global school strike movement founded by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg – but just over a week later, Wong found herself summoned for questioning by the police, and her phone was confiscated.









Singapore is a low-lying island that will be heavily affected by rising temperatures and sea levels caused by climate change. Yet much of its economy is also built on the fossil fuels that have been pinpointed as a major perpetrator of the crisis.

According to the country’s Economic Development Board, the energy and chemicals industrycontributedS$81 billion to Singapore’s 2015 output – almost a third of its entire manufacturing output.

“Youth feel that in spite of all that has been announced – various legislation such as the Energy Conservation Act and measures such as the carbon tax – more needs to be done,” said Melissa Low, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Energy Studies Institute.

Wong’s signs took aim at the petrochemical industry and its presence in Singapore.

Members of the world’s largest oil and gas companies, such as Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil, all have a significant presence on Jurong Island, one of the world’s largest petrochemical hubs off the southwest coast of Singapore’s main island.

ExxonMobil, already one of the largest foreign investors in Singapore, recentlyheld a virtual foundation-laying ceremonyfor the expansion of its refining and petrochemical complex.

She is not the only young Singaporean speaking out against fossil fuels, despite laws that make protest difficult.

In 2017, a group of students at Yale-NUS Collegelaunched a campaignto push the institution to divest from coal, oil and gas. Other initiatives, such as LepakInSG, organise and list activities that provide public education. In September last year, more than 1,700 Singaporeans turned up for the country’sfirst ever climate rally, organised by the new youth-led SG Climate Rally group.

On 22 March, a photo of 20-year-old Nguyen Nhat Minh holding up a placard in public saying “SG IS BETTER THAN OIL @fridays4futuresg” was posted on Fridays for Future Singapore’s Instagram account.

Nguyen says that he, like Wong, only posed for the picture before leaving.

But he has also been questioned by the police. As part of the investigation, he was escorted from the police station back to his home, where his laptop and mobile phone were seized, and officers dug through the dumpster outside his home to retrieve his cardboard sign.

Singapore's first climate strike! J Min skipped school today to call for more urgent action to be taken on climate justice. She is at harbour front because it is the office of ExxonMobil. Join the conversation on twitter @fridays4futuresg#fridays4future#climatestrikesgpic.twitter.com/mrQNvt5k8a

— Jolovan Wham (@jolovanwham)March 13, 2020



The duo also says that they were “strongly advised” by the police to take down the Fridays for Future Singapore website and social media accounts. The website has been removed, while the Twitter and Instagram accounts have been made private.

If convicted of illegal assembly, the maximum sentence is a fine of up to 5,000 Singapore dollars (US$3,500).

Under Singapore’s public order laws, there is only one park in Singapore where residents are allowed to participate in public assemblies without a permit, and even a solo protest is outlawed if the police have not first given their permission.

In 2018, performance artist Seelan Palayspent two weeks in prisonin lieu of a fine after a performance – which involved walking with a mirroroutof the park to Singapore’s parliament building – was deemed an illegal procession.

The Singapore Police Force declined to comment for this story.

Faced withdire warnings of the impact of climate change, Wong feels like the Singapore government needs to move away from fossil fuels sooner rather than later, even though she acknowledges the economic cost.

“To me, as a young person, I think it’s a trade-off that’s worth it, because I feel like … [do] you want the economy to die, or [do] you want me to die?” she told Al Jazeera.

Divesting is easier said than done. As Low points out, the energy and chemicals sector is not only an important contributor to Singapore’s economy, it also provides energy security in a country with no natural energy resources of its own.

Singapore is already looking to decarbonise the energy and chemicals sector as much as possible, Low wrote in an email to Al Jazeera.

“Even if Singapore were to completely rid itself of this sector, the question of moving away from fossil fuels and divestment is not so simple, as there’s always the risk of carbon leakage where the carbon emission simply goes elsewhere,” she said.

Wong and Nguyen’s run-in with the authorities has caused them strife at home, too.

Wong, who is preparing for her A-Level exams this year, says her father worries the investigation might hurt her future: “It’s not his fault because I guess he’s scared, because he’s never really had trouble with the police before.”

Nguyen is facing a similar situation. “[My father] went through the whole speech about his Vietnamese immigrant upbringing and how he worked his way to Singapore and … how I’m basically just throwing it all away,” he said.

This experience is familiar to many young Singaporeans venturing into activism. Kristian-Marc James Paul, a member of SG Climate Rally, says that many members have had to “constantly negotiate and navigate our parents’ fear for our safety”.

“Our parents have seen how Singaporeans, time and time again, have been punished for speaking up and they don’t want that to happen to us.”

That said, Paul said that some parents are supportive of their children’s efforts, acknowledging that their offspring are more motivated and courageous than they have been.

Police attention and parental disapproval have not deterred Nguyen, who says that he took the risk because “ultimately what happens to me isn’t as bad as what would happen to other people if we just keep going business as usual”.

Nor is he concerned about any potential threat to his future prospects.

“[Maybe] I make less money, okay … but there are people out there who will not have houses, like their islands will literally be underwater, they won’t have anything to eat.”

Although the governmentannouncedin February that Singapore will aim to halve its peak 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions some time in the second half of the century, climate activists are not satisfied.

SG Climate Rally pointed out that Singapore’s targets fall short of therecommendationby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

Since the September event, SG Climate Rally has teamed up with another group, Speak for Climate, to launchGreenwatch, a campaign that has already produced a policy brief on climate and intends to score political party manifestos according to their proposals on how to tackle climate change.

“This country focuses a lot on ‘bread-and-butter’ issues and one of the main criticisms we get is that the climate crisis is not a ‘bread-and-butter’ issue,” said Paul.

“We hope that Greenwatch will show Singaporeans that the climate crisis is indeed such an issue because it intersects with so many other concerns Singaporeans have, whether it’s cost of living, healthcare services or social inequality.”

Wong and Nguyen have been keeping an eye on social media, trying to gauge the level of support for them. They say the reaction has been fairly polarised: while some have been pleasantly surprised by the emergence of Fridays for Future in Singapore, other commenters have belittled their activism.

“One common criticism I get is, ‘Why should adults listen to children?'” Nguyen said.

“[But] no one needs to listen to us; there have been researchers [calling for action on climate change] for decades. And if we’re the first people to tell someone about it, that says more about them than it does about us.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/10/climate-change-activists-test-strict-singapore-protest-laws
Climate change,UN chief denounces ‘suicidal’ failure to tackle climate change,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has denounced a “suicidal” failure to tackle climate change and said recovery from the coronavirus pandemic could be humanity’s chance for a reset to save Earth.

His comments on Wednesday came as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in its provisional 2020 State of the Global Climate report that this year is on course to be one of the three warmest ever recorded.









“The state of the planet is broken. Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal,” Guterres said in a speech at Columbia University in New York City.

“Next year we have the opportunity to stop plunder and begin healing,” he added. “COVID recovery and our planet’s repair must be two sides of the same coin.”

Guterres called for a reduction in the use of fossil fuels and said a summit planned on December 12 for the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate change agreement should chart a new way forward.

“A new world is taking shape,” he said.

“Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes. Deserts are spreading. Wetlands are being lost. Every year, we lose 10 million hectares of forests.

“Oceans are overfished – and choking with plastic waste. The carbon dioxide they absorb is acidifying the seas. Coral reefs are bleached and dying. Air and water pollution are killing nine million people annually.”







As such “making peace with nature” must “be the top, top priority” of the 21st century, he warned, adding: “There is no vaccine for the planet.”

Welcoming the first commitments towards carbon neutrality from China, the European Union, Japan and South Korea, Guterres expressed hope that the movement would become global.

“Every country, city, financial institution and company should adopt plans for transitioning to net zero emissions by 2050,” he said.

Separately on Wednesday, the WMO said in a report that 2020 is on track to be one of the three warmest years ever recorded – and it could even top the record set in 2016.

The past six years, 2015 to 2020, are therefore set to make up all six of the hottest years since modern records began in 1850, the UN agency said.

“The average global temperature in 2020 is set to be about 1.2 [degrees Celsius] above the pre-industrial level,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.

“There is at least a one in five chance of it temporarily exceeding 1.5C by 2024.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/2/un-chief-denounces-suicidal-failure-to-tackle-climate-change
Climate change,‘Great distress’: Bangladesh bears brutal cost of climate crisis,"Experts say the effects of global warming are devastating Bangladesh and destroying the livelihoods of millions, particularly increased cyclones and flooding that brings saltwater further inland.

Bangladesh, a country of about 160 million, has historically contributed a fraction of the world’s emissions, and yet the low-lying delta nation is hard hit by climate change.

Year after year floods break through the mud embankments, washing away crops and village homes.

Abdus Samad’s home in Protab Nagar village in the southwestern Shyamnagar region was inundated after the village embankment was destroyed by incessant tidal surges. He has already lost his farming land to water.

Samad’s grandsons helped him bring more soil to rebuild the structure and make it liveable. But the family knows it may not last long.

“We are living in great distress,” Samad told the Associated Press news agency.

In 1973, 833,000 hectares (3,216 square miles) of land were affected by the encroaching seawater, accelerated by more frequent cyclones and higher tides that have contaminated water supplies.

That is bigger than the state of Delaware in the United States.

This grew to 1.02 million hectares (3,938 square miles) in 2000, and 1.056 million hectares (4,077 square miles) in 2009, according to Bangladesh’s Soil Resources Development Institute. Salinity in soil has increased by 26 percent over the past 35 years.

A decade-old deal for rich countries to give poor nations $100bn each year to switch to clean energy and adapt to climate change has yet to be fulfilled. Even the money that is being provided – about $80bn in 2019 – is spread too thin to make much of a difference on the ground.

With representatives from the world gathering for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland, from October 31, experts say countries such as Bangladesh will press for more financial support to cope with global warming.

“We don’t have ample financial and technical capacity. So, to address all the issues we need external international support. And according to UN, in fact, the developed countries, the industrialised countries, they are bound to help us under the UN convention,” said Fazle Rabbi Sadeque Ahmed from Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), a development organisation that works for sustainable poverty reduction in Bangladesh.

In Gabura, another village in the Bengal River delta, Nazma Khatun, 43, has been struggling to feed her two daughters.

Half of her meagre daily income – less than $3 from sewing and selling cloth – goes towards medicines for skin diseases that she says everyone in the coastal village of Gabura suffers from due to water and land contamination caused by rising sea levels.

Nazma said the land was once fertile and everyone grew vegetables in their back yard, relying on ponds, rivers and wells for drinking water.

She now blames saline water for all her suffering.

“My children can’t tolerate this water. They suffer from stomach problems, diarrhoea and dysentery. And they feel sick all the time,” she said.

Officials working in the region admit that paucity of funds was preventing the government from building new desalination plants that would convert salt water to freshwater.

At Bonbibi Tola village, women from the surrounding area gather daily outside a hand-pumped well to collect water for cooking and drinking. Each woman walks up to 4km (2.4 miles) daily.

But even this will not last for long since freshwater becomes scarce in the delta in the summer months when the flow from Himalayan rivers decreases.

“During flood, everywhere there is water, but no water for drinking,’ said Ahmed from Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF).

“How could we overcome (this), we know – if we could make their embankment shelter properly if we can make enough desalination plants,” he said.

Environmental campaigners say a sea change is needed in the international debate on climate aid to ensure a steady increase in funding to poor, vulnerable nations from a variety of public and private sources.

Despite seeing its gross domestic product (GDP) rise from $6.2bn in 1972 to $305 bn in 2019, Bangladesh cannot pay for the cost of global warming on its own.

There are only six countries in the world that are hit harder by climate change from 2000 to 2019, according to the 2021 Climate Change Performance Index by nonprofit organisation Germanwatch.

In those years, Bangladesh lost 0.41 percent of its GDP due to climate change, and a single cyclone in 2019 caused losses of $8.1bn.

Villagers, who have lost their land and homes to floodwater, say they are forced to collect small donations “even from the helpless and poor who work as daily labourers” and repair the embankments themselves to prevent saltwater intrusion.

“We are doing it so we can live,” said Mohammed Abu Bakkar Fakir, whose village shop has been swallowed by tidal surges.

Experts say summits like that in Glasgow will need to address the thorny issue of compensating countries for the destruction caused by global warming, something large polluters have long resisted.

The 2015 Paris accord already contains a provision for this. Article 8 states that parties to the pact “recognise the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, and the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of loss and damage”.

Rich countries such as the US are wary of such a move because it opens up the prospect of vast financial liabilities for their decades-long greenhouse gas emissions still lingering in the atmosphere.

But experts say addressing such issues in Glasgow will be critical.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/3/bangladesh-global-warming-climate-crisis-seawater-agriculture
Climate change,Climate change and the food security dimension,"The world’s most authoritative body on climate change science recently published a report emphasising that climate change is happening even faster, and with more damaging effects, than previously anticipated.

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report made clear that climate change willbe harmful for all of us – and not only for a few remote island states or polar bears – by affecting the world’s food supply.









Although the Panel has a deserved reputation for being a conservative and careful intergovernmental body, it declared its concern in this report using bold language. Even though the report repeated many of the findings of its Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007, some commentators nevertheless called its conclusions “alarmist”.

The report has sparked a discussion as to whether such alarming assessments are useful to spur people and governments to action.

Similarly, a new nine-part documentary series on American Showtime TV, “Years of Living Dangerously”, is attracting lots of attention – akin to the reaction to Al Gore’s 2006 movie “An Inconvenient Truth”, which introduced the general public to the threats associated with climate change.

Polarising or mobilising?

Social scientists continue to disagree about the effects of such alarming publications and films, and debate whether the message is polarising, rather than mobilising, the public.

Most people assume that the effects of climate change will never affect our daily lives. The famous picture of a polar bear precariously floating on a fragment of a melting iceberg, for instance, did little to convince people – especially in the developing world – that they should divert resources from economic growth, increased consumption and an improved standard of living.









But refusal to heed earlier warnings about climate change might be overcome by this most recent IPCC report, which reframed climate change as a food security issue. “Nobody on this planet is going to be untouched by the impacts of climate change,” said Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian scientist who serves as the distinguished chair of the IPCC.

For a long time, environmentalists exhorted the public to “think of your children and grandchildren”. No more. This report warned that negative impacts on declining crop yields due to climate change could become more likely in the 2030s, just around the corner.

Meanwhile, crop yields could decline by two percent per decade, at a time when demand is projected to increase by two percent each year.

Given the World Bank’s report predicting temperature increases offour degrees Celsiusby the end of the century, those gaps would widen dramatically. We should stop worrying about the world that our children and grandchildren will inherit, but think of how to protect ourselves!

‘Global implications’

Food security is an immediate concern for every human being, and ensuring it calls for fundamental changes in our daily habits. Individual and common action will be required to achieve a viable global agricultural policy and trade in a warming world.

In March, Oxfam, a global non-governmental organisation, published its own report called: “Hot and Hungry: How to stop climate change derailing the fight against hunger.” In a press conference, Oxfam’s head of policy for food and climate changesaid: “This is no longer a picture about poor farmers in some regions being hit by climate change. This is a picture about global agriculture being hit – US, Russia and Australia – with global implications for food prices.”

The negative impact of climate change on food production is no surprise. Farmers and herders are the best observers of how changing climate, drought, flooding and other extreme weather events affect their harvesting of crops or animals. As early as 2008, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)emphasisedthat: “Climate change will affect all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation and food system stability.”

While many countries are inadequately prepared for climate change’s effects on food supply, it is the world’s poorest and most food-insecure countries that will likely be most affected. Nevertheless, no country’s food system will be unaffected by worsening climate change.









Greater food insecurity could even posea security threat as competition intensifies for water and arable land. The IPCC Report warns about an “increase in risks of violent conflicts in the form of civil war and intergroup violence”. The decade-long armed conflict in Sudan, the ongoing civil war in Syria and unrest in Egypt are all example of how severe drought, internal migration and economic hardship can lead to devastating instability.

“Battles over water and food will erupt within the next five to 10 years as a result of climate change,” said World Bank PresidentJim Yong Kimof the IPCC report.

“The water issue is critically related to climate change. People say that carbon is the currency of climate change, water is the teeth. Fights over water and food are going to be the most significant direct impacts of climate change.”

Diplomats have been trying since the late 1990s to put in place legally binding agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But they have not been successful. Now, disappointed by diplomatic efforts, many have turned their eyes towards the world’s major energy companies, the biggest contributors to carbon dioxide emissions. This will be the key battleground if a coherent plan to fight climate change is to emerge.

Regressive politics

If climate change is reframed as primarily a food security issue, is it possible some climate sceptics will lose their influence, especially the members of the US congress who have taken them so seriously? The prospects are not encouraging. Just after the IPCC report was published, some US congressmen outrageously proposed a bill limiting the research activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to exclude climate change from its work and to focus only on forecasting severe weather events. These legislators don’t want to hear about climate change science.

We cannot have much hope, given the powerful fossil fuel lobbyists who so generously support climate deniers. Their political influence seems sufficient to block all reasonable efforts to move towards a post-carbon economy. Instead, the United States is ready to become the “Saudi America” of the 21st century by pioneering a new energy revolution based on fracking technologies and huge deposits of natural gas.

Can this regressive trend be stopped? Not a chance – unless a massive grassroots movement takes hold and changes the political climate in the United States and elsewhere, possibly by saying to the peoples and governments of the world: “Enough is enough!”

Climate change,Climate change threatens EU with mass deaths and huge costs: Report,"Europe urgently needs stronger measures to respond to climate change risks, a new report has warned.

The 32-paged assessment,publishedon Monday by the European Environment Agency (EEA), asserted that the bloc is not prepared to respond to the increasingly severe risks that climate change poses. The policy adviser’s first-ever report on the threats faced by the world’s fastest-warming continent warns of “catastrophic” consequences.

“Hundreds of thousands of people would die from heat waves, and economic losses from coastal floods alone could exceed 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) per year,” the report read.

Urgent policies targeting healthcare systems, farming and critical infrastructure are needed, it continued, noting that extreme heat and drought events, once rare, are becoming more common.

“If decisive action is not taken now, most climate risks identified [in the report] could reach critical or catastrophic levels by the end of this century,” the analysis said, urging the EU to integrate climate risk into budgets and policies across sectors.

Those risks likelywill not diminisheven if the world meets the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of keeping average temperatures no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the researchers, who analysed five sectors ranging from business to health, noted.

An EU monitor recently noted that the world hadcrossedthe 1.5C warming threshold last year, as 2023broke records. However, the target has not been permanently breached because it depends on measurements taken over decades.

Climate-related hazards on food production are especially set to hit southern Europe hard, the report said, noting that less than 2 percent of EU farming subsidies are spent on helping farmers manage risks.

The report also recommended that the EU set requirements to protect outdoor workers in agriculture, construction and other industries from extreme heat or floods.

New “Eurocodes” for building infrastructure are also needed, because of mounting risks to critical infrastructure, such as floods damaging roads or extreme heat warping train tracks.

The report also called for the EU to design funding instruments to help countries prepare their healthcare systems to cope with climate change, which hits vulnerable and elderly people particularly hard.

Climate-related events accounted for 85,000 to 145,000 human fatalities across Europe over the past 40 years, according to the EEA. Extreme heatwaves in 2022 caused more than 60,000 deaths on the continent, researchers found separately.

Europe has faced a wave of severe climate events in recent years. In 2021, unprecedentedfloodsswept across Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, leading to costs of 44 billion euros ($48bn).

The same year, Italy saw more than 150,000 acres (60,700 hectares) of forest burned in severe wildfires, the largest number in at least a decade. In 2023, flash floods in Slovenia caused damage estimated at more than 10 percent of the country’s GDP.

Combined, economic losses from weather and climate-related extremes in EU countries exceeded 650 billion euros ($711bn) from 1980 to 2022.

Climate change,Climate change is harming the health of Australians,"During the paralysing heatwave of January 2014, Ambulance Victoria, the pre-hospital emergency care provider for Melbourne and rural Victoria state, could barely keep up with demand. Emergency dispatches in the region were up 25 percent above average, as heat-related disease in the metro area spiked five times above normal levels.

After temperatures finally dropped, following the hottest four-day span in Victoria’s history, the state government estimated an additional 167 deaths as a result of the heatwave. It would be reasonable to assume these were conservative figures.

















Welcome to a warmerAustralia.

Over the past half-century, average temperatures across the continent have steadily increased, bringing more frequent heat waves that are longer and hotter than any in recorded history. Such prolonged heat waves are causing heightened rates of dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke, and worsening existing health conditions like heart disease, and potentially even acute kidney injury. Tragically, children and the elderly are most vulnerable. While human health is the hardest hit byclimate change, its impacts are far-reaching, with small and large businesses alike under threat.

In the short term, dirty air makes it harder for a child's lungs to develop, and can contribute to stroke and heart attack later in life.

The effects of climate change aren’t unique to Australia, but it does present a unique set of challenges there. Indeed, no country is immune, with climate change threatening to overwhelm the basic health and government services we depend on. TheUKgovernment’s 2017 nationalClimate Change Risk Assessmentidentified a number of “high-risk” priorities, including the infrastructure damage and health impacts expected from flooding and coastal erosion; and again, the effect of rising temperatures on the public’s health.

In response to this, many world leaders, have finally woken up to these threats. The Paris Agreement ushered in a new era of international climate cooperation, and even as theUnited States, the world’s largest historical emitter, pulled out of the deal, other economic powerhouses have reaffirmed their commitments to accelerate climate change mitigation. Last year, the UK government pledged to phase out coal-fired power by 2025 and are on track to deliver on this.

Australia, unfortunately, has been slow to act on the reduction of climate warming pollutants and on better preparing the health community to deal with its impacts. Instead, the federal government has worked to strengthen its ties and investments in the coal industry, leaving the health and medical community scrambling to catch up to their international counterparts in addressing climate change and health.

However, a few days ago marked a turning point. Australia has taken an enormous step forward, as a coalition of the country’s leading health experts and organisations joined federal parliamentarians in launching a newFramework for a National Strategy on Climate, Health and Well-beingfor the country.

The Framework provides a roadmap to help policymakers and health authorities address and prepare for the real and present dangers that climate change poses to public health.

It cannot come soon enough.

Across the world, the burning of fossil fuels is harming our health. In the short term, dirty air makes it harder for a child’s lungs to develop, and can contribute to stroke and heart attack later in life. Through climate change, the most vulnerable and least prepared in society are most at risk.

Recognising the knowledge gap is one thing, but now the government must follow through and turn these strategic plans into tangible actions. If policymakers heed the advice and tap into the extensive expertise of the health community, Australians will be better prepared, and safer, when the next bushfire threatens a country town or the next heat wave hits.

Climate change,Over 100 million people in Africa threatened by climate change,"A new report by the United Nations has warned that more than 100 million “extremely poor” people across Africa are threatened by accelerating climate change that could also melt away the continent’s few glaciers within two decades.

The report released on Tuesday by the World Meteorological Organization presented a grim reminder that Africa’s 1.3 billion people remain “extremely vulnerable” as the continent warms more and at a faster rate than the global average – when the continent’s 54 countries are responsible for less than 4 percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

“By 2030, it is estimated that up to 118 million extremely poor people will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat in Africa, if adequate response measures are not put in place,” said Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko, commissioner for rural economy and agriculture at the African Union Commission.

The extremely poor were defined by the WMO as those who live on less than $1.90 per day.

“In sub-Saharan Africa, climate change could further lower gross domestic product by up to 3 percent by 2050,” Sacko said.

“Not only are physical conditions getting worse, but also the number of people being affected is increasing,” she said in the report’s foreword.

WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said that last year temperatures continued to rise across Africa, “accelerating sea-level rise” as well as extreme weather events like floods, landslides and droughts – all indicators of climate change.

Last year, Africa’s land mass and waters warmed more rapidly than the world average, the report said.

The 30-year warming trend from 1991-2020 was above that of the 1961-1990 period in all of Africa’s regions.

The rate of sea-level rise along the tropical coasts and the South Atlantic, as well as along the Indian Ocean, was higher than the world average.

The report also highlighted the shrinking glaciers of Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya and the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda as symbols of the rapid and widespread changes to come.

“Their current retreat rates are higher than the global average. If this continues, it will lead to total deglaciation by the 2040s,” it warned.

“Mount Kenya is expected to be deglaciated a decade sooner, which will make it one of the first entire mountain ranges to lose glaciers due to human-induced climate change.”

Though too small to serve as significant water reserves, Africa’s glaciers have high tourism and scientific value.

On Tuesday, African countriesalso demandeda new system to track funding from wealthy nations that are failing to meet a $100bn annual target to help the developing world tackle climate change.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/19/climate-change-threatens-more-than-100-million-in-africa-un
Climate change,Where will the climate refugees go?,"New York, US –No one can be sure just how many people will be displaced by climate change by the middle of this century. In fact, the estimates vary widely, with some putting the number at25 millionand others suggesting it could hit theone billion mark.

What is clear, however, is that cementing a number is not the only hurdle facing those attempting to decipher the practical ramifications of climate change. Terms such as “climate refugee” and “environmental refugee” are still not classified as legal categorisations. And it’s difficult to determine whether a person isfleeing their home because of an environmental disaster, lack of work, or the established, long-term impacts of climate issues like drought or rising sea levels.









However, one factor is increasingly clear: This amorphous, global population of refugees does not have any international legal protection or agency upholding their basic human rights and helping to keep them safe.

READ MORE: Long Road to Paris

“Yes, there is a protection gap involving climate change refugees, but we don’t call them climate refugees for the reason that they are not covered by the 1951 [Refugee] Convention,” said Marine Franck, a climate change officer at the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR.That treaty extends only to people who have a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a social group or political opinion, and are unable, or unwilling to seek protection from their home countries.

This means that the estimated200,000 Bangladeshiswho become homeless each year due to river erosion cannot easily appeal for resettlement in another country. It also means that the residents of the small islands of Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu, where one in 10 has migrated within the past decade, can’t be classified as refugees, even though those who remain are“trapped” in worsening environmental conditions.

Displaced every second

The latest figures from theInternal Displacement Monitoring Centre 2015 reportshow that more than 19 million people from 100 countries were forced to flee their homes in 2014 because of natural disasters. Within that, national responses to disasters have been fragmented and systems that pre-empt consequences of environmental phenomena, less than adequate.

“One part of the issue is how to prevent people from being displaced and that is very important … one person is displaced every second by a natural disaster. The numbers are huge,” Franck said.

In the lead-up to theUnited Nations climate change conferencein Paris, which concluded on December 12, climate change and human mobility activists, experts and academics worked to ensure that the connection between these issues is addressed appropriately. However, the two-week meeting largely centred on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the eventual agreements governments reached focused on the reduction in global temperatures by 2100.

“We feel there is a need to recognise climate change and its impact on human mobility,” said Alice Thomas, the climate displacement programme manager at the Washington, DC-based advocacy group Refugees International. “Our approach has been this needs to be supported through adaptation, which means that countries need to be prepared for this.”

Theconsensusamong scientific organisations, including those represented on theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(ICC), is that the impact of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions visible today is unprecedented. Oceans have warmed and risen, massive glaciers and ice sheets have diminished and extreme events, like drought and tropical cyclones, some scientists say, have become more intense or more frequent in certain regions.

Sea level could creepto anywhere between about one metre, or three feet, up to three metres, or nearly 10 feet, by the year 2100, depending on CO2 concentrations in the air and the rate of melting that occurs in the Polar regions, among other factors.

This means that the melting of ice sheets in West Antarctica and Greenland could lead to a potentially two-metre – six-foot – sea level rise in major cities such as New York. Increases in temperature could make places like Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Qatar uninhabitable by 2071. And the list goes on.

These anticipated environmental changes will have enormous effects on many populations, especially those in coastal and low-lying areas like Vietnam, the Netherlands and certain parts of the US. Already, people are now twice as likely to be displaced than they were in the 1970s, according to Justin Ginnetti, the head of data and analysis at the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.This is due to the combined effect of rapid population growth, urbanisation and exposure to natural disasters.

“The reason is pretty simple. There are more people on the planet today living in hazard prone areas, vulnerable to natural hazards than there were in the 1970s,” Ginnetti said in a phone interview. “There is a lot that is unknown but we do need to take action now and the best action we can take is to make sure that our thinking and planning is adaptive.”

However climate refugees were not central to the talks this time around in Paris. The Paris COP21 conclusion agreement reportedly received a mixed welcome from participants and observers alike. The document does not mention “refugees” or other terms like “migration” and “mobility”. It does, however, call for a task force to “develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimise and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change”.

This recommendationdid touch upon previous calls by various organisations, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), for theestablishment of a climate change displacement coordination facility solely devoted to climate-induced displacement.

RELATED – Extreme weather: Coincidence or climate change?

The details have yet to be formally ironed out,but the facility– not designed as an actual physical centre to house the displaced– could help arrange emergency relief and provide relocation support. It could also assess the risk of internal and cross-border environmental displacement and provide technical assistance to national governments.

However, it is not clear how the facility will be funded, who will govern it, or how it will be affiliated with the UN system.

The Nasen Initiative

The Nansen Initiative, a three-year-old state-led, consultative process aimed at building a consensus on a protection agenda for displaced people impacted by environmental disasters or climate change, supported the inclusion of human mobility challenges in the Paris agreement. It has not taken a formal stance on the climate displacement facility.

Headquartered in Geneva, The Nansen Initiative is among the champions of a multipronged way to approaching human mobility and climate change. More than 100 nations approved anon-legally binding agendathis October at a Nansen global consultation that prioritises protecting cross-border displaced persons and linking different national policies. This could extend to helping new arrivals stay in a country that admitted them, if they are unable to return to their homes because of prolonged environmental issues.

One important finding from the coalition’s series of consultations in places as far apart as the Pacific Islands and the Greater Horn of Africa is the impact climate change is already having on people’s ability to withstand disaster, said Atle Solberg, the head of the Nansen Initiative Secretariat.

“There is much more states can do to prevent displacement, compared to a conflict situation, when it comes to natural hazards and disasters,” Solberg explained.

He emphasised the role development initiatives can play in the case of earthquakes, using the 2010 examples of Haiti and Chile. The Chile earthquake was an 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale while the Haiti earthquake was a 7.0. But the Haiti earthquake killed more than 230,000 people, while 525 died in the Chilean disaster.

“It’s an issue of preparedness and the level of development related to urban planning and evacuation centres,” Solberg said.

Beyond words

Political concern surrounding displaced people and climate change has been present, bubbling under the surface for more than a decade. In the early and mid-2000s, Anwarul Chowdhury, the former UN High Commissioner for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, advocated for an expansion of the international legal definition of a refugee to include those forced out of their homes because of climate change. But Chowdhury, who also served as Bangladesh’s ambassador to the UN, was met with a tepid response from other diplomats.

But it seems that support for this has now materialised beyond academic circles to some degree, particularly since the Nansen Initiative was founded, according to Refugees International’s Alice Thomas.

Experts are moving beyond the singular approach of expanding the Refugee Convention to include those impacted by climate change or environmental disasters, suggesting that to address such a large issue, states must focus on more than just terminology.

READ MORE: Has the climate change deal really averted catastrophe?

“No one – scholars or anyone – thinks changing the convention is the way to do it, so if the convention is not the correct place to address the issue, what does the phrase really mean?” said Alex Randall, the head of the UK Climate Change and Migration Coalition. “Some people think it could take decades to negotiate this further and there is also an emerging consensus that it could be addressed using a whole new international agreement.”

Ultimately, there are many options floating around, and it is “unclear which is going to be the ticket”, Randall explained.

As of now, people who intend to declare themselves a refugee because of an environmental disaster or climate change have no opportunity for recourse, said Michael Gerrard, an environmental law professor at Columbia University in New York. A New Zealand court recently shot down the case of a Kiribati man who fought to become recognised as a climate change refugee. He was deported back to hishome country.

Gerrard first stumbled across the question of legal rights for climate refugees in 2005, when the Marshall Islands’ UN ambassador approached him seeking legal guidance. The Marshall Islands, Palau and Kiribati all have a special arrangement with the US that allows citizens to migrate freely.

However, there is generally a lack of national policies to prevent displacement, according to Franck, of UNHCR. She stressed the importance of including citizens in this process, as displaced people in the Philippines were not consulted on their relocation following the typhoon a few years ago.

Identifying people affected by climate change can be difficult, warn experts like Franck. One season of severe drought can knock out someone’s crops, but farmers and scientists alike are unlikely to immediately attribute the resulting food shortage to extreme weather caused by climate change. For example, multiple studies linkedAustralia’s record-setting heat wavein 2013, stretching into 2014, to climate change. But typically, connecting climate change to extreme weather is not easy, given thecomplexity of the events.

“Even when you ask people from Pacific Nations why they moved they will give you similar answers about livelihood and work and being able to get a visa for some countries and not others,” said Randall. “It is difficult if we cannot isolate this group, how do we create a legal framework for them?”

UNHCR’s communication officer Andreas Needham said he has observed this during his work, with some Somalis arriving in Kenyan refugee camps following periods of drought citing livelihood as their prime reason for migrating.

As such, ambiguities remain and a devastating drought or a massive tropical cyclone might not push a person into the unofficial category of an environmental or climate refugee.

However, there is still a strong likelihood that extreme events like these may become even more intense and more frequent. These erratic weather patterns and warming temperatures could essentially make areas of the world uninhabitable, possibly displacing millions, and may make hopes many have of establishing a home, a virtual impossibility.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/12/22/where-will-the-climate-refugees-go
Climate change,"Ahead of US election, Europe eyes an ally in climate change fight","For countries hoping to avoid the worst of climate change, next month’s United States presidential election will be pivotal in determining the course of global climate action, experts say.

A win for the Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, would inject new life into global cooperation in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to past climate negotiators.









A second term for President Donald Trump, on the other hand, could prove more disruptive than his first by emboldening climate-sceptic countries.

“The US needs to get back in the game,” said Kelley Kizzier, a former European Union climate negotiator who now works at the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, almost 200 countries pledged to work towards limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That goal has since slipped further away, as climate-warming emissions continued to increase.









Trump rejected the agreement altogether and the US is set to exit it on November 4 – the day after Americans go to the polls.

A Biden win, experts say, could help put those efforts back on track.

Biden wants to spend $2 trillion over a four-year term towards reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 in the US, currently the number two emitter of greenhouse gases. Committing further to slashing emissions this decade could nudge China and other high-polluting countries to follow suit.

“If the United States, China and the European Union move in that direction, then I believe we can take the rest of the world along with us,” Frans Timmermans, the EU’s top climate official, said during a Reuters news agency event last week.

Countries have been asked to update their Paris pledges this year. So far only 14 have done so, including Norway, Chile and the tiny Marshall Islands. The 27-country EU plans to upgrade its pledge in December.

China, the world’s largest emitter, says it will become carbon neutral by 2060, but has not yet revised its climate plan for the next decade.

United Nations scientists said in a major report last November that without steep emissions cuts by 2030, the world will be unable to prevent catastrophic climate change.







Biden, who would take office in January if he wins the November 3 election, has pledged to immediately rejoin the Paris Treaty. That would oblige Washington to make a fresh emissions-cutting pledge well ahead of the next UN climate summit in November 2021.

“Biden will have to move forward in the early days of the administration,” said John Podesta, a counsellor on climate and energy to former US President Barack Obama who is now an informal adviser to Biden.

“Other countries will begin to judge the administration’s level of ambition based on that,” Podesta told Reuters.

While many US states, cities and businesses are already cutting emissions, the country is still falling short on the Obama-era pledge to cut emissions by 26-28 percent by 2025, against 2005 levels.

Trump, who has rejected mainstream science on climate change, has unravelled Obama-era regulations, seeking to free the energy and auto industries from the costs of regulations meant to protect health and the environment.

China’s surprise pledge last month to aim for carbon neutrality by 2060 could curb global warming by 0.2-0.3 Celsius this century, researchers say.

But that “needs to just be the starting bid”, said Thom Woodroofe, a former diplomat in UN climate talks, now a senior adviser at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

A “united approach” from the EU and the US could push Beijing to go further, particularly on near-term emissions cuts, he said.

Podesta suggested that the EU and the US imposing carbon taxes on imports could work towards that end. Brussels will propose a policy next year to impose such costs and Biden has pledged to introduce one.

Maintaining pressure on China will be especially important as Beijing decides on funding for coal plants under its next five-year economic plan.

“The discussions with China are not over,” said Laurence Tubiana, a former French diplomat instrumental in brokering the Paris accord, who now heads the non-profit European Climate Foundation.

But restoring diplomacy on climate could face obstacles, not least because of the frictions between the US and China under Trump on other issues.

This week, Beijing published a stinging document on the US environmental record, calling Washington a “consensus-breaker” and a “troublemaker” and saying the Trump administration’s measures had undermined global climate cooperation.

Global climate negotiations have floundered in recent years. Most countries at last year’s UN summit in Madrid snubbed calls for bolder emissions-cutting pledges.

“Nobody did, except Europe,” said Nils Torvalds, a Finnish lawmaker who was part of the European Parliament’s delegation at the event.

The summit coincided with the EU striking a deal to slash emissions to net zero by 2050. Meanwhile, the UN event failed to reach agreement on rules for international carbon trading.

A second term of Trump will be exponentially worse for climate than the first.

byBas Eickhout, Dutch member of European Parliament

“We were unable to get as many decisions as we would have liked, because we were alone,” Torvalds said.

A Trump win could slow this further, some experts worry. Dutch lawmaker Bas Eickhout, who led the European Parliament’s delegation to Madrid, said it could embolden Russia, Brazil or other countries to disrupt climate collaboration.

“Trump’s unpredictability has become a bit more predictable,” Eickhout told Reuters. So “countries who didn’t like climate anyhow might seize the opportunity to put more brakes on the process of Paris.

Climate change,Is Israel’s Gaza bombing also a war on the climate?,"Many of the world’s leaders are gathered in Dubai for COP28, the annual United Nations summit on climate change. Some 2,400km (1,500 miles) to the West, meanwhile, Israel’s war on Gaza is raging.

Sixty days into the war, Israel’s bombs have killed about 16,000 people, including more than 6,600 children. But increasingly, experts are also worried about its effect on the environment and on Gaza’s ability to combat climate change.









From polluted water supplies to toxic smoke-filled air from burning buildings and bodies, every aspect of life in Gaza is now filled with some form of pollution.

“On the ground, this war has destroyed every aspect of Gaza’s environment,” Nada Majdalani, the Ramallah-based Palestine director for EcoPeace Middle East, told Al Jazeera.

Here’s a look at how the unstoppable bombardment of the enclave could further affect climate change in a region that has already seentemperatures increase, with projections of a 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) rise by the end of the century.

Gaza has been under an Israeli siege for 16 years, with Israeli authorities holding the switch to — among other things — dependable access to fuel and power in the enclave.

As a result, the people of Gaza turned significantly to solar energy to power their homes.

“Gazans have been climate adaptive, and some 60 percent of their energy would come from solar power,” Majdalani said.

But Israeli bombing has damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings, many of which were roofed with solar panels.

“Destroying the solar panels is not only targeting the wellbeing of people, it’s diminishing the efforts of the Gazans in taking climate adaptation and measures to secure clean energy,” she said.

“These solar installations now lay in the rubble with the buildings destroyed, setting back Gaza’s climate change efforts.”

Amid the war, “getting figures and measurements of the extent of the damage” to Gaza’s environment is difficult, said Majdalani.

But some things are clear. Decaying bodies and contaminated water supplies are a “ticking time bomb” that will lead to the spread of diseases, she said.

“Right now this is the greatest concern, and everyone should be worried, including Israel. Having military might on the ground cannot protect them against the spread of cholera which is predicted.”

Impending rains are another concern. Majdalani’s team estimates 44 percent of gas, water and sanitation facilities have either been completely or partially damaged in Gaza since the war began. This includes water wells and wastewater treatment. Sewage water has already flooded Gaza streets, but if rain mixes with the filth, the risks of cholera and other gastrointestinal diseases increase further.

“The war damage to Gaza’s water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure makes flooding more likely with the winter rains,” Doug Weir, director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, an independent research body based in the United Kingdom, said.

Even before the current war,inadequate sanitation infrastructureand electricity shortages meant that untreated sewage water was dumped into the sea and wasresponsiblefor more than one-quarter of illnesses. It was the primary cause of child morbidity in the Gaza Strip.

According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, the total shutdown of wastewater treatment plants in October, after Israel imposed a complete blockade on any fuel entering the strip, led to the release of more than 130,000 cubic metres of untreated sewage into the Mediterranean Sea daily, posing a grave environmental hazard.

With the destruction amid the current war, huge volumes of debris and waste are blocking sewers, warned Weir. This, he said, “will allow more standing water, with associated risks to human health from transmissible diseases from wastewater mixing with rainwater.”

This war, like others before it, requires vast quantities of fossil fuel, leading to excessive carbon emissions and pollutants in the environment.

Earlier reportssuggest 25,000 tonnes of munitions were dropped on Gaza in the first few weeks of the war. The carbon emissions from this would equate with the annual energy use of approximately 2,300 homes, or the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from approximately 4,600 passenger vehicles.

The world’s military forces also use fossil fuels to operate aircraft, tanks and weapons, accounting for approximately 5.5 percent of global emissions. The figure could be higher as defence forces are not bound to report their carbon emissions as it may undermine national security.

“Methodologies to count emissions from conflicts are in their infancy,” Weir told Al Jazeera.

But things are slowly changing.

Last week, the UN Environment Programme’s flagship Emissions Gap report, which is released before each COP meeting, made mention of conflict and military emissions for the first time, calling for more research into the topic.

Groups like Human Rights Watch have also accused Israel of usingwhite phosphorous munitions in Gaza, which added further to the pollution in the atmosphere, said Majdalani. “As Gaza enters the rainy season, we expect the rain to fall as acid rain, contaminated with white phosphorus.”

People who use plastic sheets to collect rainwater to drink directly, amid a shortage of drinking water, could be particularly at risk, she said.

In the first weeks of the war, the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA reported Israel dropped42 bombs every houron Gaza.

In addition to the emissions from weapons, their manufacture also contributes to pollution, Weir explained. “Far more emissions come from them during production, for example in creating the metal for their casings.”

Reports from Ukraine suggested the fighting there released some 100 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere in the first seven months of the war.

So what about Gaza?

“We anticipate that the bulk of the emissions in this war will be from military fuel use – Israeli jet fuel and diesel, from urban and landscape fires caused either by the destruction of buildings or targeted attacks, and from the carbon costs of reconstructing Gaza.”

Other risks include fires, pulverised building materials that can include harmful substances like asbestos, and pollutants released from facilities containing hazardous materials.

Even rebuilding war-torn areas that have turned to rubble causes significant emissions. “Producing concrete and cement to rebuild generates a large quantity of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the climate crisis,” said Weir.

Lennard de Klerk, from the Initiative in GHG Accounting of War, did a rough calculation on how much GHG emission would result from rebuilding just residential and non-residential buildings that were destroyed or damaged after the first six weeks of the war.

He told Al Jazeera, “5.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions would be released to produce construction materials and the emissions of the construction activities itself”.

That is already a fifth of the projected emissions for the reconstruction of Ukraine from its war, which has been going on for 21 months as opposed to two months in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/is-israels-war-on-gaza-also-hurting-the-climate
Climate change,Iran’s failure to tackle climate change – a question of priority,"It’s like being stuck between a rock and a hard place.

The status of Iran’s response to climate change depends on the one hand on a conservative government that prioritises its economy over the environment, and on the other an international community that treats the country like a pariah with crippling sanctions imposed for its nuclear programme by the United States.

With an entourage of world leaders descending upon Glasgow, Scotland, for the crucial UN climate talks COP26, the Iranian foreign ministry announced President Ebrahim Raisi would not be attending the conference, with the interests of the country instead represented by a group of climate experts.

While the Iranian government officially recognises climate change as an existential threat, fighting it does not seem to be high up on its to-do list.

Speaking volumes is the fact that the head of Iran’s Environmental Protection Organization (IEPO) was one of the last officials to be appointed by the president.

The world’s sixth-highest greenhouse gas emitter, Iran faces many environmental challenges.

Ali Mirchi, assistant professor of water resources engineering at Oklahoma State University, told Al Jazeera that “due to its location and chronic mismanagement issues, Iran must prepare to disproportionately shoulder the adverse effects of climate change on water resources, environmental systems, food security, and rural livelihood, among other things, compared to many other regions of the world.”

Despite these realities, analysts have said the Iranian government will refrain from taking any significant climate action unless the sanctions that have devastated the country’s economy are fully removed.







Iran’s mitigation efforts have been rated “critically insufficient” by the Climate Action Tracker, indicating total non-compliance with the Paris Agreement, an internationally binding treaty aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels, a goal that COP26 also strives to keep within reach.

With more than 90 percent of its energy mix comprised of fossil fuels, Iran’s transition to clean energy is crucial for reducing the amount of emissions released in the atmosphere.

If the planet heats up any higher than 1.5C, the damage to the environment will becatastrophic and irreversible, a fact confirmed in the chilling report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in August.

To show they are taking the IPCC’s warning seriously, and in preparation for COP26, all developed countries submitted ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are plans containing targets on how much a nation commits to reducing its emissions by a certain date, usually around 2030, to make a net-zero 2050 scenario feasible.

For nations classified as developing by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) though, providing NDCs is more difficult given the extra cost that mitigation would bring to their economies.

On top of that, such countries, including Iran, have said the wealthy industrialised nations should help finance their energy transition since they are responsible for about 80 percent of the world’s emissions.

The last time Iran made any mitigation pledges was back in 2015 as part of its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), “but the targets are vague and are subject to international support, including financial support and clean technology transfer,” Manal Shehabi, senior research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and director at SHEER Research & Advisory, told Al Jazeera.

INDCs are voluntary targets and are usually converted to NDCs when the issuing country formally joins the Paris Agreement, a task that Iran has yet to complete. Iran is among a few countries left to have signed but not ratified the Paris accord, meaning it is under no legal obligation to commit to global mitigation demands.

According to its INDCs, Iran plans to cut emissions by 12 percent by 2030 compared with the so-called “Business As Usual” model, a baseline the IPCC defines as the point at which countries would operate if emission cuts were no longer necessary.

Eight percent of Iran’s cuts, however, are conditional upon the termination of US sanctions and the availability of international resources.

Any binding climate pledges right now would result in extra spending and “the government is reluctant to sign international agreements that would mean costs for it,” said Kaveh Madani, research professor at the City College of New York and former deputy head of Iran’s environment department.

Iran is working on a highly sensitive deal with world powers over its nuclear programme, which could lead to the easing of sanctions on its economy if reached. In exchange, Tehran is expected to provide assurances that its nuclear capabilities will be used for energy purposes and not for developing weapons.

Nuclear energy has been identified as an important player in the global transition to clean energy by the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2050 net-zero plan.

Ultimately “every country in the world that chooses to use nuclear energy safely and peacefully and that works together with the international community should have access to this fabulous technology”, Sama Bilbao y Leon, director general of the World Nuclear Association, told Al Jazeera.

Several of Iran’s high greenhouse gas emitting neighbours have recently made significant strides in their efforts to tackle climate change.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey are emerging as dark horses at COP26 by submitting net-zero plans to show, at least on paper, they are willing to reduce their energy reliance on fossil fuels. Iran, however, has remained nonchalant despite global pressure to transition to a greener economy.

Tehran’s messaging on climate action has stayed the same throughout. At COP23 in 2017 in Bonn, Germany, the country said it would ratify the Paris Agreement only in the contingency of the full implementation of its nuclear deal with world powers and financial support.

Even if Iran decides to implement the 12 percent emission cuts pledged, the cost of it would be too much to bear at about $70bn.

The country is expected to run a $10.2bn budget deficit this fiscal year, according to the Majlis Research Center, the research arm of the Iranian parliament.

Meanwhile, American sanctions have also prevented Iran from accessing the funds allocated to it by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), an organisation responsible for helping countries with their environmental problems.

“You cannot expect a country that has dire socioeconomic and political issues to focus on climate change,” Madani said.

For the Iranian government, the threat of climate change is not one it can deal with at this point under so much economic pressure.

“Even if they (Iran’s leaders) consider it important, they don’t have the will and bandwidth to address it. Eventually, it is the rich [nations] that need to help pay if they want the world to exist,” said Madani.

Climate change,Climate change displacement: ‘One of the defining challenges’,"Climate-induced catastrophes have devastating global effects, from intense heatwaves to heavy rainfall.

In 2023, record-breakingheatwaveshit much of continental Europe and resulted in wildfires and flash floods that took lives.

In China, typhoons have forced school closures and evacuations. Meanwhile, in South Asia, rising temperatures andlonger monsoon seasonsare increasing cases of mosquito-borne dengue fever.

Last week, the United Nations published a newreporton climate change and found that countries agreeing to fight global warming by signing the Paris accord had only made limited progress.

The2015 Paris Agreementis a legally binding treaty to limit the global temperature increase this century to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. Experts have warned past that level, the problems arising from widespread flooding, droughts and heatwaves could become unmanageable.

As weather patterns continue to become more volatile, the prospect of climate-induced migration is increasingly becoming a core issue.

According to the UN, extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall and droughts, have alreadycaused“an average of more than 20 million people to leave their homes and move to other areas in their countries each year”.

Here’s everything you need to know about climate-induced migration:



Climate-induced migration is a movement pattern caused by the effects of climate-related disasters, including droughts leading to a food and farming crisis.

Ezekiel Simperingham, global lead on migration and displacement for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), told Al Jazeera: “Climate-related migration and displacement is becoming one of the defining challenges that we are seeing as a humanitarian network. We’re not just seeing it in one region … we’re seeing it across different regions. We’re seeing it manifest in very different ways.”

According toClimate Refugees,an organisation documenting the growing threat of climate displacement, climate change can exist as a “threat multiplier”.

“Exacerbating existing risks and creating new ones like food and water insecurity and competition over resources, which contributes to conflict and compound displacement,” it said.

For those who fled conflict and seek refuge in a new country, climate change will direly affect an already displaced population.

Eujin Byun, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told Al Jazeera western and central Africa, which suffer from frequent flooding, are also dealing with continuing conflict.

“So its not just one factor pushing this vulnerable displaced population, but it’s also that very complex dynamic that they have to keep moving around,” Byun said.

While many climate-displaced peoples are also fleeing conflict, climate organisations are wary of referring to them as climate refugees and find the phrase limiting.

In international refugee law, the term “climate refugee” does not exist, and that type of migration does not qualify for protection under the1951 Refugee Convention.

Under the UN convention, a refugee is defined as a person who “owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of [their] nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to … return to it”.

Byun explained that referring to a person as a climate refugee limits the complex situation because the term would mean that a person fled strictly because of a climate event and not from other issues affecting the country.

“I think part of the reason why people are grappling with the terminology, and I think part of the reason why we try and have a more expansive approach is because we’re also seeing that people are moving in very different ways because of climate change,” Simperingham added.

Sanjula Weerasinghe, coordinator of migration and displacement at the IFRC, also told Al Jazeera that only some people are moving in the same way that refugees do, and more often than not they’re making decisions based on various factors.

“Some of it will be related to climate, but some of it may be related to the governance around where they live. Some of it relates to their livelihoods, which may be impacted by climate, but preexisting conditions and how they were able to or unable to earn an income,” Weerasinghe said.

“To just highlight the climate as the key reason why is not entirely accurate.”

According to theMigration Data Portal,in 2022 about 8.7 million people in “88 countries and territories were living in internal displacement as a result of disasters”.

The top five countries with the highest levels of internally displaced people (IDPs) were Pakistan, the Philippines, China, India and Nigeria because of weather-related issues such as floods and storms.

Byun said there are two displaced populations: those internally displaced and those who left for neighbouring countries.

“They [people affected by climate change] don’t really want to cross the Mediterranean because they still have their farm to keep, they still have property back in their country,” she said.

So narratives of a “flood of refugees” coming to the Global North are not the reality and are not helpful in understanding climate migration, Simperingham added.







As climate-induced migration becomes one of the defining humanitarian struggles worldwide, the UN hassaidthe world must invest in preparedness to “prevent further climate-caused displacement”.

The UN has also created aRefugee Environmental Protection Fundto invest in reforestation and clean cooking programmes in climate-vulnerable areas.

Simperingham explained one of the opportunities related to climate migration is that efforts can start before people have moved to address their humanitarian needs.

“What I mean is better understanding the communities, the parts of the world that are at the highest risks of the impact of climate, especially where they are intersecting with other risks and vulnerabilities”, he said.

But, some argue there needs to be more discussion on solutions from the global community.

“What can be done to stop that same situation happening again? What are the options for people to move within their country and sustain their resilience and wellbeing? So that’s an area – and that’s an agenda that needs a lot of attention,” Weerasinghe said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/15/explainer-climate-changes-effects-on-global-migration
Climate change,"To stop climate change, we need to open borders","Europe is facing its biggest refugee crisis since World War II. What is new this time around is that many of the displaced are being driven from their homes by the destructive effects of climate change. And this is just the beginning.

As sea levels rise, swallowing island nations and swamping large parts ofBangladesh, and as droughtstriggerfood shortages across much of the global South, the refugee crisis will only worsen. And we can expect that Europe’s right-wing parties will respond by doubling down on their already-potent anti-immigrant rhetoric with a push to seal off the borders.









Pundits on the left denounce this as a craven, mean-spirited stance towards those who are suffering the most from our collective climate crisis. And they’re right: opening the borders to climate refugees is a matter of basic justice. We need to devise policies to ensure that all have the right to access safe and habitable parts of the planet we share.

But there is something more to be said here. An open border policy may also be the key to stopping climate change itself.

Scientists tell us that on our present trajectorywe haveonly a 5 percent chanceof keeping global warming below the danger threshold of 2 degrees, as our addiction to endlessly expanding economic growth and consumption is swiftly wiping out the gains we’re making through technology and renewable energy. As a recent op-ed in the New York Times put it,“The climate crisis? It’s capitalism, stupid.”We need a new economic system – one that does not require this mad rush up an exponential curve – but our leaders are unwilling to take that step. There is a yawning gap between the threat posed by climate breakdown and how little we are doing to address it.

This is a puzzle. Why are we so willing to gamble thus with the fate of human civilization, with 95 percent certainty of catastrophe? Is it that we’re in denial? Are we just repressing a reality that’s too traumatic to confront? Yes, probably. But it’s also something much simpler: a geography problem.

The great irony of global warming is that its causes and consequences are inversely distributed. The rich nations of the global North are responsible for 70 percent of historical CO2 emissions, but they bear only about 18 percent of the total costs. It’s the South that takes the hit:according tothe Climate Vulnerability Monitor, the global South loses nearly $600bn each year due to drought, floods, landslides, storms and wildfires. As climate change worsens, their losses will reach a staggering $1 trillion per year by 2030.

And then there’s the human toll. Global warming claims some 400,000 lives each year worldwide – many due to extreme weather events but most due to climate change-induced hunger and disease (pdf). Only 2 percent of these deaths occur in the North. The South suffers the rest, and the vast majority of climate mortality occurs in the countries with the lowest carbon emissions in the world.

Yes, Britain has its floods, southern Europe its droughts, and the United States its hurricanes. But as devastating as these are for ordinary people’s lives, those governments have so far absorbed the costs and kept chugging along with the status quo – more growth, more consumption, more emissions,more capitalism. They are not acting on climate change because they have no real reason to care. The consequences of their industrial over-consumption are harming lands far beyond their borders.

It’s a textbook case of moral hazard: they are willing to take the risk because someone else bears the cost. Of course, eventually, this will change. They will get serious when their coastal cities flood and their food imports dry up – but by then it will be too late.

The solution is simple, at least conceptually: open the borders. By tearing down the walls that separate the causes and consequences of climate change we can force a more honest reckoning with reality. Once the victims of climate change have the right to seek refuge in Europe and North America, it will obliterate the moral hazard of global warming. As rich nations finally start to feel the heat, so to speak, you can bet they’ll act fast, doing everything in their power to ensure that people’s home regions remain livable. Even if it means pushing for a new, more ecological, economic model.

This might seem unrealistic at a time of rising anti-immigrant sentiment. But either we do it now, finding orderly ways to integrate climate refugees and allowing ourselves to be spurred to action by the suffering we’re forced to confront, or down the road, we’re going to face a refugee crisis more severe, violent and destabilising than anything we can imagine. We have a choice.

Climate change,US wildfires: How climate change is spurring deadly blazes,"San Francisco, United States –As deadly wildfires continue to burn in the US, from the Pacific Northwest down to the California-Mexico border, LeRoy Westerling has a sombre projection for beleaguered residents and exhausted firefighters: “It’s going to get worse.”

Westerling, a climatologist at University of California Merced (UC Merced) who has spent more than two decades studying wildfires and the weather that drives them, said a lot of vegetation has yet to burn – and dead trees and brush provide fuel to the fires.









Climate change has made the current blazes more severe than in previous years, he said.

“The west is an arid region, and with climate change, a dry region is getting drier,” Westerling told Al Jazeera.

The deadly wildfires on the US West Coast have forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. In California alone, nearly 15,000 firefighters were working on Friday to contain more than two dozen major wildfires across the state.







Experts such as Westerling point to a combination of factors linked to climate change they say are spurring the blazes across the region and making it more difficult for emergency crews as they battle the flames.

The western US has seen less rain and snowfall in recent years, which means forests dry out quicker when the summer heat comes, Westerling explained, and that means the fire season is longer “because [the forest] dries out earlier”.

Years of drought from 2011 to 2019 also worsened the situation.

Westerling said the current fires are plume-driven, which means the flames are shooting up into the sky and may generate their own thunder. “That’s why we see big cloud formations over these fires. They’re creating [their] own weather system that enhances the spread of the fire.”

Allen Schauffler, lead anchor at Central Oregon Daily News who has covered wildfires in the area since 1987, said he has noticed fires worsen over the past decades.

“It just seems that fire seasons can start earlier, last longer and burn hotter than when I started. Also, more people have built more homes in the boondocks [isolated areas] and so there’s the potential for more property damage and more loss of life,” Schauffler told Al Jazeera.

He said this year’s fires in Oregon come after a period of drought and a string of high-desert lightning storms.

About 500,000 Oregon residents have been evacuated from their homes – more than 10 percent of the state’s 4.2 million people, the AP news agency reported on Friday, citing the Oregon Office of Emergency Management.

It's not just sheds and homes and gas stations going up in flames. It's lives and towns and human connections and memories and culture.

byAllen Schauffler, lead anchor at Central Oregon Daily News

Schauffler said resources have been stretched thin as the state tries to cope with mass displacement and firefighters battle the blazes.

“It’s not just sheds and homes and gas stations going up in flames. It’s lives and towns and human connections and memories and culture,” he said.

CJ Martinez, a resident of Talent, Oregon, a small town in the south of the state near the border with California, said his apartment and truck were destroyed in the wildfires.

Martinez, who was caring for an elderly parent in California when the fire engulfed his home, said he was shocked to hear the news. “I had to tell my manager [and my] colleagues in real-time that I had just lost everything,” he told Al Jazeera.

“I just blurted out, ‘I just heard from my landlord that my truck burned and my apartment, there’s nothing left. I guess that means I’ve lost everything.’ I was numb.”

While the impact of the fires has already been devastating for so many people, Westerling said the burning season is just getting started – and strong winds that typically begin in late autumn are expected to make the situation even more difficult to control.

He pointed to 2017 fires in Santa Rosa, in California’s Sonoma County, which forced more than 200,000 residents from their homes and burned 149 square kilometres (57.5 square miles) of land, and the deadly 2018 fires in northern California’s Butte County as examples of how wind – and a lack of rain – can worsen things.

“We need rain or snow to end fire season,” said Westerling.

Some US politicians, such as California Republicans Devin Nunes and Tom McClintock, have baulked at the suggestion that climate change is making the wildfires worse. But the state’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom recently rejected that discourse.

“I quite literally have no patience for climate change deniers,” Newsom said during a news conference in the fire zone on September 8. “It’s completely inconsistent, that point of view, with the reality on the ground, the facts as we are experiencing.”

For his part, Westerling said a warming planet creates the dry conditions that propel the fires – and paints a bleak picture for the future. “The fire problem is not going away.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/11/us-wildfires-how-climate-change-is-spurring-deadly-blazes
Climate change,"Iraq dust storm sends more than 1,000 to hospital","More than 1,000 Iraqis were rushed to hospital with respiratory ailments on Thursday because of a  sandstorm, the seventh to hit the country in the past month.

Residents of six of Iraq’s 18 provinces, including Baghdad and the vast western region of Anbar, awoke again to a thick cloud of dust blanketing the sky.

Authorities in Anbar and Kirkuk provinces, north of the capital, urged people to stay indoors, the official INA news agency reported.

Hospitals in Anbar province received more than 700 patients with breathing difficulties, said Anas Qais, a health official.

The central province of Salaheddin reported more than 300 cases, while the central province of Diwaniya and the province of Najaf, south of Baghdad, each recorded about 100 cases, the news agency added.

Iraq is particularly vulnerable to climate change, having already witnessed record low rainfall and high temperatures in the past few years. Experts say these factorsthreaten to bring social and economic disasterto the war-scarred country.

In November, the World Bank warned Iraq could suffer a 20-percent drop in water resources by 2050 because of climate change.

In early April, a government official warned Iraq could face“272 days of dust” a year in coming decades.

The environment ministry said the weather phenomenon could be addressed by “increasing vegetation cover and creating forests that act as windbreaks”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/5/iraq-sandstorm-sends-more-than-1000-to-hospital
Climate change,Is climate change to blame for the California wildfires?,"The “Pyrocene” is upon us. At least, that is the theory which was first introduced by fire historian Stephen Pyne in a 2015 essay.

United States Forest Service ecologist Gavin Jones described the Pyrocene in a 2023 interview with The Explorers Journal as the current era in which humans experience greater fire activity than before. The key driver – human activity.

Thewildfirescurrently ripping through suburbs of Los Angeles in California and beyond have claimed at least 11 lives so far as well as more than 30,000 acres of land and more than 10,000 buildings. They are the most destructive wildfires in the history of the state.

As wildfires become more frequent each year around the world, concern from climate scientists that climate change is making them worse is mounting.

Intense and seemingly unstoppable wildfires in several Los Angeles neighbourhoods in California, US, which began on Tuesday, have killed at least 10 people and destroyed 10,000 houses and structures. About 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares) of land have been burned, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).

— Governor Newsom (@CAgovernor)January 8, 2025



California’s Governor Gavin Newsom said in a video he posted on X on Wednesday that there is no longer a fire “season” in California. “It’s year-round in the state of California.”

Pyne, an emeritus professor at Arizona State University’s School of Life Sciences, agrees. He told Al Jazeera that we now “have to live with a fire age, the fire-informed equivalent to an ice age”.

It is very likely, according to many experts.

The planet is warming to record-breaking levels, scientists warn. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) confirmed on Friday that 2024 was the first full year where global temperaturesexceeded pre-industrial levelsby 1.5 degrees Celsius.

C3S said the climate crisis is pushing the world to temperatures never before experienced by modern humans.

Climate change has contributed to an increase in the frequency, season length and burned area of wildfires, according to a report by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

As a result of all this, says Pyne, global warming is “adding energy to the system, magnifying the wet and dry spells, lengthening the fire season, ramping up all the [already powerful] elements that contribute to California’s firescape”.







The exact causes of the California fires, which began on Tuesday in the Palisades area of Los Angeles, are unknown and under investigation.

“But they are human,” Pyne says. “They might be directly related to people [malice, carelessness] or indirectly [say, through faulty power lines]. For the moment the origins are unclear.”

Experts say, however, that it is likely that a combination of environmental factors created the optimal conditions for the calendar-defiant fires tospread as rapidly as they have.

For one thing, southern California has not seen significant rainfall for months.

TheUS Drought Monitor’s latest mapshows that as of January 7, only 39.1 percent of California is completely drought-free. The rest of the state is described as “abnormally dry” and some areas are experiencing “moderate to exceptional” droughts.

At about this time last year – as of January 2, 2024 – 96.7 percent of California was classed as drought-free. Furthermore, only 3.4 percent of the state was abnormally dry and no parts were experiencing drought of any severity.

The extremely dry conditions cause the vegetation to become extremely parched and therefore highly flammable.

Besides this, Los Angeles has an abundance of other flammable materials in its infrastructure, such as low-hanging power cables and wooden telephone poles.

Hot Santa Ana winds have also gusted in from the interior of the region towards the coast and offshore, further dehydrating the vegetation, say experts. When vegetation is so dry and conditions are so flammable, any spark can start a fire, be it a burning cigarette butt, vehicle or power line.

Yes. The changing climate coupled with poor urban planning and management has exacerbated natural disasters globally, includingcyclones,hurricanesandfloods.

Scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) believe that if planet temperatures exceed the pre-industrial average by 2C, hurricane wind speeds could rise by 10 percent.

They also say that climate change might be slowing the pace – rather than the velocity – at which hurricanes move. This means that storms can dump more water on the places they pass through.

Warm oceans help cyclones intensify rapidly, Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune,told Al Jazeerain April 2023.

In October last year, the World Weather Attribution (WWA)saidthat climate change caused by fossil fuel use had increased seasonal rainfall across the Niger and Lake Chad basins by between 5 percent and 20 percent in 2024, causing more flooding.

Asian countries have also experiencedintense floodsin recent years. In April 2024, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) published a report that found Asia has been warming faster than the global average.

WMO chief Celeste Saulo said in a statement that “many countries in the region experienced their hottest year on record in 2023, along with a barrage of extreme conditions, from droughts and heatwaves to floods and storm”. She added that the “frequency and severity of such events” was exacerbated by climate change.







Wildfires are expected to worsen with time as a result of climate change and changing land use, according to a 2022 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and its partner, environmental communications centre, GRID-Arendal.

The report projected that extreme fires worldwide will increase by as much as 14 percent by 2030, 30 percent by the end of 2050 and 50 percent by the end of the century.

Furthermore, wildfires damage the environment in other ways, too. In terms of the California fires, “when (and if) winter rains finally arrive, they could lead to hillside erosion and debris flows”, Pyne said, suggesting that cleanup after the fire “will be messy, long and expensive”.

Conditions created by humans have also made it difficult to cope with the fallout of environmental disasters.

Pyne said “contemporary houses are filled with plastics, synthetics and electronics that can be toxic” when they go up in flames.

Wildfires burn away acres of land rapidly and can have different effects on wildlife inhabiting fire sites.

The effects depend on the type of wildlife and its habitat requirements, and the intensity and frequency of the wildfires, according to an article published by North Carolina (NC) State University.

Some species can quickly escape as a fire quickly engulfs acres of land. “Some animals, especially those that are immobile or too slow to escape, are more vulnerable to the smoke and heat of wildfires,” it explains.

It could. As wildfires change vegetation by thinning it, some wildlife can lose their habitat, and the resulting movement of wildlife can throw off the balance of a local ecosystem in a region.

Take snakes as an example. Some 33 snake species are endemic to California.

Michael Starkey, a conservation biologist whose work focuses on snake conservationtold Al Jazeerathat rising temperatures and dry conditions are making some regions uninhabitable for some snake species.

Starkey said that while some snakes can move away, other species could go extinct. This is a problem because snakes eat rodents which destroy crops for human consumption. This chain reaction can affect entire food systems.

California is also home to 700 vertebrate species, which simply put, are animals with backbones and skeletons. This makes the state the US’s most biodiverse, according to an article published by the US Department of Agriculture in March 2024.

Record-breaking wildfires engulfed California in 2020 and 2021, burning more than 4.2 million acres of land.

“Tragically, the bushfires killed or displaced almost 3 billion animals. It made me wonder what was happening to our wildlife,” the US Forest Service ecologist Jones was quoted as saying in the US Agriculture Department article.

Pacific Southwest Research Station Ecologist John Keane said that spotted owls are a particular species of concern, according to the article. “Wildfire disasters can destroy old-growth trees and dense forest patches upon which spotted owls depend for nesting, roosting, and foraging.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/11/is-climate-change-to-blame-for-the-california-wildfires
Climate change,Can planting trees really help fight climate change?,"Bill Gates is emphatic. “I don’t plant trees,” he declared recently, wading into a debate about whether mass tree planting is really much use in fighting climate change.

The billionaire philanthropist was being probed on how he offsets hiscarbon emissionsand insisted he avoids “some of the less proven approaches”.

The claim that planting enough trees could solve theclimate crisisis “complete nonsense”, he told a climate discussion organised by The New York Times last week.

“Are we the science people or are we the idiots?”

Gates’s polemical pronouncements made headlines and prompted criticism from backers ofreforestation(planting trees in damaged forests) and afforestation (planting in areas that were not recently forest).

“I have dedicated the last 16 years of my life to making forests part of the climate solution,” wrote Jad Daley, head of the American Forests NGO.

“This kind of commentary can really set us back,” he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Mass tree planting schemes have been gaining ground for years as a way to suck carbon from the atmosphere at scale.

Even notoriously climate change-scepticalUS Republicanshave introduced legislation to support planting a trillion trees worldwide.







But Gates is far from alone in doubting the benefits of such ambitious plans.

A group of scientists warned on Tuesday thatmass tree plantingrisks doing more harm than good, particularly in tropical regions.

That’s primarily because it can replace complex ecosystems with monoculture plantations.

“Society has reduced the value of these ecosystems to just one metric – carbon,” the scientists from universities in Britain and South Africa wrote.

Carbon capture is “a small component of the pivotal ecological functions that tropical forests and grassy ecosystems perform,” they said in an article in the Trends in Ecology and Evolution journal.

Jesus Aguirre Gutierrez, an author of the paper, pointed to examples in southern Mexico and Ghana, where once diverse forests “have now transformed into homogenous masses”.

This makes them “highly vulnerable to diseases and negatively impacts local biodiversity,” the senior researcher at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute told AFP news agency.

Major tree planting commitments often involve agroforestry or plantations, where the trees will eventually be felled, releasing carbon.

And they are dominated by five tree species chosen largely for their timber and pulp value, or growth speed.

Among them is teak, which can overtake native species, “posing additional risks to native vegetation and the ecosystem”, said Aguirre Gutierrez, who is also a Natural Environment Research Council fellow.

Other critiques include the lack of space globally for the many proposed mass planting projects and the risk of competition between smallholder agriculture and planting.

Misclassification of grassland and wetland as suitable for forest and planting poorly adapted or cared-for seedlings have also been problems highlighted by scientists.

So does planting trees really have no value? Not so fast, says Daley, whose American Forests organisation says it has planted 65 million trees.

It’s Gates’s premise that is wrong, Daley said. “Literally no one is saying … that forests alone can save our environment,” he told AFP.

He argues that critics ignore carefully calibrated projects involving native species in areas that need reforestation and focus instead on a few poorly conceived schemes.







“This broad brush critique has ignored the fact that much reforestation is driven by the loss of forests that won’t regenerate without help.”

“We are not just running around planting trees wherever we feel like it to capture carbon.”

There are efforts to bridge the gap between critics and proponents, including 10 “golden rules for restoring forests”, proposed by Britain’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Botanic Gardens Conservation International.

They advise avoiding grasslands orwetlands, prioritising natural regeneration, and selecting resilient and biodiverse trees.

But they start with a rule that perhaps everyone can agree upon:protect existing forestsfirst.

“It can take over 100 years for these forests to recover, so it is crucial that we protect what we already have before planting more.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/can-planting-trees-really-help-fight-climate-change
Climate change,African leaders seek global taxes for climate change at Nairobi summit,"African political and business leaders have adopted a declaration to address climate challenges in Africa on the final day of a major climate summit in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi

The adoption – announced on Wednesday by the summit’s convener, Kenyan President William Ruto – proposes new global taxes and reforms to international financial institutions to help fund climate change action in a declaration that will form the basis of their negotiating position at November’s COP28 summit.









The Nairobi Declaration capped the three-day Africa Climate Summit which was dominated by discussions of how to mobilise financing to adapt to increasingly extreme weather, conserve natural resources and develop renewable energy.

Ruto has been spearheading a new narrative, focusing on Africa’s switch to clean energy even as the continent reels from climate-related disasters.

“In Africa, we can be a green industrial hub that helps other regions achieve their net zero strategies by 2050,” he said at the summit. “Unlocking the renewable energy resources that we have in our continent is not only good for Africa, it is good for the rest of the world.”







Advocates have long called for rich carbon polluters to honour long-standing climate pledges for poorer and more vulnerable nations.

According to the United Nations, the continent contributes only about 2-3 percent of global emissions but suffers the most from the changing climate. Extreme weather events like drought – in the Horn of Africa – and flood – in parts of Central and West Africa – have become more frequent in recent years.

“Renewable energy could be the African miracle but we must make it happen. We must all work together for Africa to become a renewable energy superpower,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday at the summit.

He also urged leaders at the G20 – the 20 advanced economies meeting in Delhi, India this week – to commit to reaching net zero before 2040.

Ruto says Africa is well placed to take advantage of the need to move away from carbon-spewing fossil fuels, boasting a young population, vast renewable potential and natural resources.

This includes some 40 percent of global reserves of cobalt, manganese and platinum crucial for batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.

Efforts at the summit to up investment in renewables were given a boost as the Africa Development Bank (AfDB) announced $23bn in financing “for green growth, mitigation and adaptation efforts” to the Africa Climate Fund for the next 27 years. The UAE also pledged $4.5bn, while Germany committed $482.31m to help with the development of green energy infrastructure.

But there are daunting challenges for a continent where hundreds of millions lack access to electricity.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) says Africa hosts 60 percent of the world’s best solar resources, but only three percent of energy investments.

In a report published on Wednesday, the IEA and the AfDB urged donors and development finance institutions to scale up concessional funding to encourage private sector investment in Africa’s energy sector.

“Concessional capital of around $28bn per year is needed to mobilise $90bn of private sector investment by 2030 … a more than tenfold increase from today,” the report said.

Analysts and activists are split about the effectiveness of the summit and evidence of political willpower to follow through on recommendations.

“I think the political will is there, I think resource constraints are real,” Serah Mekka, Africa executive director at ONE Campaign, told Al Jazeera. “I think the impact of climate change is very real for Africa … so there is the urgency of the situation, I think where there is a will, there is a way.”

Kevin Juma, of The Nature Conservancy, called for immediate action.

“Even before today, there were announcements made on delivering climate finance to the Global South to a tune of $100bn per year – that was 14 years ago,” he told Al Jazeera on Wednesday. “So I think what needs to be done is to translating those commitments and announcements to tangible actions on the ground.”

Another environmental activist told summit participants on the event’s final day that carbon markets are “bogus solutions”.

“We reject forced solutions on our land,” said Priscilla Achakpa, founder of the Nigeria-based Women Environmental Programme. She urged the so-called “Global North” to “remove yourself from the perspective of the colonial past”.

Carbon markets, in which polluters effectively offset emissions by investing in tree planting or conservation initiatives, are cheaper to purchase in Africa than in many other parts of the world where schemes are more strictly regulated. African nations seek a better price to help achieve their own emission-reduction targets.

In Africa’s market, the continent earns less than $10 per tonne of carbon. Other regions can receive over $100 for the same amount. In carbon trading, one credit issued equals one tonne of carbon dioxide or another greenhouse gas equivalent removed from the atmosphere.

The voluntary carbon market, which remains dominant in Africa, has been plagued by integrity and transparency concerns. Environmental groups are concerned it is a free pass to keep polluting.

The summit is part of Africa’s preparation for the next United Nations climate change conference, which is scheduled to take place in Dubai in December. It has largely featured leaders in government, business and civil society, many of them veterans of other climate gatherings.

“Heading from event to event doesn’t leave us with a lot of constructive thinking time” to bridge the gaps that still divide communities on the best ways to reduce emissions,” said Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/6/african-leaders-seek-global-taxes-for-climate-change-at-nairobi-summit
Climate change,The shadow of climate change reaches the kitchen,"There are so many individual aspects of daily life in industrialised countries that are associated with the changing climate. We talk about energy efficiency with our automobiles, our air conditioners and other appliances, even the light bulbs over our kitchen tables.

But for the most part, the food served on the kitchen table has not yet joined the climate conversation, and it should. It is estimated that the food systems produce between a fifth and third of the greenhouse gases emitted by people on this planet.









This calculation includes every part of food production and distribution – including growing crops and raising livestock, manufacturing fertiliser and storing, transporting and refrigerating food. Agriculture accounts for around 80 per cent of these emissions, but the combined contribution of transport, refrigeration, consumer practices and waste management is growing as countries develop.

Climate-friendly food

While this news is not a complete surprise to most of us, we still do not shop for groceries according to emissions footprints. For example, if we want to reduce our greenhouse gas footprint, we should eat chicken instead of pork, and pork instead of beef.

While eating local foods has many advantages, in some circumstances we are better not to go local. For example, tomatoes grown in heated UK greenhouses result in six times greater greenhouse gases than those grown in the sun in Spain, even taking into account the emissions from transportation.

But will Londoners shop for meat and tomatoes according to greenhouse gases? It’s not included on the food label, so it’s not a decision point that’s readily available. Consumers would need to actively chase after this data, and the time to do this research is as much a luxury as the food choice available in northern supermarkets.

As you can see, the question of climate-friendly food is not the easiest one to tackle and one cannot blindly rely on market forces to carry the day. Making matters more difficult, the need to reduce the impact of food production on climate change is only one part of the crisis that we face. With the world population expected to rise by another one billion people in 15 years’ time, we need to produce more food with less emissions while adapting to changing climates.

The burden of this crisis does not fall, for the most part, in the kitchens of London. Rather, spin the globe to South Asia, with 300 million people currently undernourished, to Sub-Saharan Africa, with 234 million people in similar straits and to East and Southeast Asia, with 233 million people undernourished.

Under climate change, yields of maize, rice and wheat – the three largest sources of calories around the world – will decrease in many developing countries as temperatures rise and rainfall becomes more unpredictable.

Three-pronged crisis

By 2050, climate change could cause irrigated wheat yields in developing countries to fall by 13 per cent. Irrigated rice in these same countries could tumble by 15 per cent. In Africa, many farmers of maize, which is not that well suited to increased temperatures, could lose 10 to 20 per cent of their yields.

Many answers to this three-pronged crisis do not address all three; often times a past solution exacerbates another part of the problem. For example, synthetic fertiliser has been used with great success to increase crop yields. But fertiliser is also fingered as a key contributor to agriculture’s climate impacts.

Representatives of governments from all over the world are meeting at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change in Doha, Qatar. In years past, talks at this annual meeting have focused primarily on reducing emissions, an important problem that should have been tackled a decade ago. But the pace of climate change has far outstripped the pace of negotiations.

Delegates, while keeping a focus on reducing humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions, now desperately need to focus on adapting to the changing climate – how to grow more food is at the centre of this critical need. New methods and tools need to be implemented, technology to share innovations needs to be adopted and more research needs to accelerate the pace. Money must be spent to make this happen, to ensure our survival.

Most of all, political will must be found to confront the most important issue on our planet today. We can no longer afford to kick the can down the road.

Climate change,"Real solutions to climate change in Africa are about people, not profit","At this year’s African Union Summit held on 17-18 February in Addis Ababa, African leaders adopted theNairobi Declaration on Climate Change– a powerful show of unity in the face of a real threat to Africa.

Alternating droughts and floods have withered or flushed away crops and decimated livestock. Hunger is sweeping across the continent. In East Africa alone, Oxfam calculated last year that 13 million animals, worth $7.4bn, and hundreds of thousands of hectares of crops were lost, leaving millions of people without income or food. Our water engineers warned that one in five water boreholes they dig now in East Africa is dry or has water unfit for people to drink without treatment. Too often, they must drill deeper, more expensive, and harder-to-maintain boreholes only to find dry, depleted, or polluted reservoirs.









Faced with the threat of climate change, the unity of African countries is increasingly evident in negotiating forums, and deserves to be applauded: the initiative to create a yearly African Climate Week, along with the involvement of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) and the African Group of Negotiators for COP, all under the leadership of the Committee of Heads of States and Governments on Climate Change (CAHOSCC), and with the Nairobi Declaration as the cornerstone of the a common African position, will create a robust mechanism to champion the interests of Africans.

The Nairobi Declaration’s assessment aligns significantly with civil society’s viewpoint, especially regarding Africa’s minimal historical contribution to global warming compared to the substantial burden of consequences affecting lives, livelihoods and economies. It is positive to note that the Declaration acknowledges the key role of local communities in climate action. However, we must ensure that we give these communities the resources and protection needed to cope with the effects of climate change.

And this is exactly where the Nairobi Declaration falls short.

African countries committed to implementing policies, regulations and incentives aimed at attracting local, regional and global investment in “green growth”. The lack of clarity about what can be considered “green growth” opens the door to a myriad of solutions prioritising profit over people. For example, corporations can buy vast tracks of land to offset their carbon emissions abroad and continue pumping oil and gas  – a reality sadly widespread in Africa and elsewhere – to the detriment of smallholder farmers and their environment.

The call to rich countries to honour their commitment and scale up climate finance is an important ask, but it is necessary to look at the quality of the finance provided. While donors claim to have mobilised $83.3bn in 2020, Oxfam calculated that the real value of their spending was  – at most –  $24.5bn. The $83.3bn is an overestimate because it includes projects where the climate objective has been overstated or as loans cited at their face value. By providing loans rather than grants, these funds are even potentially harmful rather than helpful to local communities, as they add to the debt burdens of already heavily indebted countries.

Furthermore, the civil society organisations we work with often point to the lack of access and inclusion in existing climate finance mechanisms. In 2022, Oxfam found that only 0.8 percent of organisations that have direct access to international climate finance in the West Africa/Sahel region could be identified as “local”. There is still a lack of transparency in contributor reporting on how much climate finance reaches the local level and involves community participatory processes – this needs to change. It is necessary to create small grants that are both accessible and manageable for local populations.

The Nairobi Declaration does not comprehensively address the multifaceted challenges faced by women. This is troubling.  When food is scarce, women often eat least and last; and girls are the first to be pulled from school or married at a young age so there is one less mouth to feed. Many have to walk extra miles under the scorching sun, even carrying a child, to fill a jerry can of water, exposing themselves to safety issues. Resource stress exacerbates gender-based violence. Astudyon domestic violence in East Africa found that as the wealth status of women increases, the prevalence of domestic violence decreases, possibly due to fewer resource-related disputes.

The Declaration urges world leaders to establish a carbon tax on transport. But without adequate mitigation strategies, a global carbon tax could disproportionately impact the most vulnerable, further raising the costs of food, medicine and other essentials.

What we need are investments that will truly reach and help people adapt to climate change so they can produce food.IFADreports that in Africa, there are an estimated 33 million small-scale farms, producing around 70 percent of Africa’s food supply. Despite this, people in rural areas account for 90 percent of people living in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa according toFAO.

We also need investments in water and sanitation systems that will provide people with clean water and hygiene. In Southern Africa, only 61 percent of the population of SADC countries have access to drinking water, and only two out of five people have access to adequate sanitation. This is undoubtedly fuelling the recentspread of cholerain Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe where thousands of new cases and hundreds of deaths have been recorded since January.

Africa stands at a decisive crossroads. By resisting quick fixes and deadly traps offered by the market and by bringing the people at the centre of the climate action, our leaders have a great opportunity to make a decisive step towards the Agenda 2063 aspiration of a “prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development”. It is by championing equitable access to resources and opportunities that we will build a continent where every individual not only survives but thrives in harmony with the natural world.

Climate change,Climate change ‘sea snot’ killing Turkey’s Marmara Sea,"Balikesir, Turkey– Omur Karisik has fished in Turkey’s Sea of Marmara since he was 15 years old, just as his father did before him.

But the water has been taken over bya sticky web of “sea snot”caused by rising sea temperatures and ineffective waste management, and if something is not done soon he cannot see a way he can carry on.

The current flare-up, which began in December, is the inland sea’s largest recorded marine mucilage bloom and it is devastating the ecosystem, from the shores of Europe’s most populous city, Istanbul, to the Aegean, a popular spot with holiday-makers.

Environmental experts say the slimy substance is the result of an overproduction of phytoplankton, caused by climate change and the dumping of household and industrial waste.

Divers have observed mass fish deaths and say corals and sponges are fully coated in clumps of organic matter, often fatally, while ugly brown froth is being coughed up to the surface like phlegm from a diseased lung.

The phenomena is a stark warning to the world – a glimpse into an imminent future if humans continue to push the planet’s life support systems to the edge.

In the resort town of Erdek to the south, which sits on a peninsula that has seen some of the worst visible effects of the mucilage explosion, fishermen such as Karisik say their livelihoods have all but been stalled for the last six months.

The sludge collects in their nets making them so heavy they often break or get lost. The ones that do make it back are frequently empty as the strings are coated making them visible to the fish.

Karasik, 35, who has a family and a two-and-a-half-year-old child to support, said he is out at sea most days from 5pm to 5am, and yet he barely makes more money than it costs.

“We used to throw a few nets in twice a night and get three to five kilos of fish from each,” he said. “Now we throw 10 nets in again and again and get the same amount of fish in total.

“Over the last four days I have spent 1,000 lira ($115) on fuel and other expenses, but I perhaps made 1,200 or 1,500. If it carries on like this I will have to give up fishing.”

Over the weekend, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged to save the sea from the snot problem, blaming the outbreak on untreated water from cities, including opposition-run Istanbul.

Environment Minister Murat Kurum promised over the next three years pollution would be reduced, wastewater would be treated more effectively, and the area would be granted protected status.

However, according to those who live and work around the sea, the problem is not new and has been going largely unreported and untreated since 2007, although this is the worst it has been.

Mustafa Sari, dean of Bandırma Onyedi Eylül University’s marine faculty, said he warned more than a year ago an out-of-control mucilage explosion was imminent, but nothing was done.

The heavily industrialised sea has a special ecosystem because of being inland, yet untreated waste and agricultural runoff are poured straight in causing high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus.

Little effort has been made over the last few decades to reign in the creep of unsightly industrial facilities and concrete structures along the shores of a sea which is one of the smallest on Earth.

Sari said successive governments and municipalities have failed to prioritise the environment and instead continued to dump their waste into the sea.

“For 40 years, it’s been done wrong. There is not one specific cause of this but many problems. Everyone is to blame,” he said. “This is a last warning that we must do something about it.”

During a dive in Erdek Bay, Al Jazeera saw a seabed littered with rubbish ranging from vehicle tyres to scrap metal and even a toilet.

Everything, including scuttling crabs, was covered in thick, foamy saliva, and after only 40 minutes underwater even the hairs on the back of a hand were thick with mucilage build-up.

“The world does not take this problem seriously. This can happen everywhere – the same could happen in the English Channel,” said Sari. “We need politicians that really care about climate change.”

Some experts have warned of a possible risk down the line to human health, including diseases such as cholera – a disaster in a city like Istanbul with 16 million inhabitants.

When contacted about efforts to clean up the sea, Istanbul Municipality said it was “ready to coordinate with the central government and ministry”, but declined to comment further.

Mehmet Soyolcu, 43, the fourth generation of his family to fish the Marmara Sea, said the problem has been particularly bad for the last 10 years.

“We always knew this was happening here but the media didn’t care because it wasn’t on the surface. Now it can be seen in pictures people care.”

Soyolcu said it has become so hard to fish now that he no longer takes his boat out – nets that once took two hours to pull from the sea now take 10, and the expense of fuel and other running costs means it is not worth it.

“I have been doing this for a long time, but every day the costs are higher and there are less and less fish,” he said.

The loss of income for fishermen is compounded by an economic crisis in Turkey – one fishing net weight cost 15 Turkish lira ($1.70) last year, but now costs 22 lira ($2.50). A steady fall in the value of the currency means the price of even carrying out boat maintenance has tripled in the last year.

Karisik has raised his prices but it has not helped – he cannot always sell even his reduced catch because the sea snot has made people wary of Marmara’s fish.

A fish market close to Erdek’s seafront opened in January and had until recently seen huge success, despite the coronavirus pandemic. But since news of the mucilage problem spread, even its regular customers are staying away.

“Normally by this time [12pm], half our stock would be gone, but today we haven’t sold anything,” said Ozan, 23, who did not want to give his full name.

“A customer came in yesterday and said he was afraid of our fish. I said ‘don’t be scared, I eat this every day,’ but he wouldn’t take it.”

Ecologists have expressed fears that, with the sea already struggling to cope, plans to begin work on President Erdogan’s $15bn Istanbul canal mega-project and dig a nearly 17km (30 mile) channel between the Black and Marmara Seas should be stopped. The construction as well as the upset to currents could cause further strain to a sick ecosystem.







However, not everyone sees curtailing ecological damage as the main priority – some business owners believe the snot will soon calm down, but that media reporting of the invasion is causing people to be afraid to visit.

Recep Eren, 70, is a member of the Erdek municipality and runs a hotel among an olive grove where he produces organic soap for customers that he claims include Erdogan’s wife, Emine.

He said a preference for sensationalism was what was losing him business.

“All this area is fine,” he said, pointing to a stretch of clear sea in front of his hotel. “The area where the sea snot pictures were taken are places where everyone knows not to swim because that’s where the wastewater goes into the sea.

“If you show the worst everyone will think this area is bad, but there are places near here where you could think you are in the Maldives.”

As the tourism season ramps up, his 25-room hotel is normally at 30 percent capacity. At the moment it does not have a single booking.

“Even this time last year during COVID, I had more customers,” he said, urging people not to be scared of the water.

“I swim here each morning and there is nothing wrong with me.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/7/climate-change-sea-snot-killing-turkeys-marmara-sea
Climate change,Spanish politics undermining climate change fight,"Madrid, Spain –With higher-than-average increases in temperature, steadily advancing desertification and rising risks of drought and sea flooding, few would disagree thatSpainis on the front line of Europe’s battle against climate change.

But while government officials point to the ongoing COP25 conference as a sign of Spain’s firm engagement in the battle againstglobal warming, continuing political deadlock means the country’s long wait for a law to fight climate change on home turf continues.

In November, Spain held its fourth general election in four years, which was won by the Socialist Party. But the Socialists’ repeated failure to secure a parliamentary majority leaves Spain currently dependent on a caretaker government that cannot pass new laws.

This includes legislation on global warming drafted nearly a year ago, which Spain is said to need to ensure it reaches its 2030 targets on carbon emissions, and despite the Spanish parliament recognising – by an overwhelming 311 votes to 24 – that climate change “was a cross-party priority”.









“A climate change law doesn’t just raise public awareness, it also mainstreams the question across all government policy areas,” Maik Winges, a specialist on adaption to climate change with the environmental NGO Germanwatch, told Al Jazeera.

“That matters because you cannot adapt [to climate change] and leave something else out in the process.”

Germanwatch’s own analysis of Climate Change Performance [CCP] by country also suggests Spain’s need for urgent action. Spain is currently ranked 35th in the latest available 2019 CCP index from 2019, rated “low”, and 19 places below the average for the European Union.

How badly does Spain need a climate change law? Delia Gutierrez Rubio, spokeswoman for Spain’s state meteorological service, AEMET, says: “It is necessary for sure.”

Gutierrez Rubio told Al Jazeera it’s clear Spain is exceptionally vulnerable to climate change.

“Since the pre-industrial era, the world’s average increase in temperature has averaged 1.1 degrees Centigrade (about 1.98 degrees Fahrenheit) – but in Spain, it’s 1.6 degrees (2.88F).

“Our summers are an average of five weeks longer, the number of tropical nights [with temperatures above 20 degrees Celcius (68F)] is increasing, and since 50 years ago, Spain’s desert areas have increased by 10 percent. And they’re getting bigger.”

A Spanish government report recently predicted a possible rise of between 17 and 35 cm (6.7 – 13.7 inches) in sea level along Spain’s lengthy coastline as soon as 2028 – and it’s not just humans feeling the effects, as independent investigations on bird migration patterns suggest.

“Europe’s entire population of cranes, for example, used to spend the winter in Spain and in the north of Africa, but now they are staying in France or Germany,” points out Javier Cano, an ornithologist who works with the SEO-Birdlife NGO.

“Then African species like the trumpeter finch, the spotted vulture or the cream-coloured courser are starting to reproduce in Spain. Twenty or 30 years ago, that wouldn’t have happened.”

While government officials say there is EU praise for their proposed climate change law, NGOs and  specialist academics in Spain have concerns over what it can actually achieve.









“It doesn’t do enough in areas like agricultural transport, which has a particularly large carbon footprint in Spain,” Professor Alberto Mataran Ruiz, an environmental scientist at the University of Granada, told Al Jazeera.

“It gives a great deal of importance to photovoltaic solar energy, too, when building these kinds of solar panels can involve a great deal of CO2 production. And they don’t go into enough detail on the effects on territory their plans for wind energy could have.

“It’s like they have a plan, but they don’t have a road map.”

Javier Andaluz is the climate change spokesman atEcologistas en Accion (Ecologists in Action).

“Overall, the advances so far have been more symbolic than real,” he told Al Jazeera, saying the Socialists had an uneven track record on environmental action, which justified his reservations about the proposed law.

Requests made by Al Jazeera for an interview with officials from Spain’s Ministry for Ecological Transition were turned down due to a lack of availability. But popular pressure on the government to act shows no sign of disappearing.

A survey in the newspaper El Paíspublished on Sunday indicated that 90.5 percent of Spanish people believe “urgent” or “very urgent” measures were needed to act against climate change.

However – and even while COP25 continues for a second week in their capital – when it comes to legally binding action on home soil, the Spanish will have to wait.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/9/spanish-politics-undermining-climate-change-fight
Climate change,Sudan’s Nile fishermen worry as climate change means fewer fish,"Omdurman, Sudan– Al-Nimeiry Musa Mohammad has spent 25 years fishing on the Nile River and he has never been so worried about the future. Catches are dwindling and more fishermen are seeking other sources of income.

“I know many people who left the profession because of a lack of fish. Some of them travelled elsewhere to find work,” the 45-year-old said, standing by the banks of the Nile just north of a fish market in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join.

“Nowadays I catch around a quarter of what I used to catch. The last time I went out onto the river, I caught about 60kg [132lb] of fish, but sometimes it can be as low as 10kg [22lb],” Mohammad said at al-Mawrada, Omdurman’s biggest fish market.

The Nile’s fish stocks are plummeting, studies have shown, with rising temperatures fuelled by climate change, overfishing, and a lack of state regulation cited as factors by researchers.

While United Nations studies say Sudan’s fisheries make up relatively little of the East African nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) – a precise breakdown is unavailable – the industry provides jobs and is a key source of food and nutrition for a population of about 46 million.

Sudanese fishermen like Mohammad, as well as academics, fear that not only are fish numbers decreasing but some species are disappearing entirely from the Nile.

That is a worry as climate change and increasingly extreme weather threaten food security from farming and fishing worldwide.

Falling fish production in Sudan has been linked to the secession of South Sudan in 2011, after which Sudan lost access to many fishing locations and substantial inland water bodies.

But research by Khartoum University’s Institute of Environmental Studies in 2020 found that rising annual temperatures over the past 20 years have contributed to a decline in fish catches and the number of fish species observed in the Nile ecosystem.

While fish catches peaked at 87,000 tonnes in 2012, numbers dropped sharply between 2014 and 2020, never exceeding 42,000 tonnes each year, according to statistics compiled by Sudan’s Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries.

Elagba Haj Ali Mohamed, a professor at Khartoum University specialising in Nile fish, said the loss of key fish species and overall falling catches “indicate the effect of climate change”.

That presents a threat not only to food security in Sudan but also jobs and the national economy, she added, emphasising the vast productive potential of the Nile and its tributaries.

The food security threat is particularly worrying in a country already struggling with complex humanitarian crises linked to worsening droughts, rising food prices, renewed tribal conflicts and outbreaks of diseases such as dengue and malaria.

Sudan’s fishing industry relies mainly on traditional equipment, including spears, traps, cast nets and long-line hooks, with fishermen at work largely on the Nile, its tributaries, seasonal floodplains and a few man-made lakes.

Among the usual haul brought in near the al-Mawrada market are fish including Nile perch, tilapia and silver catfish.

At least 13,600 people in Sudan worked in inland fishing as of 2017, according to the latest available data by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), though this number does not include associated jobs from market sellers to boat builders.

Mohammad Gism al-Sayyed, a 64-year-old fisherman in Omdurman, said fish like the African carp and the Tark fish had vanished since he began working in the industry in the 1980s. Even “the size of the fish has also changed”, he added.

Higher water levels have also added to the difficulties fishermen have faced over the last three years, al-Sayyed said.

The flood-prone Blue Nile saw record water levels in 2020, several metres above average flood levels, which researchers attribute to heavy rainfall and rapid urban expansion around the river, which can create more runoff.

Several Sudanese fishermen also questioned what they said was a lack of government enforcement of laws to stop unauthorised fishing.

They highlighted breaches of fishing regulations they had observed, such as unlicensed individuals using thin nets that trap young fish before they can mature, hurting fish populations.

Mohammad Ibrahim, director of the Technical Office for Fisheries in Khartoum, said the government has plans to better protect the industry and tackle unauthorised fishing.

Those include efforts to make fishing more productive and sustainable, providing training and technical support and reviewing fishing laws, he said.

Essam Yassin Mohammed, director general of the research organisation WorldFish, said one of the main challenges facing African nations is that data on how mostly informal fishing contributes to the labour force and economy is lacking.

That can mean policymakers fail to adequately invest in improvements, he said.

“Preparing the management of fisheries for the effects of climate change will require significant investment and policy reforms, which cannot happen without a good understanding of the sector,” he said.

In addition to long-term temperature rises globally, marine heatwaves are estimated to have increased by more than 50 percent over the past 30 years, according to a 2019 article in the journal Nature.

Projections suggest that such warming events will occur more frequently, more intensely and for longer, the article said, posing a huge threat to biodiversity and ecosystems, with knock-on effects for fish catches.

In Sudan, many fishermen fear for their future.

“We used to catch a much larger amount … until our boats were almost sinking from the weight of the fish,” said Abbas Mohammad Idris, a 55-year-old fisherman in Omdurman who has worked on the Nile for 30 years.

Now, he said, such catches are history.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/4/4/sudans-nile-fishermen-worry-as-climate-change-means-fewer-fish
Climate change,‘No other option’: Climate change driving many to flee Guatemala,"Camotan, Guatemala– The rains in the village of Tizamarte in the eastern Guatemalan department ofChiquimulano longer arrive as they did in the past.

“Before it was beautiful, we used to have two harvests a year,” Transito Gutierrez told Al Jazeera.









“Now not one [crop] survives,” she said. “Now we cannot do anything. This drought does not end.”

Gutierrez’s hardship goes deeper than the lost crops, however. Last month, her 16-year-old son, Juan de Leon,died while in US custodyafter migrating to the US to find work and send money back home to his family.

“[Juan] told me that the coffee plants were dying. He said he was desperate,” Gutierrez told Al Jazeera earlier this month. “He said he could earn more there in theUnited Statesthan here. He could earn more than the $4 a day working in the field.”

While the cause of Juan’s death is still being investigated by US authorities, the reasons that pushed him to migrate in the first place are the same driving many families in this region to make the journey to the US: Years of drought due in part toclimate changeare driving more and more residents north to find work to support their families.

EasternGuatemalaand westernHondurasare part of a region known as the dry corridor. Over the last two years, farmers have seen near-complete losses during harvests as the effects of climate change take hold in the region, with 2018 being among the worst years in recent memory.

The Guatemalan government estimates that more than 200,000 families in 13 of the 22 departments were affected during the 2018 drought.

The situation was not much better in neighbouring Honduras. Officials estimate that nearly 170,000 people were affected in 2018.

In the Maya Ch’orti region of Chiquimula, rivers and water sources across the region are near-depleted or completely dried up. And temperatures, according to residents and the Guatemalan government’s National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology, have also risen significantly, adding to the strain on crops.

“The temperature has risen a lot,” said Gloria Amador, a 41-year-old nurse who has worked in the village of Tizamarte and the surrounding region for nine years.

“If it doesn’t rain then there is no work,” she told Al Jazeera. “There was no harvest of maize or beans this year. [The farmers] sowed seeds, but they lost everything.”

According to a 2018 report from the Guatemalan government’s National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology, this rise in temperature will continue due to climate change. They estimate that by 2050, the temperature is set to rise between 2.1 and 4.1 degrees Celsius.

These changes in temperature especially affect the country’s southern coast and dry corridor, including the village of Tizamarte, which is part of the municipality of Camotan, Chiquimula.

Central America is also one of the regions most affected by extreme weather phenomena linked to climate change. According to the 2019 Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch, Honduras andNicaraguaare among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in the last 20 years.

The drought has meant a near-constant crisis for farmers in this region.

It is estimated by local organisations that farmers lost between 80 and 90 percent of their primary staple crops, specifically maize, bananas, and beans, and economically viable crops such as coffee, during the 2018 drought. As a result, nearby towns that usually buy the crops are also affected.

“The harvests aren’t occurring due to the lack of the rain,” said Edgar Rivera, a 48-year-old maize vendor from Chiquimula.

“The farmers lost over 90 percent of their crops,” he told Al Jazeera. “As a result, the farmers were unable to recuperate the costs of production due to the intensity of the drought.”

Rivera has been importing maize and beans from other parts of the country and fromMexicoto sell in the market. But in turn, the costs for the products have also increased.

Other farmers, including Carlos Flores, are also heavily affected by the drought.

“It has been incredibly difficult due to the lack of water,” Flores told Al Jazeera as the 54-year-old farmer from the nearby town of San Juan Ermita sold green onions in the Jocotan market. “We are sowing less and when it does rain the harvests smaller.”

The drought has also disrupted traditional migratory routes that families have utilised to ease the pressures of poverty.

Historically, the residents of the region seasonally migrated to Honduras to work in the coffee harvest as a means of supporting their families. But the regional drought has affected the harvest so much that this migratory route has now all but ended.

“During the second cycle of maize, which is October and November, the people would go to harvest coffee or sugar cane,” said Jeremias Hernandez, an agronomist and member of the central coordination for the Ch’orti Maya organisation Nuevo Dia.

“Yet the problem is with the changes in the rains, the coffee production has fallen,” he explained. “As a result, plantation owners are either cutting back on the number of people they hire or lowering salaries.”

According to Hernandez, a small farmer could earn between 80 to 100 Guatemalan quetzal ($10-$14) a day harvesting coffee in 2015. But current rates are between 30 to 50Guatemalan quetzal($4-$7) as a result of the drought.

The near-constant drought directly affects the food security of families. As a result, the region has seen a drastic increase in cases of chronic malnutrition and disease, according to Amador and Hernandez.

“We have seen cases where families are only eating once a day, or in some extreme cases, every other day,” Hernandez told Al Jazeera.

Malnutrition remains a constant problem across Guatemala. The country has one of the highest malnutrition rates for children in the world, according to UNICEF.

The Guatemalan government launched a campaign to lower malnutrition, especially focusing on the Dry Corridor sector. But according to Vice President Jafeth Cabrera, the efforts were unable to achieve the goal of lowering malnutrition by 10 percent by 2019. Cabrera said that they would continue to work to reduce malnutrition.

As the droughts leave farmers without the means to provide for their families, many have sought opportunities in the US.

Amador estimates that in the last year and a half, at least 12 of the 110 families in Tizamarte have migrated to the US. This trend is common across the region.

“In our region, it was rare that people would migrate to the United States,” Toribio Aldana, a member and president of the local development committee from the village of Tesoro, told Al Jazeera.

“There were farms that would give work to the people, but today they do not provide work,” Aldana said. “As a result of this, there is no other option for the people other than to migrate. In the last two years, many have travelled for the United States.”

According to Hernandez, many young people took advantage of the larger migrant caravans that left the region beginning in October 2018 as a means to escape the effects of the drought.

Others including Juan de Leon Gutierrez travelled to the US border with smaller groups.

The first rains of 2019 arrived in early May, which normally signals the beginning of the planting season.

“Many are considering to plant right now, but there is a great financial risk,” Hernandez said. “They risk being further indebted if the drought does not end.”

The uncertainty of whether the rains will continue mean that many may consider migration out of necessity to provide for their families.

“The necessity to cover the basics, clothing, education, health, the indispensable, are the motivations for migration,” Hernandez said. “The drought is the final straw in the decision.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2019/5/13/no-other-option-climate-change-driving-many-to-flee-guatemala
Climate change,Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh’s ‘hot zone for climate threats’,"Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh –Climate experts in Bangladesh have expressed concern about massive refugee camps here – some of the largest in the world – being located in an extreme-weather hot zone.

Cox’s Bazar, a coastal region in southeastern Bangladesh, is prone to cyclones, wildfires, and landslides. Without prompt climate mitigation action and investment, Bangladesh’s coastal population and the estimated one million Rohingya refugees it accommodates are under severe threat, analysts say.

Although it narrowly escapedCyclone Mocha’s worst impacts, the area remains at great risk, scientists warn.

Saleemul Huq, a climate scientist and director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said landslides pose the biggest problem in the Rohingya camps. Predicting heavy rainfall patterns and cyclones is a challenging task, and this was evident during the recent encounter with Cyclone Mocha.

“While Bangladesh as a whole may be well-prepared, Cox’s Bazar remains a hot zone for climate threats,” Huq told Al Jazeera.

“The timing of cyclones is unpredictable as we saw with the recent threat towards Cox’s Bazar. Although the camps are aware of the problems, the lack of cyclone shelters poses a major issue. Unlike other coastal areas in Bangladesh, the camps lack proper shelters.”

If a cyclone were to directly hit Cox’s Bazar, the situation would be devastating, he said.

“Bangladesh has been making progress in addressing climate change, but we must acknowledge the lack of cyclone centres in the camps, putting Rohingyas in great danger.”

The climate scientist said action must be taken to ready the camps for the weather-related disasters to come.

“As the impacts of human-induced climate change become more and more apparent and visible and lead to significant losses and damages, it is necessary for all actors, including governments as well as others, to work together in a whole-of-society approach going forward,” Huq said.

Bangladesh is one of themost climate-vulnerable nationsin the world and tens of millions of people may be forced to flee the low-lying coastline as sea levels rise in the coming years.

In theaftermath of Cyclone Mocha, which hit neighbouring Myanmar’s western state of Rakhine the hardest, Cox’s Bazaar district was impacted with more than 450,000 people affected, including more than 21,000 Rohingya refugees.

Nur Ayesha, a 25-year-old Rohingya, shared her harrowing experience and the challenges her family faces after the storm.

“On the day of the cyclone, my children went to school while I stayed at home with my youngest daughter,” Nur Ayesha recalled.

“Suddenly, a tree fell inside the house on me while I was cutting fish to prepare our meal. It was fortunate the tree wasn’t too big, as both my daughter and I could have been killed. Trees fell from all sides of my house, leaving my house broken, and the solar panel was blown away. My husband is repairing the solar panel now.”

Nur Ayesha expressed disappointment at the lack of support received from aid organisations for the clean-up. “Nobody provided me with bamboo or any materials to fix my house. In the area where I used to do farming, I managed to gather some bamboo on my own. I want to strengthen my household, but it’s difficult to obtain the necessary materials.”

Laila Begum, a 50-year-old woman from the camps, pressed for better preparation from the fallout of extreme weather, describing her experience with Cyclone Mocha.

“The wind blew off the thatch, ruining our clothes and belongings inside. With no men in the household, only me and my daughters, we were terrified and drenched by the heavy rain. The downpour caused water to seep into the house. We need a stronger foundation to prevent such incidents in the future,” Begum told Al Jazeera.

The camps are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The materials used for constructing shelters are highly prone to fires, a reality that contributes to a pervasive sense of uncertainty and helplessness among the residents.

Mohammad Hasan, 60, a Rohingya refugee, expressed concern about the close proximity of homes in the camps and the risks from scorching temperatures.

“Each house is close to another and if a fire were to break out, we would have no choice but to burn in the flames,” he said.

Nur Islam, a 42-year-old refugee shopkeeper in the camps, rushed home as Cyclone Mocha’s winds picked up. “My nephew and I secured the thatch on our house and shop, anchoring the solar panels with ropes to protect them from the cyclone.

“The government and NGOs provided assistance to those with total losses, but families with less damage didn’t receive any help. I had some materials that I used to reinforce my house, but I need stronger materials.”







Sanjeev Kafley, from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), highlighted the profound climate threats faced by the Rohingya refugees, as well as their hosts along Bangladesh’s coast.

“It is essential to acknowledge that these challenges extend beyond the confines of the camps, affecting the broader local community. Cyclones do not discriminate; they impact both the camps and the host community,” said Kafley.

“This crisis remains unpredictable with an uncertain duration and an unknown future. The need for ongoing humanitarian assistance is undeniable, making it crucial for us to explore strategies to ensure our actions are both sustainable and climate conscious.”

Kafley linked the challenges of climate threats in the refugee camps with the state of despair among the Rohingya population.

“When you don’t have hope it is painful, we are all actually surviving with hope. These risk factors around climate change in the camps persist because of the absence of a durable solution. The hope isn’t there,” he said.

“We must examine how the global community perceives this agenda and join forces to support climate-friendly humanitarian actions in Cox’s Bazar.”

Climate change,How climate change destroys human rights,"In a 2012 interview, Oregon State University philosophy professor emerita Kathleen Dean Moore said, “Climate change is damaging food supplies, spreading disease and creating refugees, and it is poised to become the most massive human rights violation the world has ever seen.”Increasingly, the two issues – climate change and human rights – are being recognized as inextricably connected. Two major studies published this year reinforce that link, providing sobering evidence that a hotter, increasingly unstable climate is fueling more conflict and human rights violations, and that it is happening sooner rather than later.The firststudywas published in the journal Science by researchers at Princeton University and the University of California, Berkeley. Researchers found that a hotter, more unstable climate exacerbates three specific types of violence: personal violence (such as murder, rape and domestic violence), intergroup violence/political instability and institutional breakdowns (including the collapse of governing institutions and whole civilizations).Lead author Prof. Solomon Hsiang said the study includes “meta-analysis” of 60 previous studies from disciplines like history, economics, geography, criminology and political science. The research strongly indicates that tropical regions of the world, in particular, will be “very intensely hit”.If tropical populations remain on their current trajectories, Hsiang said certain types of intergroup violence could exceed a 50 percent amplification in association with climate change.Hsiang is cautious about drawing a direct link between climate change data and specific human rights abuses, but said, “There’s certainly the potential for situations where the climate leads to political changes that could adversely affect people’s rights,” adding, [climate change] destabilises and tests the amount of stress social institutions can endure.”“There is a lot of political rhetoric after disasters where people talk about becoming stronger as a community or economically because of it, but…there is very little evidence that is actually true,” Hsiang said. “Populations tend to be permanently worse off, families don’t necessarily become stronger because of these disasters, they end up struggling much more. Political organisations tend to do very badly.”In the face of greater violence, Hsiang said research continues to examine how certain social and political institutions may help mitigate some of the impacts that lead to more conflict. “What are the things that let societies weather [climate change] without exhibiting any type of conflict? That’s what we want to know so we can help create ‘pockets of calm’ in the future,” Hsiang said.Sooner than laterThe secondstudy, published in the journal Nature by the University of Hawaii’s (UH) Department of Geography, presents a concrete time frame when temperatures will reach unprecedented levels – so-called “climate departure”.The projected timing of climate departure refers to specific dates when given locations around the world continuously exceed historical temperature averages for the last 150 years. The study does not suggest the world will lose seasonality but, when averaged over a year’s time, temperatures will depart from recent historical norms.Co-author Ryan Longman said, “The coldest year in the future will be hotter than the hottest year in the past.” He added that the earliest impacts will occur in the tropics and have a ripple-effect to northern latitudes.Speaking from Honolulu, UH researcher and co-author Abby Frazier said climate change provokes three main reactions in plants and animals: migrating to more suitable environments, staying and adapting to the new climate or going extinct.“It’s very sobering,” Frazier said. “We see all of the evidence piling up and it’s really hard for people to accept that our future is heading toward these unprecedented climates. We’re trying our best to get the information out there in a concrete way that can connect people to this and is not abstract.”

“The coldest year in the future will be hotter than that hottest year in the past.”

– Ryan Longman

The UH study finds that on average, by 2047, under a “business-as-usual” scenario, the world will be experiencing a “radically different climate.” The study pays special attention to tropical regions. Frazier points out that while the largest absolute changes in climate do not occur in the tropics, because they are, by nature, climatically stable, it takes less change to exceed historic norms. As a result, the tropics are expected to experience climate departure first with Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, Mexico, India, Colombia and Iraq forecast to see climate departure as soon as 2020 and no later than 2036.“There’s no doubt that those early changes in the tropics will be felt at higher latitude even if the temperature is not getting hotter as fast,” Longman said.Frazier noted that climate change puts additional stresses on countries already facing extreme environmental degradation, burgeoning young populations and growing political instability. These countries have lower GDPs and less economic capacity to respond to climate change than those that have had the biggest role in producing carbon emissions.From toxic to ‘more toxic’Richard Pearshouse, a senior researcher with the health and human rights division of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Geneva, recently contributed to areportexamining environmental, health and safety conditions in and around the tanneries of Hazaribagh, on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Listed as one of thetop ten toxic threatson the planet in 2013, Hazaribagh epitomises how an environment degraded by extreme pollution and fed by climate refugees produces a human rights catastrophe.Pearshouse told Al Jazeera, “Climate change will affect many of the most vulnerable in society. It will affect the poor, it will affect religious or ethnic minorities, it will affect women and children. That should say a lot to a human rights organisation. It’s going to be the most marginalised who feel those impacts most acutely.”From health, housing and education to the right to life itself, Pearshouse sees climate change as having a massive impact on “a vast range of civil and political rights”.“If [climate change] is going to be about impacting on the most marginalised, then it’s going to be an issue of discrimination…and whether or not existing resilience or mitigation measures that are put in place by governments or international mechanisms truly reflect the reality of who’s suffering most on the ground.”Human rights groups like HRW, Amnesty International and others already work with environmental and climate groups but Pearshouse sees room for greater cooperation on a national and provincial level. “I think that as the human cost of climate change becomes increasingly evident, it’s untenable for human rights organisations not to be working on some of those issues,” he said.Bangladeshis a prime example of how climate change impacts impoverished fishing villages along the Bay of Bengal with more frequent, more powerful cyclones and flooding which drives villagers to migrate to places like Hazaribagh. There, out of desperation, the rural poor live in slums where the air, water and earth are so polluted by chemicals, tin roofing corrodes in months rather than years and severe health afflictions are the norm.“As someone who works on human rights and health, to me and my colleagues, that [climate change] overlap is very much apparent, particularly when you go someplace like Hazaribagh and see the amount of human suffering caused by extreme environmental degradation. To me that overlap is very, very obvious,” Pearshouse said.Whether it’s a government unwilling to enforce basic health and environmental protective safeguards in Bangladesh, state-sponsored repression of climate and environmental defenders in Russia, or military forces involved in illegal logging in Cambodia, Pearshouse said examples of clear links between the unofficial exercise of government power and environmental harm are found around the world.Facing a human rights ‘meltdown’Far from the toxic tanneries of Bangladesh, indigenous peoples across Russia’s far north face new and increasing threats to their basic human rights as resource extraction, development, industrial pollution and climate change converge at the top of the world.Rodion Sulyandziga represents the interests ofRAIPON(Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North) with the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation among Arctic states and indigenous communities.Speaking from Moscow, Sulyandziga described how the loss of sea ice, decline in snow levels and permafrost and general warming all impact the most basic human rights of the 41 indigenous groups in Siberia and the Russian far north and Far East: the right to live.Increasingly unpredictable weather and unreliable sea ice directly impacts animal migration, which affects subsistence hunting for traditional food sources like reindeer and sea mammals. Warmer temperatures, Sulyandziga said, also hasten the introduction of plant and animal diseases as southern species of fish and birds move north.In addition to a warming Arctic, Russia’s indigenous peoples also face the rush to exploit vast energy and mineral resources. Oil, gas, coal, nickel, iron ore, platinum and other minerals draw multi-national corporations to Russia’s most remote regions where highly restricted access makes monitoring health and safety practices, damage and pollution mitigation and other conditions difficult or impossible.RAIPON has worked with Greenpeace and smaller environmental organisations to protect the environment critical to the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, Sulyandziga said.Last year RAIPON was subject to a temporary closure when the Russian Ministry of Justice forced it to cease activities during a five-month investigation of what it alleged were “illegal activities” and defenders called a registration technicality. This kind of extra scrutiny of NGOs makes protecting indigenous and environmental interests even more difficult.Sulyandziga added, “Russia now approved the Arctic strategy meaning they declare the Arctic is a main resource [of] economic development for the whole country. That means potential conflicts will grow among stakeholders, including indigenous people.”He also spoke of the threat to basic human rights for indigenous groups stemming from illegal timber harvesting, the destruction of arboreal forests and its role in massive wildfires and last year’s devastating floods in the Russian Far East. His own people, the Udege (which means “forest people”) live in the affected area near the Amur River north of Vladivostok.The biggest human rights violation everBack at the University of Hawaii, lead author of the aboveclimate departure study,Dr. Camilo Mora, assistant professor in the UH geography department, sees climate change as a problem of fairness. “While developed countries are benefitting from [carbon] emissions, developing countries are the ones that are going to pay the most consequences from this,” Mora told Al Jazeera.“The science is as solid as it can be. Now it’s for us to start acting and I think that’s where we’re struggling to convince people of how real this thing is. We have seven billion people we need to convey this message to.”Mora said climate change is, and will continue to be, interconnected to the most basic of human rights: the right to have a home, food and water. “I don’t think there is a disconnection [to human rights], in fact, things are more connected than people tend to assume.”Greenpeace International’s executive director, Dr. Kumi Naidoo, argues the same point. Naidoo recently said, “The struggle to avert catastrophic climate change and the struggles for human rights, poverty and gender equity are and should be seen as two sides of the same coin.”

Climate change,"In Fiji, villages need to move due to climate change","Vunidogoloa, Fiji–Just a few metres from the shoreline, a slab of concrete indicates where Sailosi Ramatu’s home once stood.

The headman of Vunidogoloa village was born here in 1960 on a river estuary in Natewa Bay, on Fiji’s second-largest island, Vanua Levu.









Today, all that remains of his childhood home is the concrete bathroom foundation and three wooden stumps sticking out of the dark, muddy sand. The beach is just a few metres wide, precariously situated between a grassy elevation leading to the main part of the old village and the bay.

“This river was not as wide as this before. It was just there,” said Ramatu, gesturing into the distance.

“When I was eight, I used to cross this river. Now we have to swim.”



Before Ramatu was born, previous generations of Vunidogoloans noticed water levels were rising and the mouth of the river was gradually widening.

By the 1950s, they realised the changes were more than an anomaly.

“In Fiji, we have seasonal weather. But where there should have been rain, there was sun. Where there should have been sun, there was rain. [Our grandparents] understood that the climate had changed,” Ramatu said.

As the decades passed, it got worse. King tides would sweep water into the village, forcing residents to move to higher ground on bamboo rafts. In the 1990s, a young boy drowned after he followed his mother into the river where she was fishing.

“He thought that the river was just on the same level, but it got deep and he couldn’t swim. We just saw the body floating,” Ramatu recalled.

By 2006, regular flooding, soil erosion and the unabated rise of water surrounding their community forced the villagers to ask the Fijian government for help.

In January 2014, Vunidogoloa moved two kilometres inland, becoming the first village in Fiji to relocate because of the effects of climate change.



In Vunidogoloa today, colourful clothes run on lines between identical green wooden houses scattered on a lush hillside, while chickens mill around in the grass.

The 132 villagers are happy here, Ramatu said, as the move has come with new perks.

“We have access to the main road. Children have transportation to school. We’re also close to a health centre,” he said.

But to the headman, these upgrades cannot offset the trauma of leaving the old village.

“Where we were living, we hoped it would be our home forever. We had to leave our beautiful village. It’s painful.”

For much of the world, climate change is a catastrophe unfolding in slow motion, with consequences that can still seemingly be ignored.

But in island nations across the Pacific, climate change has well and truly arrived and is already posing an existential threat to communities.

Rising sea levels have swallowed up five of the Solomon Islands since the mid-20th century.

For Kiribati, a small island nation made up of coral atolls, rising waters pose a threat so dire that in 2014 the government purchased a 20-square-kilometre piece of land in Fiji, to be used to re-settle climate refugees.

Fiji itself has recorded a six-millimetre sea level increase each year since 1993. And that’s just the beginning.

“The worst-case scenario is that we would be looking at one to three metres of sea-level rise [in the next 100 years],” said Elisabeth Holland, director of the Pacific Centre for the Environment and Sustainable Development at the University of the South Pacific.

“We’re looking at significant changes from here on out, so we need to have strong plans in place,” Holland told Al Jazeera.

Rising sea levels aren’t Fiji’s only concern, however.

Tropical cyclones are predicted to increase in intensity in the region. In February 2016, Fiji was struck by the most powerful tropical cyclone to ever hit the country. Cyclone Winston killed 44 Fijians and caused more than $1bn worth of damage.

With nearly one-third of all Fijians currently living in areas prone to these environmental disasters, the government announced last November that 43 villages would need to move to higher ground.

But, said Holland, “What many of these villagers want is to stay exactly where they are, where they’ve been for generations, where their ancestors are buried.

“Many of these villages have been there for the last 100 years. Any time you have to move your home – and this is not a choice that’s in their hands – it’s a terrible challenge.”

Marica Bulimaitoga sits on the doorstep of her small house, a stilted shack made with corrugated tin sheets on a hillside in Vunisavisavi, a small village of 67 residents on Vanua Levu.

Peeling the taro she will cook for dinner, she recalled refusing to leave the house she and her husband built down by the shoreline – even while it was being torn down.

“I was crying, crying, day and night. For three days I slept there without a roof, without a mosquito net. I wanted to stay in my old house,” Bulimaitoga said.



Bulimaitoga moved into her new shelter about two years ago. The cyclone-proof house was one of four donated by USAID, theUnited States‘ development agency. The project was inaugurated just weeks before Cyclone Winston hit Fiji.

“We talked about it with the whole village and most of the villagers didn’t agree to moving. My mother was one of them,” Bulimaitoga’s 24-year-old son, Lorima, who is the headman of Vunisavisavi, told Al Jazeera.

The family’s old home has been reduced to a concrete base and several wooden beams sticking out of the ground, much like the remnants of Ramatu’s first house.

The soil around it is wet and soft, not suitable for keeping a foundation in place.

The shoreline has changed, Lorima said, standing by the remains of the house where he grew up.

“See that tree there, there was grass along that. Now it’s sitting on the sand,” he said.



When king tides and heavy rains coincide, half the village floods, Lorima said. The water would often come into the house. “During cyclones, we would see our cupboards floating on the waves,” he said.

But living down by the shore also meant proximity to food.

“Living down here, it’s easy for us to go out to the sea, get some fish. Now that we have moved up the hill, we have to carry our gear and our food back up,” he said.

For his mother, who is 65 years old, going down to the beach has become especially difficult.



Vunisavisavi’s shoreline has important cultural significance, too.

The first paramount chief ofCakaudroveprovince, Ro Kevu, was installed and lived there before moving to a small island just off the coast.

“This village is a historical site. The people living here, we have an ancestral duty to look after this place,” Lorima said.

Still, it was Lorima who convinced his mother to move into the cyclone-proof home.

“I told [my parents], just a few weeks from now and you will be gone,” he said, smiling mischievously at the morbidity of his own words.

Lorima is among a younger generation of Fijians who appear more willing than their parents to move away from ancestral grounds. He said the next generation of Vunisavisavians should build houses further up the hill, where their children can be safe.

“There’s a new generation coming,” Lorima said.



Three Fijian villages, including Vunidogoloa, have been completely relocated and two are in the initial stages of moving. One more village beside Vunisavisavi underwent a partial relocation.

That leaves about 40 villages earmarked for relocation in the short to medium term.

And these may be just the tip of the iceberg: In 2015, a Fijian official said the government was looking at possibly relocating as many as 676 villages.

Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Fiji’s minister of economy, who is also responsible for the country’s climate change policy, said he hopes the risks posed by climate change can be mitigated through different methods, such as building seawalls.

“You try and minimise the relocations, but of course in some cases you have to do it,” Sayed-Khaiyum told Al Jazeera.

The Fijian government contributed more than $345,000 to the relocation of Vunidogoloa, while the villagers themselves paid about $100,000 – and that’s just one village.

“It’s not just a question of relocating homes. You have to make sure that you have a water system, a sewer system in place. Roads must be built to give them access to other parts. All of these things need to be taken into account,” Sayed-Khaiyum said.

Fiji is vulnerable to the effects of climate change not just because of its geography, but also because the size of its economy makes the country less able to cope financially.

Areportcompiled by the Fijian government and the World Bank said Fiji will need to spend $4.5bn over the next 10 years on measures to adapt to climate change – an amount that’s nearly as much as the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

Sayed-Khaiyum said money is not the only thing Fiji is short on.

“Small island countries face the challenge of being able to have the construction capacity … After Winston, [Fiji] ran out of cement because there was so much simultaneous building going on,” he said.

What makes this an especially bitter pill to swallow is that Fiji and other Pacific nations have contributed almost nothing to global warming. In 2014, Fiji’s carbon emissions made up less than 0.004 percent of the worldwide total.

“We’ve always said that the effects of climate change do not recognise borders,” Sayed-Khaiyum said.

For some of the relocations, Fiji has received financial assistance from organisations including theEUand the German development agency, GIZ. But within the country,climate change needs to be a central tenet of policymaking.

Fiji is one of just a few countries in the world where climate change policy falls under the ministry of the economy.

“The whole idea is to mainstream climate change and also tie it in with planning,” Sayed-Khaiyum explained.

Last October, Fiji became the first emerging market to issue green bonds. The $50m raised will be used for climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.

“We are where we are … Let’s focus on what we can do. Let’s focus on the ones that have some immediate need,” Sayed-Khaiyum said.

In Vunidogoloa, that immediate need has now subsided. Heavy rains and king tides no longer threaten to inundate the village.

But the pain of moving away is still felt by the villagers.

“We still have our old cemetery here [in the old site], and we have our new cemetery there,” Ramatu said.

“That’s one of the painful issues of moving – that we left our grandparents behind.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2018/2/14/in-fiji-villages-need-to-move-due-to-climate-change
Climate change,Climate change could displace 216 million by 2050: Report,"Climate change could push more than 200 million people to leave their homes by 2050 unless urgent action is taken, the World Bank has warned.

In a landmark report published on Monday, the international financial institution called on states to reduce global emissions and bridge the development gap to avoid the effects of slow-onset climate change such as water scarcity, decreasing crop productivity, and rising sea levels.

“All these issues are fundamentally connected, which is why our support to countries is positioned to deliver on climate and development objectives together while building a more sustainable, safe and resilient future,” Juergen Voegele, vice president of Sustainable Development at the World Bank, said in a statement.

Under the most pessimistic scenario, the World Bank’s Groundswellreportpredicts more than 216 million people across six world regions could be on the move by 2050, leading to “hotspots of internal climate migration” by 2030 that will continue to spread and intensify by 2050.

Sub-Saharan Africa has been identified as the most vulnerable region due to desertification, fragile coastlines and the population’s dependence on agriculture. Up to 86 million people are projected to move within national borders in the worst-case scenario.

North Africa may see 19 million “climate migrants” moving, equivalent to roughly 9 percent of its population.

In the most climate-friendly scenario, with low emissions and sustainable development, the world could still see 44 million people being forced to leave their homes.







The findings “reaffirm the potency of climate to induce migration within countries”, said Viviane Wei Chen Clement, a senior climate change specialist at the World Bank and one of the report’s authors.

The first part of the Groundswell report, focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, was published in 2018. The sequel, which includes projections and analysis of internal climate migration for East Asia and the Pacific, North Africa, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, was published on Monday.

The report did not look at the short-term impacts of climate change, such as the effects of extreme weather events, and did not examine climate migration across borders.

“Globally, we know that three out of four people that move stay within countries,” Kanta Kumari Rigaud, a lead environmental specialist at the World Bank and co-author of the report, said.

Among the actions recommended were achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century and investing in green development in line with the Paris agreement.

The report comes before the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, scheduled to take place in November.

Climate change,China provinces top list of regions at risk from climate change,"China is home to more than three-quarters of the regions most at risk from climate change, with some of the world’s most important manufacturing centres threatened by extreme weather, according to a new report.

China’s eastern Jiangsu province ranks as the world’s most climate-vulnerable region, followed by Shandong, Hebei and Henan, according to the report released on Monday by climate risk specialists XDI.

In total, China is home to 16 of the world’s 20 most at-risk regions, according to XDI.

“We’re already feeling the significant impacts of weather events around the world, and they will only increase,” XDI Chief Executive Rohan Hamden told reporters.

“Finally, we just want to make sure that every investment decision is made in a climate-resilient way.”

After China, the United States is home to the most at-risk areas, according to XDI.

Florida, which is ranked 10th globally, is the US state most under threat, followed by California and Texas.

Nine areas of India also made the top 50 at-risk regions. Other major economic centres in the top 100 include Argentina’s Buenos Aires, Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City, and Indonesia’s Jakarta.

In Europe, Germany’s Lower Saxony region is deemed the most vulnerable to climate change. Italy’s Veneto region, which contains the city of Venice, is ranked the fourth most at-risk region in Europe.

XDI’s analysis assessed 2,600 territories globally, modelling damage from 1990 to 2050 based on the “pessimistic” scenario of a 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit)rise in global temperaturesby the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Researchers said the findings highlight the massive potential economic fallout from climate change and the need for governments to ramp up efforts to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to extreme weather events.

“Folks who are looking to build a factory, establish a supply chain that involves those states and provinces are going to think twice about where they are,” said Karl Mallon, XDI’s head of science and innovation.

Investors may apply “risk pricing” to vulnerable regions or “try and find safer havens”, Mallon said.

“There is a lot to be done to work out which areas in the world are potentially adaptable and defendable, and which are probably the areas we will see abandoned in due course,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/2/20/china-provinces-top-list-of-regions-at-risk-from-climate-change
Climate change,"School students strike worldwide, demand action on climate change","Hundreds of thousands of youth worldwide are participating in a school strike, demanding action on climate change, heeding a call by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg to hold demonstrations across the world on Friday.

Teenagers on the streets of Paris warned governments on Friday there would be no summer let-up in their efforts to push for stronger action on climate change, as international green campaigners called a global strike for September 20.









“I should be at school, revising for my French baccalaureat – but I’d rather be here, for my future,” said Jules, 17, who only wanted to give his first name.

He and five friends decided to skip school despite end-of-year exams creeping up, to participate in what is thought to have been one of the biggest global climate actions by young people yet, mobilising hundreds of thousands.

Organisers expect strikes and demonstrations to happen in more than 1,600 places in 110 countries – from New Zealand to Syria and Venezuela.

By 19:00 GMT, nearly 2,500 strikes had been registered on the Fridays for Future website, with the number likely to rise.

The students are following in the footsteps of 16-year-old Thunberg who has been credited with starting the movement.

Forty weeks ago, the Swedish climate activist started skipping school every Friday to protest climate change outside Stockholm’s parliament, inspiring a large global strike on March 15, in which an estimated 1.5 million young people took part.

“I think politicians around the world think the movement will fade and that people will stop striking, especially with the summer break coming up,” said Laure Miro, 16, striking for the second time in Paris.

“The strikes keep getting bigger, more and more people are getting involved and we are very determined. We’re not going to stop here, after all this work,” she said. “Greta spoke out so we could act.”

School strikers said they would kick-start a week of action, starting on September 20 with a worldwide strike for the climate, before a key summit on climate change organised by the secretary-general of theUnited Nationson September 23.

Bill McKibben, a founding member of global climate campaign 350.org, said adults would join the young people by “walking out of our workplaces and homes”.

“We hope to make it a turning point in history,” he said in a statement on Friday.

Thunberg – who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize – is urging governments to declare a climate emergency as has happened in Britain, Scotland and Ireland, a call echoed by many on European strikes.

Thunberg told thousands of supporters gathered in Stockholm’s banking district on Friday that this week’sEuropean electionsshould be focused on tackling climate change.

“But it isn’t. Not at all,” she said.

“If we don’t do it at the European Union level, or even on a global scale, it will be pointless,” said Anthony Didelet, a 17-year-old student in Paris.

“With the European elections coming up [in France], I think this is the time to make ourselves heard.”

In Barcelona, more than 200 people – from school pupils to university students and families with young children – braved the rain, shouting slogans such as “Change the system, not the climate” and “No to pollution”.

Many waved homemade banners written in English, and the march ended outside city hall where a timer with red sand was placed to symbolise how time is running out to act on the “climate emergency” and speakers urged politicians to step up.

In Rio de Janeiro, a small group of students gathered outside the state legislature to deliver a letter dated from the future in which they lamentedBrazil‘s loss of coastline, rainforests and species.

“We, the Brazilians of the future, are also asking you: Is there anything more important than protecting life and ensuring a quality future for the next generations? No, there is not,” they wrote.

In more than a dozen other cities throughout the country, youth also staged strikes and took to the streets, using the issue to challenge the environmental policies of the far-right government of PresidentJair Bolsonaro.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/5/24/school-students-strike-worldwide-demand-action-on-climate-change
Climate change,"Climate change is an emergency for everyone, everywhere","In the run-up to COP26, much of the conversation has dealt with predictions about the future and forthcoming pledges for more decisive action: carbon neutral by 2030, net zero by 2050.

But for millions of people around the world, climate change is already a daily reality.









Ninety percent of refugees under UNHCR’s mandate, and 70 percent of people displaced within their home countries by conflict and violence, come from countries on the front lines of the climate emergency.

They are vulnerable not only to extreme weather like floods or cyclones, but also to seeing their livelihoods dry up due to drought and desertification.

From Burkina Faso to Bangladesh, and from Afghanistan to Mozambique, climate change is increasing poverty, instability and human movement; it is fuelling tensions and competition over dwindling resources.

Outbreaks of violence and extreme weather push people who have already fled once to flee again. But even if peace is restored, displaced people cannot go back if their home areas have been made uninhabitable by drought, floods or rising sea levels.

What we are seeing now is a devastating convergence of conflict and climate change that is both driving displacement and making life even more precarious for those already forced to flee.

Some of the most climate-vulnerable countries are mired in conflicts that have lasted for decades and devastated generations.

In Afghanistan – one of the most fragile countries in the world suffering from four decades of conflict – the compounding impacts of climate change are having profound consequences for those least able to cope. UNHCR has worked in Afghanistan for more than 40 years. I personally served in the country for several years. The protracted conflict has had an irrevocable effect – forcing people to leave the country but also causing internal displacement.

A prolonged drought meant many Afghans were struggling to feed their families even before recent developments left the economy on the verge of collapse. Any further deterioration of the humanitarian situation will almost inevitably lead to yet more displacement in a country where 665,000 people have already been forced from their homes this year.

To many readers in wealthier countries, this may seem like a distant problem in distant lands. But the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in August that irreversible changes in the Earth’s climate are being observed in every region. This year alone, catastrophic flooding killed more than 200 people in Europe, heatwaves caused deaths in Canada, and wildfires have raged in Siberia, across the Mediterranean and along the western coasts of the United States and Canada.

The world is finally waking up to the fact that climate change is an emergency for everyone, everywhere. The stark reality, though, is those who did the least to contribute to it are already suffering the most.

If some of the most prosperous and advanced nations have struggled to help their populations recover and adapt to an increasingly unpredictable climate, what does this mean for a country like Mozambique? One of the least developed countries in the world, it is grappling with violent attacks that have displaced more than 730,000 people while struggling to recover from a series of cyclones, including Cyclone Idai in March 2019 – one of the worst storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere.

The longer we delay global action and support to countries like Mozambique, so they can mitigate the effects of climate change, the worse the consequences will be.

Estimates predict that without ambitious climate action, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance due to disasters could increase to 200 million annually by 2050 – twice the current number.

What can we do and what are we doing?

UNHCR has operations in more than 130 countries and 70 years of experience protecting the displaced. We are using this expertise and knowledge to help countries with limited means and resources to better anticipate and respond to displacement caused by disasters. In places where people are already displaced, we are helping them prepare for and adapt to climate change.

In Bangladesh, for example, UNHCR and partners have been helping Rohingya refugees reduce the risk of flooding and landslides during monsoon season by planting fast-growing trees to stabilise hillsides, providing alternative energy sources to firewood for cooking, and training refugee volunteers as first responders.

We are ready to step up our response, but we need help to do so. Some of the solutions will be financial; some of them technical. But most will need to come from communities on the front lines of the climate emergency. Their voices must be heard at COP and beyond. They have generational knowledge of the land, and therefore, ancestral solutions which can be applied.

The human costs of climate change are here and now. If our collective efforts to drastically reduce emissions and limit global warming fall short, the landscape in which UNHCR operates today risks becoming a universal reality.

Younger generations are rightfully fighting for their future human rights. We are now beyond pledges – we need action and accountability.

Climate change,The West will not act on climate change until it feels its pain,"If there is anything that has been true in the history of the world, it is that states, and especially Western states, rarely if ever act out of a sense of moral compulsion, when such acts could impose hardships back home. Look at the rhetoric around support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion as an example.

While the conflict has been presented in starkly moralistic terms, as the West helping brave Ukraine stand up to Russian bullies, it has been clear that moralism can be quickly discarded in the face of discomfort for their citizens. The prospect of cold European homes and high prices motivated the European Union to leave a myriad of loopholes in its sanctions to allow for the flow of Russian gas and oil to continue. When Russian gas was cut off, European governments did not hesitate to reach out to various fossil fuel-rich autocrats they otherwise regularly criticise for their dismal human rights record.









As Africans learned long ago during the Cold War, global powers are more than happy to wage supposed wars of principle on other peoples’ lands, sacrificing other peoples’ welfare but not their own.

The same dynamic is evident in the narratives and proposals that were tabled at the latest United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Lots of the talk was about helping the unfortunately-situated “Global South” cope with the ravages of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods, and helping them transition into greener sources of energy.

Like during the Cold War, the West is actively theatre-shopping, recruiting countries to serve as arenas for its climate fight. Switzerland, for example, plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, not by actually reducing them, which might require inconveniencing its citizens, but bypayingcountries like Ghana to reduce its emissions and give it credit.

The idea would be for the Swiss government to pay for efficient lighting and cleaner stoves to be installed in Ghanaian households and claim the resulting reduction in emissions as its own. Switzerland is not the only Western nation to use such carbon-offsetting schemes, which displace climate action from rich polluting nations and frame poorer nations that have contributed little to the crisis as the ones that need to change the most.

They were very much present at COP 27, too. The United States, for example, unveiled a new carbon trading scheme that supposedly would help poorer nations transition to cleaner energy. In it, large Western companies would invest in renewable energy projects in the Global South in exchange for being allowed to continue emitting large quantities of greenhouse gases. As environmentalists have pointed out, this is little more than another scheme allowing Western Big Business to continue polluting and reaping large profits.

However, Western talk about transition by poorer countries is not only about deflecting from a focus on their reluctance to decarbonise their own economies and shifting the blame for the climate problems to those least responsible for them. It is also an example of what 19th-century German economist Friedrich List called “kicking away the ladder”.

“It is a very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him,” he wrote in 1841.

While List applied this to the familiar prescriptions of free trade by the British who had themselves clambered up the ladder of mercantilism, it is just as applicable to today’s push by the West to have others not follow their energy path to the top, while they keep the advantages of such ascension – an approach they have also applied to nuclear weapons technology.

In response, many non-Western countries have been keen to either highlight the injustice of having to bear the cost of mitigating extreme weather events caused by others. They have also appealed to the Western sense of self-preservation by arguing, as the prime minister of the Bahamashas, that climate change would send hordes of refugees to Europe, overwhelming the systems of privilege the West has built to insulate itself from the problems it has caused in the rest of the world.

However, both these approaches accept a faulty premise: that climate change is primarily a problem for the Global South, with the West escaping largely unscathed, yet again managing to outsource the pain to the rest of the globe.

Yet, a report from the World Meteorological Organization released on November 2 said “temperatures in Europe have increased at more than twice the global average over the past 30 years – the highest of any continent in the world” and predicted “exceptional heat, wildfires, floods and other climate change impacts will affect society, economies and ecosystems”.

Just this year, the effects of this have been startlingly visible. The region suffered extreme heatwaves that caused the worst drought in half a millennium, dried up rivers and reservoirs, fuelled wildfires that destroyed more than 660,000 hectares (1.63 million acres) of land and killed at least 15,000 people. Further west, states in the US are battling a 22-year megadrought, the worst in a millennium, and across North America, water levels in rivers, lakes and reservoirs are dropping.

Rather than appealing to the West’s conscience or pushing the tale that they will only be indirectly affected by the folly of their actions, the world should borrow the language of JRR Tolkien in The Hobbit: “If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together.”

The fact is, the West has just as much to lose, if not more, than the rest of us, from the climate crisis. Using the tropes of the 1990s’ humanitarian appeals that portray Global South folk as helpless victims will only inspire the same superficial, charitable responses that are designed to make the giver look and feel good, rather than address the problem – as Switzerland has demonstrated.

Rather than saving Brazilian rainforests, maybe a better and more impactful discussion would be what to do about the drying Seine. Rather than the image of climate change being floods in Pakistan, perhaps it should be the thousands dying in heatwaves in the United Kingdom.

In the end, it is not our pain and suffering that will move the West in any meaningful way. It is a recognition of their own. And only when we change the conversation can we expect that to happen.

Climate change,Cox’s Bazar: Rohingya camp to be hardest hit by climate change,"Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh –At first when they came, Dilfaraz, a stout 41-year-old Bangladeshi woman, could not find it in her heart to turn them away. She gave the Rohingyas utensils, mattresses, water, whatever they needed to survive.

“We are not [Buddhists] and we are not Hindu, we are Muslim and as Muslims we should help other Muslims,” said the mother of five, who has lived in Kutupalong village since 1999.









Along with neighbouring Balukhali in Cox’s Bazar district, it now hosts the largest refugee camp in the world.

But the goodwill towards refugees has soured over the last year.

Like Dilfaraz, Bangladesh is struggling to accommodate over 1 million Rohingya.

The exodus began in August last year as the predominantly Muslim minority fled an army-backed massacre in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.

Most Rohingya are terrified of returning to Myanmar, which has persecuted them for decades, so it remains unclear for how long Cox’s Bazar will play host to their suffering.

And while the humanitarian crises at the camp have been documented, a different kind of disaster is brewing.

The hilly tracts of Cox’s Bazar could foster an environmental crisis brought on by indiscriminate deforestation and vanishing groundwater reservoirs.

In the long run, this would make the region more prone to the effects of climate change.

If greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, by 2050, Cox’s Bazar will be the worst-hit district in South Asia as average temperatures rise and rainfall patterns become disruptive, aJune 2018 World Bank reportfound. Living standards, measured in household expenditure, could fall by 20 percent by mid-century.

Cox’s Bazar, a strip of land wedged between Myanmar to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west, has sheltered Rohingya refugees over the decades during ethnic clashes in Myanmar.

Some stayed while others returned as tensions subsided.

But this time it is different; entire villages have migrated en masse with little to return to.

Nur, 25, who works for Dilfaraz’s brother, and says she is grateful to have support in the form of comfortable shelter.

“I am not being paid, but they helped us out in our time of need,” Nur said.

Her family of eight hails from Buthidaung in Myanmar’s Rakhine state.

“When we came, it (Cox’s Bazar) looked like a jungle, people just choose their own place to build a shelter, and the whole jungle was destroyed,” Nur recounted.

The settlement is now spread across 5,800 acres, and much of it cleared forest land.

Over 95 percent of the refugees collect fuelwood directly from the forests or buy it in the market. A tiny fraction use LPG cylinders (liquefied petroleum gas) provided by NGOs.

The loss of forests and land degradation is dangerous for the precariously placed camps.

“In Bangladesh these are not rocky hills, they are soft soil hills. The stability comes from the roots of the trees, if you cut the trees you have destabilised the terrain and there is a risk of hill collapse,” A Atiq Rahman, executive director, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS), said.

Vigorous monsoons make the area prone to landslides and there is always the lurking threat of cyclones. Disappearing forests are also a sore spot for locals who have watched a vital resource become scarce.

In the initial months, shallow tube wells that pump water from about 150 feet were constructed quickly with little oversight. Many shallow tube wells could run dry as demand peaks in summer.

In the cramped camps, toilets pits were constructed close to water withdrawal points. Water samples from over 70 percent of wells were contaminated by E. coli, according to WHO.

New tube wells are plumbing deeper into the poorly mapped aquifer.

Nearby in the camp, a new 650-feet deep hand pump has brought much-needed relief to the refugees.

The initial response in the face of political uncertainty is not translating well into a long-term strategy.

“They are still working in emergency mode,” said Saleemul Huq, director of Bangladesh-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development, highlighting the need for environmental monitoring. “The long-term impacts are very uncertain.”

The World Bank report does not take into account the impacts of the current refugee influx, but notes that deforestation has led to major landslides and harmed property and water resources in the area.

“Since Cox’s Bazar lags behind the national average in key development indicators such as education, access to electricity, water availability, market access and has a greater share of agricultural households, it may therefore become more vulnerable to the effects of temperature rise,” said Muthukumara Mani, lead author of the World Bank report.

The report recommends investment in socio-economic development to overcome climate change impacts.

But Cox’s Bazar will struggle to do that if the refugee situation remains unresolved.

“Poverty may increase due to depletion of assets, labour competition, and the impact of the cyclone and monsoon seasons,” aJoint Response Plan 2018prepared by UN agencies in conjunction with the Bangladeshi government, said, warning that “the current situation risks slowing — and even reversing — efforts towards socio-economic development of the district.”

Resentment is brewing among locals as the camps become a fixture of the landscape.

Dilfaraz believes that people living next to the camp have paid the heaviest price, while businesses that support the vast machinery of aid have prospered.

“The Bangladeshi government has to find a solution,” she said.

A plan to repatriate the refugees formulated by the Bangladeshi and Myanmar government, has failed to take off. International agencies have criticised the two governments for ignoring the wishes of the Rohingyas.

Terrors of their homeland continue to haunt refugees. Mamtaj, 30, is the mother of two boys and one girl, but only her seven-year-old daughter survived.

Soldiers shot her husband, she said. Her five-year-old son was snatched from her arms and thrown into a fire. The 11-year old was shot dead.

“There were two men, one held me down by my head and arms and the other raped me,” Mamtaj recounted.  “I will never go back to Burma.”

Climate change,"Climate change gets ‘highest priority’ in US, Pacific agreement","The United States and Pacific island nations have signed up to a new era of cooperation, making climate change the “highest priority” and promising to work together to ensure a peaceful region where “democracy is allowed to flourish”.

TheDeclaration on US-Pacific Partnership, signed by 14 Pacific island nations, came at the end of an unprecedented two-day summit in Washington, DC, which took place five months after a security deal between the Solomon Islands and China raised concern about Beijing’s growing influence in the region.

“We honored the history and values that our nations share and expanded our cooperation on key areas that will benefit our people for years to come,” US President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter after the summit concluded.

The 11-point declaration included a commitment to economic and infrastructure development, strengthening regional cooperation — with the US promising to deepen ties with the Pacific Islands Forum — as well as maritime security and “the sustainable use of the Pacific Ocean based on the rule of law”.

Of particular concern to the Pacific Islands, which risk being submerged beneath rising seas, was an explicit commitment to tackling climate change.

“We take the climate crisis as the highest priority of our partnership, for it remains the single greatest existential threat to the livelihoods, security, traditional and customary practices, and wellbeing of people in the Pacific region,” the declaration said.

Leaders and representatives endorsing the declaration included Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who had been reported earlier not to be planning to sign. Kiribati, a state of 115,000 which did not send a representative, was not on the list. It was one of two Pacific countries, the other being the Solomon Islands, thatswitched diplomatic relationsfrom Taipei to Beijing in 2019.

The US iscourting the Pacific island nationsas Beijing becomes increasingly active in the region. Some leaders have expressed concern about Beijing, which wasunable to secure a regional security agreement, but they are also worried they might be caught in the middle of the increasing rivalry between the two superpowers.

As leaders gathered in Washington, DC, the US announced it would invest more than $810m in expanded programmes to aid the islands, on top of more than $1.5bn provided over the past decade.

The renewed largesse from the US, which has been criticised for neglecting the region, was largely welcomed.

“It is true that the USA is a little late,” Robert Bohn, adviser to Vanuatu’s foreign minister and a former legislator in the island country, told Al Jazeera. “That being said, financial assistance is never too late. Our main need is infrastructure. Australia and New Zealand are our friends, but they have been concentrating on the soft parts of government. We need roads, airports, maritime infrastructure.”

The declaration also addressed US atomic testing in the Marshall Islands from 1946-1958, saying Washington would deal with the islanders’ environmental and public health concerns.

A week ago, the Marshall Islands suspended talks with the US on renewing the two countries’ strategic partnership, known as the Compact of Free Association Agreement, over the issue.

“World War II ended nearly 80 years ago, but its scars remain in the Pacific,” the declaration said. “We, too, acknowledge the nuclear legacy of the Cold War.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/30/climate-change-gets-highest-priority-in-us-pacific-agreement
Climate change,How Bangladesh’s poor are paying the costs of climate damage,"WhenCyclone Yaasslammed into her home in southwest Bangladesh in May, destroying it and sweeping away in the floodwaters the small amount of cash she had saved, Amina Begum had few options.

Efforts to recover from four previous cyclones since 2009 had depleted her resources, and her husband’s death five years ago left the burden of caring for their two children solely to her.

So Begum took the only option available: She sold her gold wedding earrings, her last valuables, for 5,000 Bangladesh taka ($58) and moved with her children to Notun Bazar, a slum in Khulna, the nearest big city.

“There was nothing else left to me,” she said, standing in the narrow alleyways of her new neighbourhood, where the pungent smell of rotting food fills the air and mosquitoes torment residents at night.

She now earns about 400 taka ($4.70) a day as a day labourer in the city, most of which goes to pay for the tiny rooms she rents. She said she no longer has any savings.







As climate change disasters and losses surge around the world, the world’s poorest, who can least afford it, arepaying the bulk of the costs, making them effectively the world’s “silent financiers” of climate losses and adaptation efforts, researchers say.

That is a reality largely still unrecognised internationally, said Paul Steele, the chief economist for the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).

The poor in countries such as Bangladesh are facing an “impossible situation” trying to pay for losses they and others in poor countries – most of them low contributors to climate-changing emissions – did not cause, he said.

In total, rural families in Bangladesh are estimated to be spending 158 billion taka (almost $2bn) a year in repairingclimate damageor trying to prevent it, research by IIED, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Britain’s Kingston University found.

That is twice the amount contributed by the country’s government, which has its own national climate fund, and 12 times what Bangladesh gets from international donors, researchers found.

Mamunur Rashid, a climate change specialist with UNDP’s Bangladesh office, said the spending is diverting cash away from efforts by families to improve their lives, leaving the poor increasingly permanently stranded.

“Lots of climate-affected people in Bangladesh are fighting with all their means to adapt to climate change. This financial flow from their own development aspiration to combat climate change is not recognised as climate finance,” he said, calling the poor “the most silent financier”.

Such flows of cash are hardly unique to Bangladesh, he added, suggesting overall global spending by families on climate adaptation and losses almost certainly outstrips national and international spending.

That flood of private cash should be counted in global tallies of climate finance, he said, noting that a failure by big-emitting rich countries to financially help poorer ones deal with the consequences is set to have a big effect on everything from global security to the planet’s health.

In 2009, wealthy nations agreed to raise $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries develop cleanly and adapt toclimate change impacts.

But after failing to meet that goal, the governments admitted prior to the COP26 UN climate talks in Glasgow that the pledge would only be met starting in 2023 – though they promised to make up the backlog.

UN chief Antonio Guterres has called for half of the climate spending to go to adaptation efforts, up from just 27 percent of public climate finance in 2019.

The United States, the European Union and other developed countries have, as well, so far resisted efforts to create a separate pot of funding to help poor countries deal with surging “loss and damage” from climate impacts.

The Glasgow Climate Pact, agreed last month, notably failed to secure the establishment of a dedicated new damages fund that vulnerable nations had pushed for at the summit.

That has left vulnerable poor people to pick up the tab from growing climate losses in their communities and countries, IIED researchers said.

In Bangladesh, where they surveyed 1,320 flooded households, they found nearly a third had paid to raise the floors of their homes, for instance, while others had invested in better protection for their animals or other measures.

The costs are hitting homes headed by women hardest, they said, with females members spending a higher percentage of their income than men on efforts to try to protect their families and property.

Women were also more likely than men to make efforts to adapt to rising risks, the survey found.

But for many, the push to adapt is not standing up to increasingly severe floods, storms and other climate change effects.

Momena Banu, of Chilmari, a flood-prone area of northern Bangladesh, in May saw her home swept away in early monsoon floods.

With her husband having earlier moved to Dhaka to find work – and then having left her for another woman there – she had little alternative but to sell her two cows to buy food and build a temporary home along a raised road in Chilmari.

Today she remains there, without any savings or assets to restart her life.

Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Dhaka, said the poor will continue to pay the costs of climate change unless they get help.

“National governments and the global community must support them better,” he urged.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/13/how-bangladeshs-poor-are-paying-the-costs-of-climate-damage
Climate change,China’s global climate change challenge to the West,"In front of the world’s leaders at the United Nations General Assembly last month, China’s President Xi Jinping pledged that his country “will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad.” This decision is a major step towards aligning global finance with our collective climate and development goals and it could help build momentum for private sector defunding of coal energy production as well.

Since the global financial crisis of 2008, China’s two global policy banks, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, have brought a stepwise increase in public finance for energy and infrastructure that has been filling major financial gaps and fostering economic growth in emerging market and developing countries.









At Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center, we compile databases that track China’s overseas development finance in general and energy in particular. According to our research, these two banks provided upwards of $460bn to foreign governments between 2008 and 2019, roughly equivalent to what the World Bank has distributed during the same period.

We also estimated that between 2007 and 2016, China’s policy banks provided some $197bn in finance to foreign governments for energy – nearly matching the total financing of all the major Western-backed MDBs combined. In work with Princeton University colleagues, we found that Chinese finance was the equivalent to 42 percent of the power generation capacity financed by the 10 largest MDBs.

While China must be credited with filling infrastructure finance gaps in a growth-enhancing manner, the composition of that finance, especially in the energy sector, is concentrated in heavily carbon-intensive sectors. Coal, oil, gas, and hydroelectric power in tropical forests dominate Chinese energy financing. Such financing poses risks to the global climate, public health, and biodiversity.

Around the time of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, most of the MDBs started phasing out overseas coal finance, and in May 2021 the G7 pledged “to take concrete steps towards an absolute end to new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation by the end of 2021”.

Then China’s announcement came in September this year. Initially, there was some concern that the language of the pledge did not appear as clear as that of the G7. Some wondered if pledging not to “build” new coal plants truly meant financing coal.

However, shortly after’s Xi’s UN speech, the Bank of China announced that it would stop financing overseas coal mining and power plants this year. In one fell swoop, China matched the G7 pledge and upped the game to where the real action is – in the commercial and private sector.

More than 80 percent of all newly added coal generation capacity outside China between 2013 and 2019 was financed by non-Chinese entities. Among the largest lenders to the global coal industry are Japanese firms such as Mizuho Financial and SMBC Group and American financial giants such as Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan. The Bank of China was also among the top lenders to the coal industry until its recent pledge.

Now that the world’s major governments have led by example and banned overseas coal plants, and the Bank of China has joined them, it is time for the private sector to follow suit. Without private financial institutions buying into defunding coal energy production, we will not meet our global climate and development goals.

Moving forward, two things are imperative. First, the West must put pressure on the private sector to phase out coal as well. Second, rather than turning off the spigot, global financial actors need to shift the composition of energy finance towards cleaner energy such as wind and solar power.

China and the West should not cut off energy finance to countries in need. Rather, they should replace coal finance with support for wind and solar power, two industries where China is most dominant.

In a recent paper, we found that there are renewable energy opportunities worth $1 trillion in developing countries, based on these countries’ own plans through their Nationally Determined Contributions for the Paris Agreement. Given China’s dominance in these sectors and the prowess of its policy banks, if it channels its tremendous capital, technology and know-how towards these plans, it can dramatically expand green energy access throughout the developing world.

Such a move is not only good climate policy, but good banking. The West should follow suit.

Climate change,We need to change the way we talk about climate change,"Ina January 19articleabout the impacts of climate change inBangladesh,New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristofdescribes a coastal island on the verge of disappearance and farmers forced to “marry off” their underage daughters as a result of losses linked to sea level rise. This dystopic imaginary of Bangladesh in the time of climate change iswell-worn territory. The key points in this ubiquitous narrative include: a land mass disappearing thanks to sea level rise, wretched and desperate inhabitants watching their land and livelihoods wash away, millions of“climate refugees”flooding outof the small country’s porous borders.

There is no question that climate change is happening – with impacts being felt in Bangladesh as in the rest of the world. Coastal Bangladesh, like coastal Manhattan, will suffer. The inhabitants of both of these communities will have to grapple with an uncertain ecological future.

Yet in narratives like Kristof’s, it is Bangladesh that is the climate sh**hole (albeit one that warrants our pity rather than scorn). These dystopic climate narratives share parallels withDonald Trump’salready-fabled descriptionof “sh**hole countries”migrants from which he believes are not desirable. Even in Kristof’s more humanitarian guise, his narrative similarly conjures up a country defined by powerlessness, inferiority, dependency, and failure.

These sh**hole narratives have real effects. In Bangladesh, the imaginary of an impending (or already existing) climate dystopia has exacerbated the threats faced by coastal communities. It does this by facilitating adaptation interventions that seek to transition people out of rural communities, instead of supporting their continued livelihoods within them. As I document in arecently publishedstudy, these interventions depend upon a vision of development in which urbanisation and export-led growth are both desirable and inevitable. The narratives also ignore long histories of foreign intervention in this coastal ecology that have made Bangladesh exponentially more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This history helps us to see that climate crisis is not, and has never been, inevitable.

The global imaginary of Bangladesh as a dystopic climate 'sh**hole' not only anticipates a future climate crisis, it also produces it.

by

In the 1960s, US and Dutch engineers built a massive system of embankments across Bangladesh’s coast that were intended to expand rice production by closing off the entire coastal estuary and protecting farmland from seasonal monsoon flooding. At the time, it was the pinnacle of experimentation in development engineering schemes.

Unfortunately, the designs created by foreign engineers were entirely unsuited to Bangladesh’s tidal geography. The flawed designs resulted in chronic water-logging and land subsidence: essentially,rapid relativesea level rise. In the 1980s, urban elites in Bangladesh saw an opportunity for using these water-logged coastal lands to cultivate shrimp instead of rice. Responding to growing demand from the US and Europe, and with the support of foreign aid agencies such as USAID and the World Bank, the export industry for frozen shrimp grew quickly. Thesocial and ecologicalimpactsof this expansion have been similarly dramatic. The resulting soil salination has devastated local agricultural production, displacing countless sharecroppers and day labourers who depended on rice farming and subsistence production for their survival. This transition to shrimp cultivation was not inevitable; like the re-engineering of the coastal landscape, it was planned and carried out through outside intervention.

Today, manyoutside development expertsbelievethat agriculture in the region is no longer viable due to climate change. Instead, shrimp aquaculture, which further increases soil salination, thus compounding the experience of climate change for remaining residents, is celebrated as a key strategy in climate change adaptation in coastal Bangladesh. These adaptation strategies reflect the dystopic visions of a climate-changed future in which rural agricultural production in this region is already doomed. They are predicated on the idea that rural livelihoods in this region may not be worth saving. The global imaginary of Bangladesh as a dystopic climate “sh**hole” not only anticipates a future climate crisis, it also produces it.

Despite the varied and extreme challenges faced by the farmers who inhabit this region, some residents have pursued an alternative vision of the future that challenges this bleak imaginary. Members oflandless peasantcollectiveshave mobilised to stem the transition to shrimp cultivation and return to farming rice. Their successes challenge the idea that agrarian production in this region is impossible in the time of climate change. Their efforts make plain that the residents of coastal Bangladesh are not helpless, and are as motivated to secure their own futures as communities in much richer waterfront areas like Manhattan. These residents deserve our solidarity, not our sympathy. Indeed, this solidarity is what climate justice demands of us.

Climate change,‘Dangerous and delusional’: Critics denounce Saudi climate plan,"Under pressure to decarbonise, Saudi Arabia has announced a raft of measures to deal with the intensifying climate crisis, but critics say the moves are just a smokescreen to keep fossil fuels propelling its economy.

After holding the “Middle East Green Initiative” over the weekend, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presented a series of plans to address the dangers of global warming, overwhelmingly caused by rich nations over the past three centuries.

The initiatives included achieving “net-zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2060,planting 50 billion treesin the Middle East in the decades to come, and launching a $10.4bn clean energy project for the region.

The pledges, however, came days after Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, announced it planned to raise crude production from 12 million barrels a day to 13 million barrels by 2027 – a move scientists, energy experts, and activists say goes directly against what is needed to stave off the most catastrophic effects of climate change.

All hydrocarbons must remain in the ground starting now, climate researchers say.

Saudi Arabia has justified the contradictory moves of reducing its own carbon emissions while still taking oil out of the ground and selling it worldwide as part of a plan to create a “circular carbon economy“.

This envisions continuing to extract carbon-filled fuel out of the earth while employing new technologies to capture, store or sell its emissions – essentially an offset scheme.

The Saudis and other traditional energy producers say it is unrealistic simply to turn off the oil-and-gas taps at the moment as fossil fuels will be needed for decades to come during the transition to renewables.

“Demonising the hydrocarbon industry is not going to help anyone,”saidAramco’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser on Saturday. “Decarbonising the economyis not going to help anyone.”







Saudi Arabiapreviously outlined plansto build the world’s largest green hydrogen plant powered by solar and wind energy in its futuristic city Neom.

Riyadh has said its own “Saudi Green Initiative” will involve investments of more than 700 billion riyals ($187bn) by 2030.

Oil and gas economist Cornelia Meyer has praised the kingdom’s “green” economy transformation plans.

“Saudi Arabia is steering a good course with the Saudi and Middle East green initiatives, renewables and green hydrogen projects. It will in the long run also pay off to develop further the CCUS [carbon capture, utilization and storage] technology and the concept of the circular carbon economy, because combating climate change is a long game,” shewrotein the Arab News.

But others have questioned Riyadh’s path in dealing with the escalating climate crisis.

The International Energy Agency (IEA), the world’s top energy body,saidin May that governments and companies must immediately halt investing in new oil-and-gas projects if the world wants to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Questions also surround the current state of carbon capture technology being promoted by the Saudis – technology that is still unproven in its effectiveness and extremely expensive to use for large-scale extraction.

It isn’t difficult to understand why the kingdom would be reluctant to act fast and decisively on walking away from hydrocarbon production.

Saudi Arabia possesses about 16 percent of the world’s proven petroleum reserves.Estimates indicatethe oil and gas sector accounts for about 87 percent of budget revenues, 42 percent of gross domestic product, and 90 percent of export earnings.

However, with ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions and the accompanying global temperature rise – and all the associatedenvironmental devastation– it remains to be seen if carbon capture technology and billions of planted trees can negate the continued mass burning of fossil fuels.







Some critics have accused the Saudis of “greenwashing” – or claiming something is good for the environment when in reality the opposite is true.

Yara M Asi, a non-resident fellow at Arab Center Washington DC, said Saudi Arabia’s carbon capture approach is just one of many needed for the crisis, but she added “alone this strategy is not enough”.

“This is a convenient move if a state is not willing to significantly curtail the amount of carbon they produce, but want the benefits of claiming they are reducing carbon emissions,” Asi told Al Jazeera.

She said the Saudi’s “green” announcements ahead ofthe COP26 summit– such as planting millions of trees over the next few years – were all needed, but the core effort in combatting global warming is halting fossil fuel use.

“Ultimately, these kinds of initiatives produce a good headline for a state or entity while allowing them to avoid dealing with the root causes of climate change and their carbon emissions, which would require a fundamental rethinking of how we build our world and how we power what we build,” Asi said.

Matthew Archer, a researcher at the Graduate Institute Geneva, was more direct when asked by Al Jazeera about Saudi Arabia’s “circular carbon economy” plan.

“It’s absurd to think that an economy based on the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels can be ‘circular’ in any meaningful sense of the word. The only way it works is if you rely on technologies that don’t exist yet,” said Archer.

“These initiatives are … full of language that’s as ambitious as it is ambiguous, with very few concrete plans and no accountability mechanisms.”

Highlighting thedire warnings in the latest reportby the United Nations’ International Panel on Climate Change, he said the only way to rapidly decarbonise to avert catastrophic consequences of global warming is to ban new fossil fuel developments and invest massively in renewable energy and public infrastructure projects.

“Anything short of that isn’t just greenwashing, it’s dangerous and delusional,” said Archer.

MENACW 2022discussions will focus on national actions and economy-wide approaches to climate action, integrated approaches for resilient development and seizing transformative opportunities. Last year, regional collaboration emerged as a driver of global progress. This year, discussions on these topics are set to accelerate action on climate change even further.

Al Jazeera:At current projections, some areas in MENA could see temperatures potentially reaching 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher in the coming decades, rendering them uninhabitable. What adaptation strategies should governments be implementing right now?

Espinosa:In the climate change process, governments are working to limit average global temperature rise to as close to 1.5C [2.7F] as possible. For some places, like the MENA region, even a small increase in average global temperature can create very hot local conditions. It is a real social and economic risk.

Right now, governments should urgently develop and implement national adaptation plans that identify what is needed to adapt to climate impacts and strategies to meet those needs. Finance and support are crucial for developing nations.

At last November’sUN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, governments agreed, among many other issues, that more support for adaptation is urgently needed. MENA Climate Week is an opportunity to carry these decisions forward, discuss regional risks and collaborate on solutions for this region.

Al Jazeera:There is debate around the notion that climate change has been responsible for some regional conflicts and the rise of “extremist” armed groups. What is the UN’s view of the relationship between global warming and armed conflict in MENA?

Espinosa:Climate change is a destabilising phenomenon that can impact food security, water security, energy security and human security. The severity of impacts and potential for social disruption make climate change more than a security threat. Climate change is a grave threat to life as we know it.

According to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, climate change “has a multiplier effect and is an aggravating factor for instability, conflict and terrorism”.

MENA region water, agriculture and energy challenges put the fundamental building blocks of healthy development at risk. This in turn threatens economic security and opens the door to instability and even criminality. Stakeholders in the region should accelerate climate action now to ensure a more stable and prosperous future.

Al Jazeera:Climate change has long been downplayed by governments and the private sector in MENA. Are hydrocarbon-reliant nations now taking the threat more seriously?

Espinosa:The recent IPCC Sixth Assessment report clearly shows that all nations need to take the climate change threat more seriously. We are pushing our planetary boundaries at our own peril, and some of those boundaries are at a breaking point. It’s time for every person, government and business to make decisions that reflect and respect those boundaries.

We have to reduce the global reliance on hydrocarbons and reduce emissions as soon as possible. Transformative change does not happen overnight, but firm plans in every sector to reduce emissions in the next two years will show if nations are truly taking the threat more seriously. Ambitious plans for immediate reductions will also get us on track to meet our mid-century net zero goals.

Al Jazeera:Severe water and food scarcity and the mass movement of “climate refugees” have been forecast as temperatures surge in the Middle East and North Africa. How should governments prepare for these dire predictions?

Espinosa:Right now, governments and stakeholders should urgently accelerate action to avoid the most dire predictions. We are all connected socially and economically and will all be impacted by climate change. We must be connected in action. The greatest thing governments can do is to submit more ambitious NDCs [nationally determinedcontributions].

They can always revise NDCs with bold commitments. And the greatest thing stakeholders can do is transform their policies and practices to achieve those national climate plans. Preparation for climate impacts is a focus of the first Middle East and North Africa Climate Week. Through collaboration, governments and stakeholders develop a better understanding of climate risks, forge partnerships and find solutions.

Al Jazeera:Some nations in the region are promoting the “circular carbon economy” model, in which yet-to-be proven carbon capture methods will be employed during the continuation of fossil fuel extraction. Is this a viable route with the increasingly urgent need to halt greenhouse gas emissions? Or does the strategy undermine ambitious climate policy involving mitigation targets and carbon-pricing mechanisms?

Espinosa:It is very clear that we need to move away from fossil fuels. As we do that, no potential solution to climate change should be overlooked. All innovation should be encouraged, and proven solutions should be urgently implemented. So, we must implement carbon-pricing, renewable energies and other measures to achieve ambitious climate commitments. We need to do that now. In parallel, unproven technologies should be tested and deployed if they can help transform our energy systems and achieve our climate change goals.

MENA Climate Week 2022 is a platform to connect with key stakeholders and share ideas with great potential. Collaboration and innovation are the spark that can ignite transformation here in the MENA region and around the world. We look forward to hearing these ideas now and seeing how they develop on the way toCOP27in Egypt.

Climate change,The ‘ground zero’ of climate change,"



In the middle of the world’s largest delta, an island is disappearing.

Bhola Island is the “ground zero” of climate change, and home to what have been called the world’s first climate refugees.









Bangladesh’s largest island is located where one of the country’s mightiest rivers, the Meghna, meets the Indian ocean at the Bay of Bengal.

Caught between rising sea levels and the increased water pressure of the river, which has its source in the melting Himalayan glaciers, the island is rapidly being eroded.

Rezaul Chowdhury from the Coastal Association for Social Transformation Trust (Coast) explains: “Every second, this river carries one million cubic feet of water down through the Meghna and around Bhola island.

“All of the siltation gathered by the waters in South Asia meet in the Bay of Bengal, along Bhola island, creating the highest amount of river erosion in Bangladesh.”

International scientists count Bangladesh as one of the countries worst hit by climate change.

The country loses an estimated 100 square kilometres of land to river erosion ever year, and nowhere is the situation more dire than on Bhola.

Thousands homeless

Since 1995, half of the island has succumbed to erosion caused by heavier waters and rising sea levels.

Half of the island’s population has been forced to relocate their homes, many fleeing to the teeming slums of Dhaka.

For those who have stayed, life has become increasingly difficult as they watch their land being eaten away by the waters.

“I go where the river takes me, but the waters have become too dangerous for my children, it’s difficult to fish, many of our people have drowned”

Shah Jahan, Bedey or “river gypsy”

Of the land that remains, the invading sea water has swallowed vast areas of rice fields, making food insecurity a great threat to the increasingly cramped 1.5 million inhabitants of the island.

According to Quazi Ahmad, who represented Bangladesh at the 2007 intergovernmental panel on climate change, the entire coastal region has been adversely affected.

“As climate change intensifies, part of the coastal area will be inundated with salt water, and therefore we will lose agricultural land. If action is not taken to reverse the effects of climate change, up to 30 per cent of agricultural productivity may be lost in South Asia.”

Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries on earth, and food security is already precarious.

In Bhola, the situation is already severe enough to demand a serious response. In order to tackle the food shortage, the Bangladesh government is distributing food to villagers who have lost their rice fields to climate change.

Many who have lost their fields have also lost their homes. Those who live along the island’s coastline are particularly vulnerable, and many have been forced to move home several times.

At this rate, it is estimated that in a matter of decades the island could be lost entirely.

Chowdhury predicts: “In 30, 40, 50 years, there will be no Bhola Island.”

If the trend is not reversed, islanders here will join climate refugees from other parts of the country, creating even great pressures on the country’s teeming cities.

‘River gypsies’ threatened

Not only is global warming affecting those on land but it is also affecting those on the water.

The Bedeys, known as river gypsies in Bangladesh, are a unique group of people who spend the majority of each year navigating houseboats on the country’s 700 rivers, estuaries and canals.

“River gypsies” are abandoning their way of life as the water becomes more dangerous

Shah Jahan is one of the thousands of river gypsies that live on the waterways surrounding this island.

Over the past decade, the river he calls home has become unpredictable. Erratic rivers and unpredictable monsoons have forced him to reconsider his nomadic lifestyle.

Speaking from the cozy confines of his houseboat, he says: “I go where the river takes me, but the waters have become too dangerous for my children, it’s difficult to fish, many of our people have drowned, I don’t want my children to share this same fate.”

Many river gypsies who frequent the waters around Bhola Island are now abandoning their houseboats to carve out a space for themselves on land.

A small and distinctive group, there are only 800,000 river gypsies in Bangladesh, and their numbers are dwindling. In the past decade alone, 250,000 have abandoned their traditional way of life.

With a sense of impending doom, Bangladeshis are adamant that something must be done to reverse the climate change which threatens to swallow the country’s islands and shoreline, irrevocably changing the lives of the millions who have their homes there.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2009/12/7/the-ground-zero-of-climate-change
Climate change,‘Code red for humanity’: 5 key climate change facts,"As the COP26 climate change conference gets under way in Glasgow on Sunday, world leaders will likely have their last chance to curtail the deadliest consequences of human-induced planetary warming.

Time is of the essence for unified global action as studies suggest as little as nine years remain before the most catastrophic effects of climate change take hold and are impossible to stop.

“The effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible on the timescale of people alive today, and will worsen in the decades to come,” the US space agency NASA said in abrief.

Here are five things to know about the climate emergency as COP26 begins:

Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat near Earth’s surface and when they become too concentrated, global warming results.

The landmarkParis climate accord in 2015resulted in nations around the world agreeing to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the period before the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1760 in Europe and the United States.

The globe has already warmed 1C (1.8F) above preindustrial levels, and climate disasters are a result. The United Nations estimates to keep warming under 1.5C (2.7F), countries need to reach“net-zero”gas emissions by 2050. But efforts to decarbonise have badly faltered since the Paris agreement.

Global emissions would be 16 percent higher in 2030 than they were in 2010 under current national commitments – nowhere close to a 45 percent reduction by 2030 that scientists say is needed to halt climate catastrophe.

A 16 percent rise would lead to warming of2.7C (4.9F) by the end of the century– a figure meaning life on Earth would be disastrous for millions, if not billions, of people.

Many countries – including the US, the world’s second-largest gas polluter behind China – have pledged to meet the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 or 2060. But a report issued in September by the UN noted climate commitments were so weak that even if pledges are fulfilled temperatures will still rise about 2.7C this century.

This would unleash far more devastating effects than those already hammering countries around the world, from raging floods to out-of-control wildfires and super-storms.

“The world is on a catastrophic pathway to 2.7-degrees of heating,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterresnoted.







COP26 comes after another year of extreme weather disasters, including unprecedented heatwaves around the globe, deadly flooding in the US, Europe, and China, raging wildfires in Greece and Turkey, and deadly storms.

But the future could be far worse if world leaders fail to act to achieve zero emissions. The World Bankwarnedrecently more than 216 million people could be forced from their homes and rendered climate refugees by 2050.

Water scarcity will become a serious problem, decreasing crop productivity, while rising sea levels will lead to uninhabitable environments.

According to one study, envisioning the potential worst scenarios, the world’s most populous cities — including Chennai, Mumbai, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Lagos, Bangkok and Manila — could beabandonedby 2050.

Scorching temperatures will also wreak havoc on people’s lives.

About 35 percent of the global land area and 55 percent of the world’s population would be subject to more than 20 days a year of lethal heat conditions, “beyond the threshold of human survivability”, the papernoted.







While mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero has long been the goal of scientists, the reality is now inescapable that human beings will have to learn to live with the effects of a changing Earth. Planetary warming is here to stay for the foreseeable future and people will have to learn to deal with it.

Efforts to protect societies against the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are now under way around the globe. These include minimising the effects of sea level rise, ocean acidification, shifting precipitation patterns, and increasing temperatures.

“Adaptation can range from building flood defences, setting up early warning systems for cyclones, and switching to drought-resistant crops, to redesigning communication systems, business operations and government policies,”saidthe UN’s climate change agency.

But critics say much more needs to be done. Current finance from donor countries and multilateral development banks dedicated to climate adaptation is about $16.7bn a year, a fraction of the current costs of an estimated $70bn annually.

Adaptation costs are projected to rise to as much as $300bn by 2030. Funding for adaptation must be rapidly scaled up to at least 50 percent of total public climate finance expenditure.

“Far greater efforts are needed to build resilience in vulnerable countries and for the most vulnerable people. They do the least to cause climate change – but bear the worst impacts,” the UN noted.

Leading climate scientists have warned for decades that human activities were filling the atmosphere with heat-trapping gases. However, it has only been in the last few years that plans for action have been developed.

Less than 10 years remain to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts of a warming planet, according to the latestreportfrom the world’s top scientists.

The next 10-20 years will be critical to the survivability of the human species on the planet.

About 70 countries so far have indicated they plan to achieve carbon neutrality goals by 2050.However, the world’s biggest economies – responsible for 80 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions – must lead the way in taking urgent action to avoid climate catastrophe.

“Saving this and future generations is a common responsibility. We are on the verge of the precipice. Wake up. Step back. Change course. Unite,” UN chief Guterres told world leaders in September.

While the grim reality of the climate emergency continues to become ever clearer, there is optimism its worst effects can still be avoided.

“The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was a code red for humanity. But it also made clear that it is not too late to meet the Paris Agreement 1.5-degree target. We have the tools to achieve this target. But we are rapidly running out of time,” said Guterres.

Immediate and drastic improvements in climate action plans are desperately needed from most countries.

However, the tools are there with increasingly affordable technology to help reach net-zero emissions by the middle of the century.

Renewable energy – such as solar or wind farms – is now not only cleaner but sometimes cheaper than fossil fuels. Plans for the mass production of electric vehicles is under way. New forms of food production are also coming online – a positive development to end major emissions from livestock.

Efforts to increase “nature-based solutions” to suck up greenhouse gases have been launched, including mass tree-planting and underwater seaweedforests. Carbon capture technology is improving with some facilities already operating and others soon to open.

But it remains up to politicians around the world to make the transformation to the green economy.

“No more ignoring science. No more ignoring the demands of people everywhere,” said Guterres. “It is time for leaders to stand and deliver, or people in all countries will pay a tragic price.”

Climate change,"China promised climate action. Its emissions topped US, EU, India combined","Taipei, Taiwan –More than any other country, China holds the power to make or break global efforts to prevent a climate catastrophe.

The world’s second-largest economy is the largest polluter globally, although its emissions are comparable to many countries on a per capita basis.

China produces about 30 percent of total emissions – more than the United States, the European Union and India combined, according to Global Carbon Budget 2022.

At the same time, Beijing is eking out a place as a leader in renewable energy, building up more solar power capacity than the entire rest of the world.

But while developed economies are reducing their emissions – albeit too slowly to meet theirParis Agreement pledges– China’s emissions are rising fast due to a furious appetite for coal used to power its cities and energy-intensive industries like steel.

China’s emissions grew by 10 percent year-on-year during the second quarter of this year – putting it on course to beat its previous record of 11.47 billion metric tonnes in 2021, according to data compiled by Carbon Brief, a United Kingdom-based website focused on climate policy.





Left unchecked, the growing carbon footprint threatens to derail international efforts to address the climate crisis, which scientists say already fall far short of what is needed to mitigate the worst outcomes of rising temperatures.

The Chinese economy’s heavy reliance on coal is widely expected to persist for years to come, while climate experts fear that Beijing’s goal of “peak carbon” by 2030, even if achieved, may still be unacceptably high.

Meanwhile, China’s renewable energy targets, though ambitious, face considerable obstacles, including an outdated power grid and the ongoing challenge of storing renewable energy, analysts say.

“No one frankly comes close to China’s leadership in renewables, second place is quite distant,” Cory Combs, associate director of Trivium China, a policy research company, told Al Jazeera.

“On the other hand, China is outpacing the rest of the world on coal as well.”

In 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to reduce his country’s emissions by 65 percent from their 2005 level by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060.

While Xi reiterated those goals in July, the Chinese leader included a caveat: energy policy would be based on the country’s needs and not “swayed by others”.

Driven by concerns about its future energy security, Beijing has in recent years embarked on a building spree of coal-fired power plants.

Chinese authorities approved 86 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired plants in 2022 alone, and green-lit 50GW more in the first six months of 2023, according to Greenpeace.

In total, China currently has 243 GW of new coal-fired power facilities in the pipeline, enough to power Germany, according to a report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and Global Energy Monitor.

“The biggest story right now is probably the energy security perspective. China will not give up coal until it has a guarantee of effective energy security,” Combs said.

“Specifically, we are looking at: one, the ability to provide base-load power at any given time; and two, the ability to guarantee that it can meet any particular peak load.”

Beijing’s decision to double down on coal reflects fears of a repeat of energy crunches that have afflicted the industry in recent years.

In 2021, coal shortages and surging demand for goods from factories during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in blackouts in 20 Chinese cities and provinces. The following summer, a drought sparked by a record-breaking heatwave reduced the capacity of the country’s hydropower dams, which make up 16 percent of China’s power mix.

Faced with back-to-back crises, provinces such as Guangdong began to increase their coal power capacity to ensure they would not face the same issues in the future, said David Fishman, a senior project manager at the Lantau Group, an economic consultancy specialising in Asia-Pacific’s power and gas markets.

“We could draw a pretty clear line there [that] somebody in the economic planning energy office in Guangdong was looking at the same mock-up we did and went, ‘We’re vulnerable to a serious drought in Yunnan, we need to add more backup capacity’,” Fishman told Al Jazeera.

China’s record emissions of recent years may, in fact, underplay the country’s trajectory as carbon-heavy industries like construction and steel experienced serious disruption due to lockdowns in big cities and manufacturing centres.

Nonetheless, some climate experts believe that peak carbon in China is still achievable by 2030 – although the size of the peak could vary considerably depending on political factors.

Boyang Jin, a senior carbon analyst at the UK-based LSEG, said the new coal-fired power plants are meant as a stopgap measure only and provincial governments will still be expected to meet climate targets set by the powerful National Development and Reform Commission.

“With more and more renewable capacity put into operation, coal-fired plants will inevitably decrease their output, or running hours,” Jin told Al Jazeera.

“These plants will be gradually transformed from base load to peak load. Therefore, it’s not at odds with carbon neutrality pledges.”

Still, political risks loom.

China’s slowing economy could encourage Beijing to attempt to build its way to economic growth as it has done in the past, while the powerful steel industry may resist efforts to rein in emissions, analysts say.

“The peak is in sight, it’s achievable, the preconditions are there but there’s a risk for these two reasons that the peak gets delayed until very late in the decade and that could single-handedly derail the global climate effort,” Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst and co-founder of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, told Al Jazeera.

China’s investments in renewables have proceeded at an unprecedented pace.

Beijing topped the list of investors in clean energy in 2022 with $546bn – half of the global total that year, according to BloombergNEF data.

China’s current wind and solar capacity is enough to meet about 30 percent of the country’s energy needs, according to government data.

Translating that investment into reliable energy, however, is not a simple task in practice.

In the case of many wind and solar farms, there is a significant gap between how much power can be generated on paper and how much can be actually used.

China’s National Energy Administration has projected that China’s actual energy generated from renewables will only increase by less than 1 percent per year into 2030.

Much of the gap is due to China’s limited capacity to store and transport power generated from renewable sources to areas of high demand.

While 94 percent of China’s population lives to the east of the “Heihe-Tengchong Line” – an imaginary line dividing the country from northeast to southwest – many hydropower dams and solar power and wind farms are located in sparsely-populated regions in the west.

Other challenges include government intervention in the energy market to keep electricity prices artificially low, encouraging excessive consumption.

Fishman said China’s bid for carbon neutrality will depend on its successful adoption of burgeoning technologies such as carbon capture and green hydrogen over the next few decades.

“The real question is 2060, but obviously it’s far off,” he said. “It relies on a lot of technologies that are far from being mature and scalable and cost-effective.”

Until then, China’s reliance on coal looks set to stay, analysts say.

“Coal is not necessary in principle, but there needs to be a lot more investment and there needs to be a lot of market reform in order to make that practical,” Trivium China’s Combs said.

“And until they’re really in place, it’s coal. And so we get left in the status quo, where you have massive investments in renewables and continued investment in coal.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/8/30/chinas-coal-habit-clouds-climate-fight-as-emissions-top-us-eu-combined

Climate change,Climate change will fuel greater displacement,"For the first time, there is high confidence among scientists that the impacts of climate change are increasingly driving displacement in all regions of the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC)latest report, published on February 28, recognises that climate change is one of several multi-dimensional factors contributing to forced movement today, and that “peace and mobility” are at significant risk from its effects. Without global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and better adapt to the effects of climate change, say the authors, the number of people displaced will grow in the coming decades.

The past several years have been some of the warmest on record, with above-average rainfall, unusually active storm seasons and devastating wildfires. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), whose data and analysis feature in the report, measured 30 million displacements triggered by extreme weather in 2020. In recent weeks, thousands of families have been uprooted as Brazil suffered catastrophic flash flooding and landslides, and Madagascar was hit by four tropical storms in as many weeks. Climate change will make natural events such as these more frequent and more intense in the future.









Some people are able to return home after a short time to recover and rebuild, others remain displaced for months or years, or never return home at all. Two years after Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique, for example, more than 120,000 people are still homeless. While most stay within their countries and don’t cross a border, the impacts of climate change touch every region, so it is a global challenge that must be addressed collectively. The most vulnerable can become trapped in a vicious cycle whereby the effects of climate change erode resilience to withstand natural hazards or environmental stressors, pushing people into displacement, which further amplifies their vulnerability.

Responding to these risks will not only require concerted efforts to reduce emissions and limit global warming, but also sustainable investments in the countries most affected to help prevent and respond to displacement in the face of a changing climate.

Fragile or developing states, which have often contributed the least to global warming, bear the brunt of the impacts of climate change, so it is right that they are financially supported. Industrialised countries must honour their promise to provide $100bn annually to support mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries, a commitment that is yet to materialise. While the costs of displacement are not explicitly accounted for, a fund to cover “loss and damage” failed to garner sufficient support and Scotland was the only nation at last year’s COP26 in Glasgow to pledge anything towards compensation. Greater commitments must be made across the board at the upcoming COP27 in Egypt, and the world will be watching.

With flexible and predictable investment, local, adaptive and sustainable measures can be developed. Urban planning, land reform, resilient infrastructure, disaster defences and early warning systems, for instance, can all help to reduce vulnerability and avoid loss of homes, livelihoods and lives.

Identifying alternative means of making a living that are not reliant on the land could prevent future forced migration but when disasters or climate impacts render a place unsafe or unhabitable, planned relocation or resettlement may be the only suitable options. A 2021reportcommissioned by the Platform on Disaster Displacement found that planned relocation is a global phenomenon occurring in all regions of the world. Multiple hazards and diverse drivers prompt decisions to relocate, according to the report, but around two-thirds of cases surveyed were linked to climate-related hazards.

Given present trends in sea-level rise, the number of communities requiring assisted relocation or resettlement to another country will grow significantly in the years to come. These approaches must include participation from the people at risk and be led by strong local governance. In a world made more isolated by the COVID-19 pandemic, investment in locally owned solutions will be more important than ever.

The world is waking up to the threat of climate change for the planet but the challenges of human mobility in this context require far greater global attention if years of hard-won development progress are not to be lost. To build a strong case, we need a strong evidence base. IDMC, for our part, will continue to monitor the phenomenon and highlight best practices around the world. I also use this opportunity to call for a dedicated IPCC report on the link between climate change, forced migration and displacement. A scientific investigation into how climate change interacts with other social, economic and political factors to influence human mobility is necessary to lay the foundations of effective action and sustainable investment.

Solutions exist but more reliable and robust data is needed to focus our actions. The number of people forced to flee, their conditions, needs and aspirations, the duration and severity of their displacement and the risk of future forced movement must all be better quantified so that governments and the international community can plan and respond accordingly.

As we look ahead to COP27 later in the year, when leaders will be given a final chance to act before it’s too late, we hope that this report inspires urgent, renewed commitment. As the authors conclude: “The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and the health of the planet. Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.”

Climate change,"Scientists say Oman, UAE deluge ‘most likely’ linked to climate change","Global warming caused by fossil fuel emissions “most likely” exacerbated the intense rains that lashed theUAEandOmanlast week, causing deaths and widespread flooding, an expert group of scientists has found.

The World Weather Attribution (WWA), an international group of scientists that investigates extreme weather events, said climate change caused by fossil fuel emissions is the probable reason but cannot be pinpointed “with certainty”.

The study compiled by 21 international researchers found extreme rainfall in El Nino years has become 10-40 percent heavier in the region affected.

“Warming, caused by burning fossil fuels, is the most likely explanation for the increasing rainfall,” WWA said in the study published on Thursday.

“There are no other known explanations” for the sharp rise in precipitation, the group added.

Twenty-one people died in Oman and four in the United Arab Emirates, which was battered by the heaviest rainfall since records began for the desert Gulf state 75 years ago.

The oil-producing states have been experiencing extreme heat brought on by global warming. But last week’s floods revealed the additional risk of exceptional weather events as the planet heats up.

“The UAE and Oman floods have shown that even dry regions can be strongly affected by precipitation events, a threat that is increasing with increasing global warming due to fossil fuel burning,” said Sonia Seneviratne, a WWA member and professor at Zurich’s ETH university.

The WWA study analysed historic weather data and climate models to determine changes in rainfall patterns in the area, including in the years affected by El Nino, a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.

It found extreme rains were significantly less intense in the years before 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2F) of warming above pre-industrial levels.

“Extreme rainfall events have become at least 10 percent heavier in the UAE and Oman,” said Mariam Zachariah, a WWA member and researcher at London’s Imperial College.

“This finding … agrees with the basic physics that a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture.”

The storm first landed in Oman on April 14, killing at least 21 people in flash floods and other incidents, according to the official Oman News Agency.

It hit the UAE on April 16, dumping nearly two years’ worth of rain that flooded homes, roads, malls and offices and left four people dead.

Dubai faced severe disruption for days with major roads blocked by floods, power outages and some residents trapped in their homes. Dubai Airport, the world’s busiest by international travellers, cancelled 2,155 flights, diverted 115 and did not return to full capacity until Tuesday.

“The situation was unprecedented in its severity but we are a country that learns from every experience,” Dubai ruler and UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said on Wednesday, announcing a $544m package to repair homes.

Friederike Otto, a climatologist and WWA member, said the world agreed at COP28 in Dubai to “transition away” from fossil fuels, but nearly half a year later countries are still opening new oil and gas fields.

“If the world keeps burning fossil fuels, rainfall in many regions of the world will get heavier and heavier, resulting in deadlier and more destructive floods,” Otto said.

Climate change,‘Reaching end game’: New paper on climate change raises alarm,"A climate change paper grabbed headlines this week with its terrifying prediction of what the world will be in 30 years’ time – absent drastic and immediate change to human societies.

“World of outright chaos,” “Climate apocalypse,” “We’re all gonna die,” the media banners blared.









The sobering headlines and equally disconcerting stories beneath described a “scenario analysis” by an Australian think-tank, Breakthrough National Center for Climate Restoration.

The paper portrayed what the year 2050 will look like if urgent action to build carbon-neutral energy systems around the world fails to come to fruition in the next 10 years.

It’s worse than any of the apocalyptic Hollywood horror films making the rounds.

One billion people displaced and fighting desperately for survival, with half the world’s population subjected to “lethal heat” conditions for more than 20 days a year – “beyond the threshold of human survivability”.

Drought, wildfires, and floods collapse entire ecosystems as two billion people struggle for potable water. Mega-cities such as Mumbai, Hong Kong, Lagos, and Manila are largely abandoned because of massive floods.









“This scenario provides a glimpse into a world of ‘outright chaos’ on a path to the end of human civilisation and modern society as we have known it,” said the paper, co-authored by Ian Dunlop, a former chair of the Australian Coal Association, and David Spratt, a long-time climate researcher.

Spratt told Al Jazeera the eye-catching headlines were “somewhat over the top”, but he maintained the dire warnings were legitimate.

“We are reaching the end game, there are not a lot of pieces left on the chess board. We have to take action really fast,” said Spratt.

He challenged climate scientists, including those from the leading Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to be more forthright with the global public about the calamity awaiting humanity if nothing is immediately done to halt the pumping of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the Earth’s atmosphere.

The planet is currently on track for a 4.5 degree Celsius increase in global temperature as CO2 emissions continue to rise each year.

Dunlop noted the IPCC set a target of staying below a 1.5C increase in the coming decades. “This IPCC analysis assumes only a 50-66 percent chance of meeting the targets. Not good odds for the future of humanity,” hewrotethis week.

Asked about the criticism, IPCC’s Nina Peeva responded: “We can’t comment on individual papers on climate science. Our job is to inform policymakers about the current state of knowledge on climate change… If this paper was published in a peer-reviewed journal, it will probably be considered in the next assessment appearing in 2021.”

Congressional testimony from two US government intelligence analysts on Wednesday seemed to corroborate Breakthrough’s grim climate change analysis.

Peter Kiemel, from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, told a House committee investigating the global effects of climate change on national security that it played a role in the bloody civil wars in Syria and Libya, and will do the same in the future.

Just prior to the outbreak of Syria’s devastating war in 2011, the region suffered one of the most severe droughts in its history, quadrupling rural-to-urban migration and causing food riots.

Climate change impacts on food and water systems were also “catalysts for social breakdown and conflict” in the Maghreb and the Sahel, contributing to the European migration crisis, Breakthrough’s paper said.

“We already have seen water crises exacerbate social unrest in and emigration from fragile states in the Middle East and North Africa,”saidKiemel.

“As the climate changes, disputes over water and access to arable land are likely to grow, prompting more such local conflicts.”

Rod Schoonover, a senior State Department analyst, told members of the House Intelligence Committee no nation would be immune from the ravages of climate change.

“Most countries, if not all, are already unable to fully respond to the risks posed by climate-linked hazards under the present conditions,”saidSchoonover.

“Absent extensive mitigating factors or events, we see few plausible future scenarios where significant harm does not arise from the compounded effects of climate change.”

The Washington Postreportedon Friday that Trump administration officials ordered the words “possibly catastrophic” erased from Schoonover’s written statement.

What can’t be deleted is a 2007 climate change security report titled The Age of Consequences, co-authored by former CIA director James Woolsey. Its wording leaves no doubt about the threat to the human species.

“Armed conflict between nations over resources, such as the Nile and its tributaries, is likely and nuclear war is possible. The social consequences range from increased religious fervour to outright chaos,”the studywarned.

While the immense challenge of abruptly ending fossil fuel use seems extremely daunting, there are reasons for hope.

Spratt and others noted the technology to shift away from fossil fuels to clean energy is already in place, and more could be done if government budgets were allocated towards decarbonisation.

“We have the technological and economic capacity. If we would have made the shift in 2009, we would be all right today,” said Spratt.

Climate watchers say what is desperately needed is political leadership worldwide to rein in C02-burning corporations and shift the global economic system to green technology.

Jonathan Patz, director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,toldUSA Today the technology for a carbon-free economic system is already in place.

“We’re not waiting for solutions. We’re simply waiting for political will to understand that the solutions are here. Clean energy is not a matter of waiting, it’s a matter of implementing,” said Patz.

But with US President Donald Trump, who denies human-induced climate change and oversees the world’s largest economy, there is ample reason for serious concern.

The winds of change are blowing, however, as climate changeprotest movementssprout up worldwide.

In the US, the world’s second largest CO2 emitter after China, presidential candidate Joe Biden announced a $5 trillion climate proposal on Tuesday as part of his campaign for 2020. The same day, Hollywood actor Robert Downey Jr said he would launch a new hi-tech venture called the Footprint Coalition to combat climate change.









On Thursday, US billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said he would spend $500m in the “fight of our time” to move the US away from carbon energy.

Breakthrough’s paper stated “a massive global mobilisation” of resources was needed in the next decade to build a zero-emissions industrial system.

So can humanity save itself with the clock ticking down fast?

Admiral Chris Barrie – the former chief of Australia’s defence forces who wrote the foreword to Breakthrough’s paper – said human societies must act collectively to survive.

Climate change,The case for collaborating on climate change,"Last month the UK Prime Minister Theresa May reminded senior Republicans in Philadelphia of the power and importance of the relationship between Britain and the United States.

She argued that together we have won world wars and built the key global institutions on which the world relies: the United Nations, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, all sharing a genesis in our cooperation, each reflecting our shared values.









Some of these institutions are currently under question in both our nations and perhaps require a “tune up”. Yet, that need not undermine May’s fundamental appeal for the US to stand with other world nations in addressing key challenges.

She said: “Because we know that so many of the threats we face today – global terrorism, climate change, and unprecedented movements of people – do not respect national borders. So we must turn towards those multinational institutions like the UN and NATO that encourage international cooperation and partnership.”







The Paris Agreement created the framework for the shared global responsibility of arresting climate change.

It is not hyperbole to state that responding to climate change, as agreed in Paris, now sits at the heart of the relationship between the US, Britain and Europe.

Having served under Prime Minister David Cameron as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, I have no doubt how fundamentally committed to climate action both Britain and the broader European community are.

In Britain the debate is over: tackling climate change has strong cross-party support.Senior ministers such as the Chancellor Philip Hammond, and the Business Secretary Greg Clark, get climate and if anything are sending even stronger messages of commitment to act on climate than the Cameron/Osborne Conservative majority government before.

I also had the privilege to work closely with the other 27 member states of the European Union, as we unanimously agreed on the 2030 legislative package to address climate change which outlines the ambitious commitments and strategy shared by European states.

Any withdrawal by the US from the Paris Agreement and its shared responsibilities will be viewed poorly across the capitals of Berlin, Paris, Warsaw and London. It will be seen as a negation of the leadership we expect from our ally across the Atlantic.

The meeting of the G20 this week in Germany provides a perfect opportunity for countries to stand together in the face of worsening crises and bolster prevention of future shocks. Climate change sits high in this agenda.

We look to the United States to join us, as they have over the last century, to lead the global community on the complex crises facing us all.

by

Working together to respond to climate change is in all of our national interests.

Providing support to developing nations dealing with the impacts of climate change protects us from the inevitable increased military and security threats created by instability caused by resource scarcity.

Having sat on the UK National Security Council, I know that climate change was treated as a key military risk at the highest levels of the UK government.

OPINION: Science doesn’t care if you believe in it or not

And by acting to help countries manage changes in the climate, we can help stem the unprecedented movement of people across the globe.

It is many of these knock-on effects of global challenges that President Donald Trump has so powerfully identified as concerning his people. But to solve these knock-on effects, it is key to recognise that issues like climate change are the cause.

Climate change stands at the centre of the world’s shared interests in managing instability. Rich countries must recognise their own self-interest in helping support the developing world with climate mitigation, if only because it manages risks closer to home.

Surely President Trump does not want to bear the costs of building a wall along the entire West Coast to keep the people of the Pacific from scrambling to higher ground?

We look to the US to join us, as they have over the last century, to lead the global community on the complex crises facing us all.

OPINION: Canada was first to try to muzzle scientists and fail

International collaboration and holistic responses are our best way forward. Inappropriate isolationism will serve no one. President Trump and his administration have not clarified how they will manage major international treaties and alliances, but their distrust of internationalism is clear.

Yet, such scepticism need not end in opposition. Challenging institutions need not mean rejection. Questioning how an agreement is implemented need not mean withdrawal.

So, when it comes to the Paris Agreement, the White House should reflect on how the US military have long regarded climate change – as a key threat multiplier: by reducing its impacts through the Paris Agreement, we can prevent conflict and the pressures behind mass movement of peoples.

Climate change,People’s Climate Vote: Majority sees climate change as emergency,"The largest global survey on climate change ever conducted has found that 64 percent of people believe that it is an “emergency” and must be addressed urgently, but just 10 percent believe world leaders are doing enough.

The People’s Climate Vote surveyed 1.2 million people in 50 countries using ads in 17 prominent mobile gaming apps. Respondents represent 56 percent of the world’s people over the age of 14, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which worked with pollsters at the University of Oxford to conduct the survey. The results were published on Wednesday.

“There is a groundswell of people that are saying even during a pandemic that climate change is an emergency and here’s how we want to solve it,” Cassie Flynn, UNDP’s strategic adviser on climate change and head of its Climate Promise initiative, told Al Jazeera.

Flynn said she came up with the idea of reaching people through mobile gaming apps such as Words With Friends and Angry Birds while on a train in New York City.

“I was on the subway and every single person was on their phone playing a game, and I asked myself, ‘What is the best way to connect these people with those making important decisions that will affect our lives for generations to come?’” Flynn said.

Flynn said she learned the gaming industry has access to 2.7 billion people worldwide, more than the movie and music industries combined.

So she and her fellow researchers leveraged that access by designing ads for their survey in 17 languages that people could complete on their phones, resulting in “a huge, unique, and random sample of people of all genders, ages, and educational backgrounds”, survey authors wrote.

The survey found that in every country, younger people felt more strongly that climate change is an emergency than older people, with 69 percent of those under the age of 18 saying so. But about two-thirds of those aged 18 to 59 also recognise it as an emergency, as well as 58 percent of those over the age of 60.

Of categories of countries surveyed, the highest level of support (74 percent) for urgent climate action came from small island developing states, followed by high-income countries (72 percent), middle-income countries (62 percent), and least developed countries (58 percent).

Respondents were also asked to rank policy to address climate change by importance. Conserving forests and land came in at the top (54 percent), followed by the need for more solar, wind and renewable power (53 percent), adopting climate-friendly farming techniques (52 percent) and investing more in green businesses and jobs (50 percent).

“People want their voices heard even though right now, they are scared and there is so much instability. They still have ideas about how we can get out of this crisis. Politicians and world leaders need to listen,” Flynn said.

Of the people who believe that climate change is an emergency, 59 percent said that the world should do everything possible to respond to the crisis while 20 percent said the world should act slowly. Just 10 percent said world leaders are already doing enough to address climate change.

The data also reveals a direct link between a person’s level of education and calls for climate action. People with post-secondary education are more likely to say climate change is deserving of immediate action whether they are in low-income countries such as Bhutan (82 percent) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (82 percent) – or wealthy countries like France (87 percent) and Japan (82 percent).

Governments around the world have been overwhelmed with the burgeoning coronavirus pandemic as well as a global economic crisis. Resources that may have ordinarily gone to fighting climate change and creating sustainable policies are instead being allocated to halting the spread of the virus and propping up struggling sectors.

But Flynn told Al Jazeera that addressing the COVID-19 crisis and climate change can go hand in hand.

“This is a moment that we need that ambition,” she said. “Governments are facing extraordinary decisions that will affect generations to come, whether in dealing with COVID-19 or climate. The decisions about our future are being locked in now.”

Dealing with COVID-19 is similar to dealing with the climate crisis, Flynn added, because both require building a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future for everyone.

Boosting economies in the post-COVID era may also mean governments look at opportunities through a multi-pronged lens. Investing in renewable energy, for example, can create much-needed employment for citizens and it can also provide clean energy sources for entire communities.

“We can do something that would open up opportunity and not only recover from COVID but also address the climate issue,” Flynn said. “People must have enough credibility to have a virtual seat at the table in rooms where decisions are being made.”

Researchers hope the findings of the UNDP survey will help inform countries as they work to develop their national climate pledges, which are also known as nationally determined contributions and are part of nations’ commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/1/27/64-of-people-surveyed-say-climate-change-calls-for-urgent-action
Climate change,"US Senate approves bill to fight climate change, cut drug costs","Democrats in the United States have passed a sweeping $430bn bill intended to fight climate change, lower drug prices and raise some corporate taxes, in a major victory for President Joe Biden.

The package, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, passed the Senate on Sunday by a 51-50 party line vote with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking ballot.

“The Senate is making history,” an elated Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, after pumping his fists in the air as Democrats cheered and their staff members responded to the vote with a standing ovation.

“To Americans who’ve lost faith that Congress can do big things, this bill is for you,” he said. “This bill is going to change America for decades.”

Schumer said the legislation contains “the boldest clean energy package in American history” to fight climate change while reducing consumer costs for energy and some medicines.

The action sends the measure to the House of Representatives for a vote, likely Friday when representatives plan to reconvene briefly during a summer recess. They are expected to pass it, which would then send the bill to the White House for Biden’s signature. In a statement, Biden said he looked forward to signing the bill into law.

Democrats hope the bill’s passage will help the party’s House and Senate candidates in the November 8 midterm elections at a time when Biden is suffering from anemic public approval ratings amid high inflation.

Senators engaged in a round-the-clock marathon of voting that began Saturday and stretched late into Sunday. Democrats swatted down some three dozen Republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation.

Conservative lawmakers have criticised the bill as wasteful spending, with top Republican Senator Mitch McConnell accusing Democrats of voting to “double down on their economic disaster”.

The legislation is aimed at reducing carbon emissions and shifting consumers to green energy, while cutting prescription drug costs for the elderly and tightening enforcement on taxes for corporations and the wealthy.

The bill would invest nearly $375bn over the decade in climate change-fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles.

It’s broken down to include $60bn for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and $30bn for a production tax credit for wind and solar, seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. The bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as Exxon Mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance.

For consumers, there are tax breaks as incentives to go green. One is a 10-year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar. There are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles, including a $4,000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and $7,500 for new ones.

In all, Democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2030, and “would represent the single biggest climate investment in US history, by far”.

“This is a historic achievement,” said Gregory Wetsone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy.

“This represents the first time in the United States that we have seen Congress take a serious effort to deal with the climate problem. And this bill, the programmes it includes, are ones we have been advocating for many years and I think will have a huge impact allowing the clean energy transition that we know we are going to need to deal with climate change,” he told Al Jazeera.

On the healthcare front, the bill would allow the Medicare programme to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies for the first time, saving the federal government some $288bn over the 10-year budget window.

Those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications, including a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies. It also extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance.

The bill’s final costs were being recalculated, but overall it would raise more than $700bn over a decade. The money would come from a 15 percent minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above $1bn, a 1 percent tax on companies that repurchase their own stock, bolstered IRS tax collections, and government savings from lower drug costs.

With some $740bn in new revenue and around $440bn in new investments, the bill promises to put the difference of about $300bn toward deficit reduction.

The latest package is barely more than one-tenth the size of Biden’s initial 10-year, $3.5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations in his Build Back Better initiative. It abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool, paid family leave, and expanded child care aid. That plan collapsed after conservative Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, opposed it saying it was too costly and would drive inflation.

Nonpartisan analysts have said the Inflation Reduction Act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices.

Republicans said the bill would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummetinginto recession. They said the bill’s business taxes would hurtjob creationand force prices skyward, making it harder for people to cope with the nation’s worstinflationsince the 1980s.

“Democrats have already robbed American families once through inflation, and now their solution is to rob American families a second time,” McConnell, the Senate Minority leader, argued.

He said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having an insignificant effect on inflation and climate change.

Climate change,Modern slavery: Pakistan’s latest climate change curse,"This spring, I spent time with farming families across rural Sindh and the Kacchi Plains of Balochistan, the two worst-hit regions by last summer’s super floods that submergeda third of Pakistan, displaced eight million people, and saw millions more lose their livelihoods.

Six months after the monsoons, I saw field after field still under water. Elsewhere, the soil was too damaged for sowing seeds. Yet, the small and landless tenant farmers I spoke with, facing another lost crop cycle, were as concerned about being stripped of their liberty as about displacement and hunger.









Pakistan has introduced measures against modern slavery with mixed success. Climate change, however, is reinforcing the most egregious abuses due to mounting personal debt, and the economic relationship between sharecroppers and small farmers on the one hand, and landlords and local merchants on the other.

While sharecropping has declined significantly in Pakistan’s largest and wealthiest province, Punjab, it continues in more rural Sindh and Balochistan. Tenant farmers borrow to cover the expenses of a crop cycle. Since loans from microfinance banks require collateral and identity documentation, farmers prefer less formal arrangements with a landlord or local moneylender.

Landlords and sharecroppers split the costs of cropping, with the former providing credit for seeds, fertiliser, and other inputs. The farmer repays the landlord out of the profits from the yield. If the income is insufficient, the debt is rolled over to the following harvest. Successive years of crop failure create interminable cycles of debt, which are transferred from generation to generation: Many sharecroppers are still paying off their ancestors’ loans.

Powerful landlords even detain their indebted farmers in private prisons until they repay through unpaid labour, only occasionally resulting in police action. By some estimates,more than three million Pakistanisare trapped in debt bondage.

Small farmers, meanwhile, risk losing their land to local merchants and moneylenders, who charge interest rates as high as 40 percent for loans. The high interest means that “if the crop fails even once, you are in a debt trap”, one activist and academic in the Kacchi Plains told me.

The terms of the loan require that the farmer’s harvest be sold exclusively to the moneylender. Should the yield not cover the loan’s value, the lender often summons an informal council, overseen by tribal or local elites, to call for an ownership transfer of the debtor’s land.

“Heat waves and floods are a major opportunity for the merchant,” the activist-academic said. “This is when he can acquire land at the cheapest rate.”

The 2022 floods destroyed several crop cycles well into 2023, compounding farmers’ debts to predatory lenders, and dispossessing many of their land. Several farmers I spoke to had unsuccessfully lobbied landlords to reduce their dues. Based on court case filings, local activists and rights organisations say that the 2022 floods have pushed many more people into bonded labour – despite national and provincial laws against the practice.This summer’s monsoons, during which over 100 people died in weather-related incidents, will only compound the crisis.

Women farmers are especially vulnerable. According to a 2018 UN Women report, 60 percent of women’s agriculture work is unpaid.  Women do most of the cotton picking in the country – Pakistan is the world’s fourth-largest cotton producer – and a lucrative textile industry benefits from their labour in unsafe conditions and for “slave wages”, as a local lawyer and activist who campaigns for cotton farmers’ rights in Sindh described it to me. The 2022 floods destroyed Sindh’s cotton belt, eliminating even this meagre income and making it still harder for those women to repay their debts.

Floods aren’t the only problem: During heat waves, some Sindh and Balochistan districts see temperatures hover near 50 degrees Celsius, decimating the cotton crop. In Jacobabad, one of the world’s hottest cities and part of Pakistan’s rice belt, delays in rain have shifted the time of rice cultivation from May until August. This is preventing the rice from ripening in the summer and severely eroding its quality.

Sindh’s southeastern Thar region, near the Indian border and predominantly Hindu, saw a massive drought between 2015 and 2018, forcing farmers into protracted seasonal migration, during which they tilled big landlords’ lands. Most were from underprivileged castes and, as a victimised demographic within an already marginalised minority community, particularly vulnerable to exploitation.

In 2019, I co-authoreda study supported by the United Kingdom government, which found that when migrant farmers tried returning home to Thar after the drought ended, landlords prevented them – on the pretext that they owed several years’ worth of rent, which had to be recouped through unpaid labour.

Prolonged drought thus created a new generation of bonded labourers in one of the most neglected parts of the province, even spawning awave of suicidessince the drought began – mostly among young, underprivileged caste women. And this worrying trend is not unique to Pakistan: An agrarian crisis inIndia’s western Maharashtra statehas driven tens of thousands of women, burdened with debt, to suicide in recent years.

Urban migration offers an escape to some. Last year’s floods prompted many Thari migrants to move to Pakistan’s megacity, Karachi, where a large number still reside under bridges and in construction sites. Many told me they favour these conditions over debt bondage, unpaid labour, and other abuses at the hands of landlords. Others are willing to risk the cruelties of illegal migration.

At COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh last November, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made a poignant case fordebt relief and compensationfor a nation that, while facing a major external debt crisis, was just starting its long recovery from one of the most catastrophic floods in recent memory. No doubt this informed the creation by the end of the conference of a climate loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries, the result of an admirable political mobilisation in the Global South around climate justice. But if greater access to climate financing is to address the full costs of global warming in Pakistan, the politics around climate action at home has to be more inclusive, too.

It will require significant political will for the state to act against large landlords in Sindh and Balochistan, many of whom are either elected to provincial assemblies or are otherwise important local powerbrokers. Everywhere I went in Sindh and Balochistan, communities were bristling with anger and ready to speak out. They need support from the press, activists, the legal community and civil society at large to turn that anger into public pressure on the government to apply laws against bonded labour, people trafficking and certain types of debt.

Several stakeholders have argued that Pakistan, which just received a long-delayed International Monetary Fund bailout, is a good candidate for debt relief or debt restructuring as a form of reparation from the Global North to nations in the Global South most affected by global warming.

But there is a much darker connection between climate and debt in the most disaster-prone parts of the country. And it’s a modern slavery issue that demands our immediate attention.

Climate change,Australian election: Where is climate change on the agenda?,"Canberra, Australia– As southern Australia continues to recover from the destruction of the 2019-2020 ‘Black Summer’ bushfires, towns in Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) have just experienced devastating floods.

Some towns have even seen ‘once in 100 year’ floods occur twice in several weeks. In Lismore, an NSW town of nearly 30,000 people, the river rose more than 14 metres in late February, breaching the town’s levees and inundating people’s homes and businesses. Thousands of residents were forced to take refuge on their roofs.

Lismore flooded again in March. More than 2,000 homes are now considereduninhabitable.

While Lismore has flooded five times in the past 60 years, this year’s floods were 2 metres above the previous historic high. Across NSW and Queensland, 22 people died.

As with the Black Summer bushfires, the federal government has been criticised for being too slow to respond. Locals relied on their own communities to provide crucial assistance in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and Lismore residents later took their flood-damaged belongings to Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s official residence, dumping ruined armchairs and soft toys at his gate. Some held placards that read ‘Your climate inaction killed my neighbour’.

The cost of the floods is expected to exceed 2 billion Australian dollars ($1.44 bn), making it one of the country’s most costly natural disasters ever.

“Despite decades of warnings from scientists about climate change, Australia is unprepared for the supercharged weather that it is now driving,” said Hilary Bambrick, co-author of Australia’s annual assessment of progress on climate adaptation.

“Australia is at the forefront of severe climate change … Climate change means that Australia’s extreme weather – heat, drought, bushfires and floods – will continue to get much, much worse if we don’t act now.”

Despite this and voters’ desire for action, climate change has barely been a talking point in campaigning for the country’s federal election, which will take place in less than a week on May 21.

“Australians are hyper concerned about climate change,” University of Tasmania political scientist Kate Crowley told Al Jazeera. ”But the major parties, especially the [ruling] Coalition, don’t want to talk about climate change. For them, it’s done and dusted.

“The Coalition has a ‘never never’ target and no immediate plans to do anything, except ensure fossil fuels are in the mix.”

Most politicians in Scott Morrison’s Liberal-National Coalition are climate change sceptics, if not outright deniers, as well as being economically and socially conservative.

Climate writer Ketan Joshi has been tracking politicians’ social media mentions of climate change.

He found that just four percent of tweets from senators and three percent of tweets from members of parliament mentioned climate in the first week of the campaign. Most did not tweet about climate change at all.

“Tweets are a proxy for discourse,” Joshi explained. “It’s a really simple read on [the issue’s] prominence, and it turns out that even when climate is mentioned in bad faith, it’s still only a tiny, tiny proportion of the discussion.”

Joshi believes there are two main reasons for the lack of discussion around climate change.

“One is that the issue isn’t prominent enough, considering its physical urgency,” he said. “The second is that when it is discussed, it’s always on the back of something going wrong, as opposed to an initiated effort to talk about a really important issue.”



Since I’m storing tweets anyway, I thought I’d create an auto-generating weekly summary of how politicians and the press gallery are mentioning climate, fossils and clean tech.

Here’s the first week. More features to come in the next report, but for now……you get the picturepic.twitter.com/1baUB5u9BC

The only moment when climate change has emerged as a serious point of discussion in recent weeks was when Queensland Nationals Senator Matt Canavan – claiming decisions on climate change could be left for 10 or 20 years time – declared net zero to be “dead” and “all over bar the shouting”.

“Canavan actually put climate on the agenda,” explained Crowley. “The Coalition were quite happy to ignore questions [on it] and just repeat policies … After all, they’ve got a target without really having a target.”

Poll after poll has found that the majority of Australians want to see the government take serious action on combating climate change.

National broadcaster ABC runs Vote Compass, the country’s largest survey of voter attitudes. In this year’s poll, 29 percent of those surveyed ranked climate change as the issue most important to them. This was higher than any other single issue, even in the face of the increasing cost of living, which 13 percent rated as the biggest issue.

In mid-2021, a YouGov poll conducted for the Australian Conservation Foundation found that climate change was an important issue for 67 percent of voters, including 28 percent who said it was the single most important issue in determining who they would vote for.

Crucially, a majority of voters in all 151 of Australia’s federal electorates believe that the government of Scott Morrison should have been doing more to tackle climate change. Even in key coal regions such as the Hunter Valley, voters did not believe new coal and gas plants should be built.

Polls have also found that young Australians are especially concerned about climate change. A 2021 survey from the Foundations For Tomorrow initiative found that 93 percent of Australians under 30 think the government is doing too little to tackle climate change.

Some 88 percent of Australians aged 18 to 24 are enrolled to vote, and voting is compulsory in Australia.

Many voters say they feel that there is little substantial difference between the Coalition and the Labor Party, who are currently in opposition, especially on climate change.

The Coalition has set a target to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2030, based on 2005 levels. To do so, they say they will not move away fromheavy polluters such as coal and gasbut instead rely on carbon capture and storage, alongside new low emission technologies. The exact technologies have not been specified, mostly because they do not yet exist.

The Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese, holds a 43 percent emissions reduction target by 2030, still below the expert-recommended target of 50 to 75 percent. If elected in May, Labor plans to invest heavily in renewables, creating more than 600,000 jobs in the process. Labor also has detailed strategies for supporting workers’ transition from fossil fuels to other sectors.

The Coalition and Labor agree that net zero should be achieved by 2050, yet both receive significant donations from the mining industry, more than any other sector. As with the Liberal Party, Labor will not sign the UN pledge to end coal fire power if elected.

Despite several high-profile commitments from energy producers such as AGL to shut down coal and gas plants earlier than previously planned, both major political parties have committed to continuing to support fossil fuels.

There are 114 new coal and gas projects on the government’s official register, such as the controversial gas extraction project in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin. Altogether, these projects would increase Australia’s emissions by more than 250 percent.

Despite the public concern, the Australian fossil fuels lobby has proved remarkably strong, claiming that mining props up the Australian economy – it contributes about 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and employs 261,000 people – and that without it, financial disaster looms.

The lobby has also used class rhetoric to place coal mining as a central element of regional working-class politics, encouraging both major parties to see being pro-fossil fuels as a vote winner.

The Greens – a left-wing environmental party often referred to as Australia’s ‘third party’ – are the only group to have argued the need for Australia to do more on climate. It has set a lofty 75 percent target for emissions reductions by 2030 and wants to see net zero achieved by 2035 or earlier, primarily through ending the mining, burning, and export of thermal coal by 2030.

The Greens’ campaign material describes net zero by 2050 as “a death sentence”. The party is now calling for a moratorium on new coal, gas, and oil projects.

“The mining and burning of coal and gas are the leading causes of the climate crisis,” said the Greens’ Adam Bandt of the demand.

“Keeping coal and gas in the ground is the very first thing a government would do if they were serious about treating global heating like the climate emergency that it is.”

One big question remains, however.

Just how much will voters actually put their climate concerns first when it comes to election day?

At the polling station, local issues can sometimes seem much more urgent.

Inflation is at itshighest in 20 years, with the price of everyday items like vegetables, meat, and petrol all increasing thanks to the war in Ukraine as well as the floods earlier this year.

Skyrocketing house prices and rents are also at the forefront of many people’s minds, as are key issues that were highlighted during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as aged care. And the central bank has justhiked interest ratesfor the first time since 2010.

“People have very much separated climate and politics,” agreed Joshi. “Someone can see climate change as an important issue, but still have a [negative] gut reaction to supporting the Greens.

“It’s worth noting that people will often express strong support for climate action in surveys, but have very confused and mixed views when it comes to its immediacy.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/17/australian-election-where-is-climate-change-on-the-agenda
Climate change,Extreme heat is the silent assassin of climate change,"Twenty million people dead in a heatwave, some poached alive in a lake they hoped to cool off in.

It is, for now, science fiction.









Kim Stanley Robinson’s apocalyptic novel, Ministry for the Future, starts in an Indian town where many have not survived a summer night. By day, the survivors are choked with the fumes of generators powering air conditioners. The air is “like breathing through the exhaust pipe of an old bus”, he writes.

We’re not there, yet. But extreme heat, far less visually dramatic than hurricanes or floods, is claiming lives and livelihoods with a stealth that belies its impact. Climate change is dramatically increasing the probability that we will see a mass fatality extreme heat disaster soon.

Extreme heat is not only an issue in the Northern Hemisphere from June to September. As I write, in March, there’s an unprecedented closure of schools across South Sudan. It’s due not to conflict or economic woes but an extraordinary surge in temperatures to more than 42 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit). Parts ofSouth Americaand Australia are just emerging from their two hottest summers ever. Worldwide, 2023 was the hottest on record –by a huge margin. Half the world’s people – 3.8 billion in fact – simmered under extreme heat for at least one day last year.

Heatwavesacross Europekilled more than 60,000 people in 2022. In theUnited Kingdom, roads melted and almost 3,000 people died.Indiasees at least 1,000 deaths a year attributable to extreme heat. In the United States, the number is similar. Extreme heat there kills more people than floods and tornadoes combined. According to The Lancet medical journal,Chinais on track to see from 20,000 to 80,000 heatwave deaths a year.

And all these figures are, in fact, probablygross underestimates. Unlike deaths in floods, most of those during heatwaves are recorded as something medical. Extreme heat is the silent assassin of climate change.

It’s to expose this and propose solutions that the inauguralGlobal Summit on Extreme Heatis convening this week. Jointly hosted by my organisation, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and by the US Agency for International Development, the online forum will bring together thinkers and doers. Because there’s a lot to think about. And even more to do.

Climate change, of course, exacerbates extreme heat. World Weather Attribution reports like a recent one about heat insouthern West Africashow – near unequivocally – that heatwaves are much more frequent and hotter because of a generally warmer world. This underscores the need to mitigate emissions. But no amount of action now will stop heatwaves in our lifetimes. What we can do is cope better when they hit by preparing before they do.

How?

First, by focusing on the most vulnerable. Heatwaves have a disproportionate impact on those in cities, where heat is often trapped, and on those without the means to escape either literally or into air-conditioned cocoons. Cities need plans. City planners increasingly recognise this. Two-thirds of those who responded to asurvey by The Lancetsaid they were concerned about climate change impacting public health. Extreme heat was the most frequently identified hazard, named by 72 percent of respondents. Heat action plans identify vulnerable groups and “heat island” or “hot spot” areas. They identify triggers for action and warnings and assign clear roles and responsibilities. They test innovative but simple solutions like shades over crowded outdoor areas such as markets and tree planting within informal settlements. Freetown in Sierra Leone recentlylaunched its plan. I’m delighted Freetown’s mayor will be speaking at the summit.

Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies oftenhelpwith such plans. Kenya’s Red Cross, for example, has worked with scientists, researchers, city authorities and community leaders to map out areas of highest heat risk in Nairobi’s informal settlements. Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have done similar studies in Cape Town, Hanoi, Mexico City and Dhaka.

Second, by prioritising early warnings and early actions. Turning science and forecasts into accessible information saves lives. People warned in advance make better decisions and take better actions. That can be through media but also through telephone calls to people registered as vulnerable months ahead of time – Australia’sTelecross REDis one example. Anticipatory action – moving those who can move, for example, or putting temporary cooling infrastructure in place – also saves lives. In Hanoi, before a recent heatwave, volunteers with Vietnam’s Red Cross positioned mobile cooling centres near areas where street vendors and motorcycle riders gathered. Spain rosters more lifeguards on beaches on days projected to be the hottest, knowing that it’s on them that the least experienced swimmers venture into the sea.

Third, by putting power in the hands of those on the ground. Local people know their communities best. Fellow residents trust them. Skills and resources can be shared quickly and efficiently. Fatema Khatun and Sayma Khatun Bithi are two of many Red Crescent volunteers in Bangladesh whoteach first-aid skills, including how to help someone who falls unconscious due to overheating.

Above all, though, addressing extreme heat starts with highlighting the problem. At this week’s global summit, we’ll be announcing a two-month campaign of action on extreme heat ahead ofHeat Action Dayitself on June 2. We’ll be launching an online toolkit to help guide people with what they can do to spread knowledge and prepare for the Northern Hemisphere’s summer, which for many has already begun.

Science fiction is deliberately scary. Reality need not be. With the right anticipation and action, the worst scenarios can remain in the realm of the imagination.

Climate change,Jordan’s Bedouins take on the struggles of climate change,"Wadi Rum, Jordan –The sprawling desert valley has for centuries been home to nomadic people who traditionally made a living herding goats, sheep and camels, as well as hunting.

But with climate change affecting their livelihood, the Bedouins here in the southern part of the country have had to develop the area as a tourist site.

Salaha al-Zalabeih, 89, has been living in Wadi Rum all her life and has seen the area change before her eyes. The UNESCO World Heritage site has become renowned for being one of the country’s most popular destinations for visitors.

“My family used make a living through herding sheep and camels. But as [it] started raining less, it became difficult to keep the animals and sustain a living. We had to move to the village and sell our animals,” al-Zalabeih told Al Jazeera.

The al-Zalabeih family gives guided tours and runs a camp for travellers.

According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification, which uses colours and shades to categorise the world into climate zones based on criteria such as temperature, Jordan will in the future be a “red” country.

This indicates it will face high temperatures and severe droughts, said Laith al-Dasouqi, an energy and climate consultant.

Al-Dasouqi, who specialises in renewable energy engineering and management, explained that Wadi Rum faces increased temperatures,water scarcity, desertification and a higher frequency of extreme weather events such asa large flood in November 2014.

Some areas in Wadi Rum face moderate to high potential of flooding, which could have dire consequences for residents, al-Dasouqi said, including disruptions in livelihood, affecting the local tourism industry, and causingsoil erosion that affects vegetation cover.

The groundwater in Wadi Rum is mainly considered non-renewable. According to observations from theBGR Water Yearbook, the groundwater level has been declining since 1996 at a fixed rate of about 1.2 metres per year.

“Higher temperatures will lead to consuming more groundwater, and this will affect not just the people who live in Wadi Rum, but the whole country,” al-Dasouqi said.

Although there has been an increase in flood frequency in Jordan, this has not meant that people have had access to more water. If anything, al-Dasouqi explained, it is ruining the soil.

The primary source of water in Jordan, including surface and groundwater, is rain, he said.

“Due to the low rainfall and high evaporation rates, it is challenging to sustain an adequate water supply. Wadi Rum receives very little rainfall per year, and in some areas the rainfall is almost zero,” he added.

According to the Standardized Precipitation Index, a statistical indicator, Jordan is experiencing a higher occurrence of drought.

“Overall, climate change can have significant impacts on the living conditions of people in Wadi Rum, affecting their access to water, food and livestock, as well as safe living conditions,” al-Dasouqi said.

Hala Murad, head of the Dibeen Association for Environmental Development, said spending money on development projects is an important tool to reduce the consequences of climate change.

“Investing in these projects [is important] for the local population in Wadi Rum and to address the danger of torrential rains, as well as creating a surrounding infrastructure that prevents the formation of local torrents. That will be important,” she told Al Jazeera.

Despite the changes in climate, al-Zalabeih and her family say they are taking it day by day and have seen an improvement in the quality of life during the past decades.

“Life is better now than when I was young. We only had camels and no cars. As the village has grown, we have also gotten schools for the kids,” she said.

She did not have the opportunity to go to school herself and said she is grateful “that it has gotten easier and better for the generations coming after me”.

Al-Zalabeih’s grandson, Salman, also lives in the village, working with tourists year round.

“We live day by day and it is hard to say how climate change will affect the area in the future. As of now, we are grateful for the rain we had this winter, and being able to sustain ourselves through tourism,” he said.

Although most tourists visiting the area are respectful, not all treat nature in the best way, according to Salman.

“We see that some tourists bring their own cars, which is dangerous when you do not know the area,” he said, explaining this often means vehicles ruining local vegetation.

He also said some tourists throw rubbish without taking nature’s best interests into consideration.

Salman said the community has noticed differences in temperatures over the years, as winters in Wadi Rum have turned colder and the summers warmer. The winters have accordingly seen an increase in rainfall, something Salman sees as a mixed blessing.

“It helps to give water to the animals in the desert, but when it gets colder it also means we need to use more electricity. It also affects the animals negatively if it gets too cold, as they might not survive the low temperatures,” he said.

Climate change,Climate change threatens Ghana’s coast,"Totope, Ghana– Ask anyone in this fishing village along Ghana’s eastern coast where they grew up, and they’ll likely point south, towards the blue waves of the Gulf of Guinea.

The ocean has encroached on areas that were once land, dry enough for the villagers of Totope to grow crops, build homes and raise families.









It’s all gone now, buried by crushing waves and shifting sands that have forced the village of a few thousand to move onto swampy land reclaimed with an unreliable mix of sand and trash.

The people here don’t think it will last.

“The future of Totope looks very, very bleak,” the village’s chief Theophilus Agbakla said.

Grain by grain, West Africa’s coasts are eroding away, the dry land sucked under the water by a destructive mix of natural erosion and human meddling.

Sediment flows in Ghana and elsewhere have been disrupted by the damming of rivers. Climate change has led to harsher storms and higher waters. Meanwhile, resurgent economies in many West African countries are bringing development closer and closer to the shore.

From Senegal to Nigeria, scientists say eroding beaches will soon pose an unavoidable threat to booming coastal populations.

A glimpse of that future can be seen in Totope. Situated with a lagoon to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, the village of less than three thousand is cursed by its geography.

Salt water seeps through the makeshift landfill that Totope rests on. Villagers walk on soggy ground, dodging creeks that run between houses, and they hang their possessions from ceiling rafters to keep them above their often-wet floors.

“Have you seen how the sea broke the town?” asked Michael Akutu, a fisherman who like most people here grew up on now submerged real estate. “Now, it’s all gone.”

Rapid coastal erosion

As the ocean pushes the shoreline back, the beach has risen up to swallow whatever gets in its way.

There’s an old Pentecostal church, still standing with sand up to its windows.

One resilient soul dug a trench and bought himself a little more time from the wall of sand that’s advancing on his house.

Agbakla says the village has land it wants to move to on the other side of the lagoon, somewhere where the water won’t get them. But no one has the money to pay for the land.

“You get fed up and you have to leave,” Agbakla said. “This the fate of Totope.”

Year by year, West Africa’s coast is retreating. By how much depends, said Kwasi Appeaning Addo, a lecturer in coastal processes at the University of Ghana.

Around Ghana’s capital Accra, the coast is eroding at one-and-a-half metres per-year, while in the eastern coast around Totope it’s three meters per-year, Addo said.

But when the weather is rough, Agbakla said the waves near the village can claim as much as ten meters a year.

Like its potency, the causes of coastal erosion vary, but Mathieu Ducrocq, a coastal scientist who coordinated a study on erosion throughout West Africa for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, said most of the causes tie back to human activity.

“The main problems come from human activities and bad coastal management,” he said.

Climate change

Ducrocq credits climate change with driving sea levels higher and making destructive storms bigger.

Ports and jetties along the coast can also disrupt the flow of sediment that nourishes beaches, Ducrocq said.

Guinea-Bissau has already lost one of its finest beaches to erosion, and Gambia’s capital Banjul had to borrow millions to regenerate a beach crucial for keeping the capital connected to the country’s roads, he said.

The problem wouldn't have been much if the rate of sea level rise had been very, very low.

byKwasi Appeaning Addo, lecturer



Beaches around Totope rely on sediment from the Volta River, Addo said, but that flow was disrupted by the construction of the Akosombo dam in 1965, which provides most of the electricity for Ghana.

“Now that we have blocked it over decades…we are experiencing the consequences,” Addo said. “The problem wouldn’t have been much if the rate of sea level rise had been very, very low.”

The rising seas are occurring amidst a rise of another kind: impressive economic growth in the economies of West African states like Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast, all of which have major cities along their coastlines.

The optimistic economic news has developers in Ghana convinced that people will fork over thousands of dollars to rent luxury condos in a trio of under-construction beachfront high-rises.

A spit of landfill off the coast of Nigeria’s mega-city Lagos will soon sit the site of Eko Atlantic, an opulent planned city for those who can afford it.

Addo says projects like these will be the first to take the hit from eroding coasts.

“In the very near future… the government will have to be called upon to look for money to protect that side,” Addo said. “I think these huge developments that are going on along the coast are something that we should discourage.”

As the sea took Totope’s houses one by one, the villagers retreated north to the banks of the Songor Lagoon, a UNESCO biosphere reserve and nesting ground for sea turtles.

Eventually, they ended up in the lagoon itself, layering plastic bags and sand together to make a semblance of dry ground.

The floors of the houses laid in the reclaimed lagoon are constantly wet with water salty enough to undo glue on shoes, Agbakla said, and the ground has to be packed down and refreshed every day.

The landfill is considered illegal, but warnings from the police and condemnation from conservationists don’t change Totope’s reality: there is nowhere else to go.

“At times you disobey the laws of the country because of certain circumstances,” Agbakla said.

The government has invested in a series of groins stretching down the coast that are meant to trap sediment and regenerate the beaches.

Addo said measures like these are double-edged; effective in repairing beaches upstream, but starving others downstream.

Agbakla is sceptical. He said the government told him it will be three years before the coastal defence project reaches Totope.

“It means that within three years, [the sea] will take 12 to 18 meters, which will take some of the village away again,” he said.

When that happens, the villagers will do what they’ve always done: lay down another layer of sand and plastic, and retreat.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2013/12/28/climate-change-threatens-ghanas-coast
Climate change,Trump nominates climate change sceptic Chris Wright as energy secretary,"President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Chris Wright, a prominent fracking magnate and outspoken climate change sceptic, to serve as energy secretary in his upcoming administration.

“As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new ‘Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,’” Trump said in a statement on Saturday.

Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, has long championed fossil fuel production as the cornerstone of economic growth, aligning closely with Trump’s vision of achieving US “energy dominance”.

“Energy is the lifeblood that makes everything in life possible,” Wright posted on X after the announcement. “I am looking forward to getting to work.”

Wright has publicly denied there is aclimate crisis. In a past LinkedIn post, he dismissed the idea of a global energy transition, asserting that “there is no climate crisis” and decrying the term “carbon pollution” as misleading.

“There is no such thing as clean energy or dirty energy, all energy sources have impacts on the world both positive and negative,” Wright wrote.

His views are emblematic of Trump’s broader scepticism towards environmental regulations and climate commitments, including the Paris Agreement, which Trump has pledged to abandon once again.

During his election campaign, Trump – who calls climate change a hoax – promised to boost the domestic fossil fuel industry in order to bring down energy prices that have driven inflation.

Wright will devise policy alongside North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, head of the newly created National Energy Council.

“We will DRILL BABY DRILL, expand ALL forms of Energy production to grow our Economy, and create good-paying jobs,” Trump said Friday as he announced Burgum’s appointment.

Wright has repeatedly criticised efforts by outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden to encourage the US’s transition to a low-carbon energy model and has downplayed the importance of solar.

Among his immediate priorities could be lifting the yearlong pause on natural gas export permits implemented under President Biden.

His views put him notably at odds with Trump’s key backer and informal adviser Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, who started the electric car company and invested heavily in solar.

Harold Hamm, a longtime Trump ally and executive chairman of shale giant Continental Resources, lauded Wright’s expertise, stating that his leadership would be crucial in expanding US fossil fuel production. Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, echoed this sentiment, saying Wright’s industry experience “gives him an important perspective” and will help bolster energy exports to US allies.

But environmental advocates have decried the choice. Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, described Wright as “a champion of dirty fossil fuels” and called his nomination “a disastrous mistake”.

“The Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,” Wong said.

The Department of Energy also oversees nuclear security, environmental cleanup of nuclear sites, and groundbreaking scientific research at its 17 national laboratories. Critics worry that Wright’s appointment could overshadow these critical missions.

Wright’s nomination is part of a broader pattern in Trump’s Cabinet selections, which feature a mix of seasoned conservatives andcontroversial figures. Otherhigh-profile picksinclude Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, for health secretary, and former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, known for her pro-Kremlin rhetoric, for director of national intelligence.

Pete Hegseth, a pro-Israel Fox News host with limited defence experience, was tapped to lead the Pentagon, while former Congressman Matt Gaetz, once investigated for alleged sex trafficking, was picked for the role of attorney general.

Climate change,‘Not fair’: Ghana slams West over low funding for climate change,"Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo has criticised Western nations for their low financial commitment to addressing issues caused by climate change on the continent.

“$55m for 54 countries – this is not fair,” Akufo-Addo was quoted as saying by French state broadcaster RFI on Monday.

Akufo-Addo who is on a six-day visit to France where he is expected to meet President Emmanuel Macron, was referring to commitments made duringa climate summit in Rotterdamlast September – $23m from the United Kingdom, $15m from Norway, $10m from France and $7m from Denmark.

“The adaptation summit had the mission of mobilising $25bn by 2025 … ridiculously, while the G20 countries are responsible for 80 percent of emissions, Africa left Rotterdam with pledges of up to $55m,” the Ghanaian leader said.

The African Development Bank pledged an additional $12.5bn to support the cause.

The Rotterdam summit was set up to discussclimate changefinancing for Africa and took place ahead of the 27th annual summit of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) to be held this November in Egypt.

It also came on the heels of a warning from the UN climate science panel that extreme weather and rising seas are hitting faster than expected, prompting calls for more money and political will to help people adapt.

The Rotterdam meeting – attended by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa and International Monetary Fund head Kristalina Georgieva – heard from representatives of African nations, small island developing states and other climate-vulnerable countries.

Western countries said they will spend about $25bn by 2025 to boost Africa’s efforts to adapt to climate change. Still, their pledges in Rotterdam fell short.

“It is a lot, of course, but it is derisory,” said Akufo-Addo, reminding that G20 countries “are responsible for 80 percent of [gas] emissions”.

For years, African leaders have said the continent is being to made to pay a heavy price by cutting off usage of fossil fuels, despite its low emissions compared with the rest of the world.

In June, just weeks after the G7 pledged to end public financing for foreign fossil-fuel projects by the end of 2022, Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum said the continent was “being punished”.

Africa emits just 2 to 3 percent of the world’s carbon emissions despite being home to nearly 17 percent of the world’s population.

It is already experiencing temperature increases of approximately 0.7°C over much of the continent, and “with predictions that temperatures will rise further, Africa is facing a wide range of [climate change] impacts, including increased drought and floods,” read a UN report.

“The impacts are massive. Africa loses today $7-15bn a year in terms of climate change, and if that doesn’t change it’s going to be about $50bn by 2040,” Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, told Al Jazeera during the Rotterdam summit.

Africa will need between $1.3 and $1.6 trillion this decade to implement its commitments to the Paris climate agreement, an annual cost between $140 and $300bn, Adesina said.

“It’s never too late [to bring about change]. What Africa needs is to mobilise resources … to allow rebuilding of infrastructure, to make it more climate resilient, and to make sure that we have better systems that can resist many of the challenges we have today.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/11/not-fair-ghana-slams-western-pledges-to-address-climate-change
Climate change,Scorching weather forces India to face climate change head on,"New Delhi, India –Construction worker Gujral Singh tears up as he voices his concerns about toiling in India’s searing heat this summer.

Tens of millions of Indians are struggling to cope with a relentless heatwave, with temperatures in some regions the hottest in more than 120 years in this South Asian nation.

“It is becoming unattainable for me to accomplish my job,” Singh, 47, a father of two, told Al Jazeera. “I could efficiently do the work the previous summer. I fainted a couple of times already during this summer. I don’t know how will I meet the end needs of my family.”

Pravesh Solanki, 32, another construction labourer, echoed the comments but noted it is not just older people facing the challenges of working outdoors in the extreme heat.

“We are young and full of energy. Still, we hold for a breather after every half an hour, which we used to take after an hour or two. This summer is extraordinarily pinching us,” said Solanki.

Addressing a recent press gathering, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director-General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said central and northwest India faced the most sizzling temperatures in 122 years in April.

This year has seen a gradual rise in maximum temperatures by 2 to 4 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 7.2 Fahrenheit) over those areas, and there will be no respite from the heat in May, IMDsaid.

Heatwaves – with temperatures ranging from 43°C to 46°C – are prevailing in 15 Indian states, including New Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat.

Surface land temperatures, meanwhile, have exceeded 60°C over some parts of northwest India, according to satellitedata.

“The extreme climate events are occurring due to climate instability. Nowadays, there are solely extremes whether it is heat, cold, floods or drought. This will occur more often than earlier because of climate change. The duration, intensity, and frequency will also rise in the future,” Akhilesh Gupta, head of the Climate Change Program at India’s Department of Science & Technology, told Al Jazeera.

Gupta said while global climate change is mostly responsible, local factors are contributing to the unprecedented heat.

“We also have local issues like the high emissions in the big cities due to which a regional ‘heat island’ is created. Heat islands are the parts of a city which are warmer than others. So, internationally global warming and locally heat islands are responsible for such heatwaves,” he added.

The threat to people’s health is increasingly dangerous in India.

“The heatwaves are fatal for public health and the economy. It also puts the ecosystem at risk,” said Avinash Chanchal, campaign manager at Greenpeace India.

“We have been witnessing an increased rate of hospitalisations also leading up to fatalities as a result of heatwaves. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable communities are facing the brunt of this crisis more than others.”

Chanchal said the government must intervene to help the urban poor, outdoor workers, women, children, and senior citizens who are at higher risk from extreme heat.

“Especially the state and city authorities must strengthen the public health system, coordinated with meteorological early warning systems to ensure timely medical advice to its citizens.”

The heatwave has severely impacted the agriculture sector in India, causing wheat crops to shrivel in states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, collectively called India’s food bowl.

“The high temperature this season did not allow the wheat to grow for a complete period,” said Tinku Yadav, 23, a farmer in Haryana.

“Earlier, the wheat would be harvested by the end of April or start of May, but during this season the wheat grains were harvested at the end of March and early April. My yield, which was nearly 22 to 24 quintals (2.2 to 2.4 tonnes) per acre last summer, has been reduced to just 16 to 18 quintals (1.6 to 1.8 tonnes).”

India is one of the most “heat-stressed” nations in the world and the increasing temperatures will only make it worse for the workforce toiling outside, say researchers.

India lost 259 billion hours of labour annually between 2001 and 2020 because of the impacts of humid heat, according to astudyby Duke University.

“Because of its large population, India is in absolute terms expected to lose the equivalent of 34 million full-time jobs in 2030 as a result of heat stress,”reportedInternational Labour Organization.

“Although most of the impact in India will be felt in the agricultural sector, more and more working hours are expected to be lost in the construction sector.”

Gardener Surajmal Singh, 53, has cycled to work and back home every day for the last 20 years – overall a 50km (31-mile) journey each day.

He said now it is too hard for him during the sweltering summer temperatures. “In the last few years, the heat has increased too much. I never halted my bicycle in between [the ride], but now I have to take a rest to drink water and cool off.”

Satendra Kumar, 32, a food delivery worker, expressed his concern for the future. “This is just the start of the summer and the heat feels like June or July … I don’t know what the coming months and years hold, but if the heat will be increasing like this it will create a major earning void for us.”

India will be seriously harmed if greenhouse gas emissions are not cut, warned Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its latestreport. It described India as potentially the most “economically harmed” because of extreme weather events. The current heatwave is also part of that change, climate experts say.

“For the last many years, people have been experiencing it in the form of heatwaves. We have enough science to link such extreme weather events to climate change,” Chanchal said.

G Ramesh, a weather scientist and retired director-general of the India Meteorological Department, confirmed global warming is to blame for recent events in India.

“Heatwaves are common, every summer India suffers from heatwaves, but this time it is earlier than usual,” he said. “The primary reason for this is global warming. Global warming is accelerating climate change because we have already crossed 1.2°C of warming from the pre-industrial era.”

With Earth heating up, polar ice is thinning out. In the Arctic, sunlight was previously reflected back into the atmosphere. But because of thinning ice, the Arctic Sea is now absorbing the heat.

“This is changing the whole circulation pattern, particularly waves coming from polar regions, which are likely to accelerate the warming and cooling seasonal patterns,” Ramesh told Al Jazeera.

“Wherever ice is melted in the non-oceanic Arctic region, below the ice methane will emit…Methane emissionsare adding to the solar heating as well. So multiple things are happening. Earth’s system is bound to respond to these global and local changes. That is why the heatwaves are happening earlier. We need to be ready to face them even more in the coming years.”

Chanchal said adaptation plans must be developed now to deal with India’s weather extremes.

“Urban planning must take measures for vegetation plantations, including rooftop gardening and community nutritional gardens, increase green spaces, and conserve the water bodies,” he said.

“At the same time the government, corporations, and society need to prioritise transition in energy, agriculture, and other sectors to tackle climate change. Phasing out the burning [of] fossil fuels – including energy and transportation systems – is the most practical and urgent solution governments need to implement to protect the public health and future generations.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/2/scorching-weather-forces-india-to-face-climate-change-head-on
Climate change,"Biden says China, Russia failed to lead at COP26 climate summit","United States President Joe Biden has accused China and Russia of failing to show leadership on addressing climate change, saying he believes it was a “big mistake” for his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to not attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference(COP26).

Speaking on the sidelines of the summit on Tuesday, Biden said his own presence at the event in Glasgow, Scotland, showed that “America is back” afterthe “America First” foreign policy approachof former President Donald Trump.

“The fact that China is trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader – not showing up, come on!” Biden told reporters before flying out of Glasgow.

“It just is a gigantic issue and they walked away. How do you do that and claim to be able to have any leadership?” Biden said. “It’s been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China not showing up. The rest of the world looked at China and said ‘What value are they providing?'”

Xi, who leads the world’s largest emitter of carbon emissions, has not travelled outside of China since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.







Biden’s comments come as the US and China are seeking to improve diplomatic relations amid several points of tension, including concerns in Washington over Beijing’s recent military actions in Taiwan’s air defence zone and China’s human rights record.

Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up cross-strait activities this year, with the number of recorded incidents on track to be double the level of 2020.

A senior US officialsaidlast month that Biden and Xi planned to hold a virtual bilateral meeting before the end of the year amid the tensions.

Xi and Biden spoke by phone on September 9 in what the White House said was part of an “ongoing effort to responsibly manage the competition” between the countries.

That call ended a nearly seven-month gap in direct communication between the leaders.

Biden said on Tuesday that he hoped their talks would bring more predictability in relations. “I’m going to be clear. This is competition; it does not have to be conflict,” he said.

“I have also indicated to him – and I’m not reluctant to say it publicly – that we expect him to play by the rules of the road.”

Rafe Pomerance, a distinguished senior Arctic policy fellow at the US-based Woodwell Climate Research Center, said on Tuesday that he was disappointed the Chinese president did not attend the COP26 conference.

“I think their [climate change] commitment hasn’t grown significantly,” Pomerance told Al Jazeera about China’s policies.







“I think the pressure will build on the Chinese. They are vulnerable to climate change in many regions and have to change course. They’ve got the same problem as many others, in fact worse … so they’re going to have to come around in a bigger way,” he said.

Meanwhile, Biden on Tuesday also slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is not attending COP26, on the climate file. Russia is the world’s fourth-largest source of carbon emissions.

“His tundra is burning – literally, the tundra is burning. He has serious, serious climate problems, and he is mum on willingness to do anything,” the US president said.

Russia approved a long-term government climate strategy earlier this week targeting carbon neutrality by 2060, however, and it has rejected earlier US allegations it was not doing enough on climate change.

“Russia as a country is making enormous efforts and will continue to do so systematically to reduce the anthropogenic burden on the climate, but this is a process that requires adequate measures on the part of all states,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

Putin met Biden in June in Geneva, where theyannouncedthat the two nations had agreed to enter into a bilateral dialogue on “strategic stability” aimed at reducing the risks of unintentional conflict and restraining nuclear weapons.

This week, CIA Director William Burns is making a rare visit to Moscow to discuss the US-Russia relationship. A US Embassy spokesperson said Burns was leading a delegation of senior US officials to Moscow on Tuesday and Wednesday at Biden’s request.

“They are meeting with members of the Russian government to discuss a range of issues in the bilateral relationship,” the spokesperson said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/2/biden-says-china-russia-failed-to-lead-cop26-climate-summit
Climate change,A moment of reckoning – when coronavirus meets climate change,"In the midst of economic shocks and border closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Pacific region has yet again been ravaged by a Category 5 cyclone that left a trail of destruction across four Pacific island countries in a span of four days from April 5 to 8.

The economic toll from Cyclone Harold and the response to the coronavirus pandemic to Pacific economies is yet to be determined, but they have for sure rolled backed significant economic gains in these countries.









The economic, social and environmental impacts of the pandemic, exacerbated by climate-induced disasters such as tropical Cyclone Harold, will reverberate well into the future for these countries.

COVID-19 and climate change have re-emphasised the fragility of Pacific economies and their acute vulnerability to global phenomena.

Oxfam’s report on the potential economic impact of the coronavirus –Dignity not Destitution– demonstrates that the scenario unfolding in the Pacific is a reality that most vulnerable and poor developing countries in the Global South could relate to in light of the current global precarity and uncertainty.

The Pacific double whammy brings us to an important moment for the world to reexamine our current approach to development, specifically the dominant economic model that prioritises profit over people and the environment.

Both COVID-19 and climate change continue to expose the failures in our economic structures and the need to change our approach to how our economies are governed.

Inequality is perhaps the most obvious flaw of the current economic model. Both cyclones and pandemics exacerbate the persistent inequalities at different levels of our societies.

Those who are bound to suffer the most from the extreme effects of these two phenomena are the poorest and the “have nots” in societies.

In a global economy where the world’s richest one percent of people have more than twice as much wealth as 4.6 billion of the poorest people on earth, according to a report byOxfam in 2020, the ability of the majority of the population right now to access the resources they need to holistically build their resilience and bounce back from global crisis is severely limited and in some cases non-existent.

Oxfam’s briefing,Dignity not Destitution, forecasts that half a billion more people are now likely to be pushed into poverty because of the pandemic without an urgent and a human-oriented emergency global rescue package that is compassionate towards the needs of world’s poorest and vulnerable countries.

What we need is a global rescue package that not only focuses on protecting small businesses but one that also provides safety nets to the most vulnerable populations.

Importantly, the pandemic and climate change have once again shone a harsh light on the persistent social gendered inequalities in our communities.

The plight of women and girls in all their diversity during times of crisis has again been laid bare. While different groups are affected differentlyduring times of crisis, the economic burdens and hardships are disproportionately borne by women.

As the global economy is currently at a standstill, women are increasingly taking on more domestic and family workloads, exposing them to greater health and social risks.

This gendered inequality extends well beyond the informal care economy, now, into the formal labour market. The core labourers of the essential services that are now holding the very fabric of our society together are made up primarily of women.

Women account for the majority at the front line of the retail, agriculture and healthcare sectors ­- essential sectors that for so long have been underappreciated and overburdened.

Ironically, the very people we have so far neglected to invest in and empower are the very ones who are now working overtime, under stressful circumstances and poor labour conditions. They are the ones that we are now pinning our hopes on to carry us through these precarious times.

The ongoing climate crisis and the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic remind us about the folly of turning our backs on the values that we hold dear in our societies. This crisis has brought to the fore the fact that what we turn to for safety, comfort and solace in hard times are our relationships, our kinship and our human connections and compassion.

The demand that we look after each other will always be our fall-back position. It is critical that these values are given more prominence in the new ways of governing our affairs as we try to both contain the impact of the crisis and, at the same time, map a pathway for economic recovery.

Governments need to heed the painful lessons of both the impacts of climate change and the pandemic. They need to act urgently towards transitioning our economic model towards one that is caring, humane and just, rather than just fuelling the endless pursuit of profit.

More importantly, it is also critical that we channel our investment priorities towards building and strengthening functioning social protection systems so that we are able to respond effectively to global crises like pandemics, or more localised disasters like Cyclone Harold.

Governments must reverse the past trend of shirking their responsibilities for providing essential services to their citizens, specifically in the provision of social protections, health, housing, water and other utilities, and instead selling them out to private corporations, which are driven solely by wealth creation, or relying on struggling charities.

In re-prioritising national economic strategies during the post-crisis situation, consideration of gender and class-based inequalities, as well as human rights, must become integral components to ensure that the economy will work for all of us, instead of a privileged few.

We are now approaching a crossroads; we can either continue with the business-as-usual way of development, or we can change: We transform the way we do things and build an economy that nurtures our people and our planet.

This is the political choice that is at stake. For our sake, and the sake of our children, we urge our leaders to choose the latter, because sticking with the status quo will only bring about more suffering and destruction to our world.

Climate change,"Climate change, food shortages, and conflict in Mali","Menaka, Mali –Life has never been easy in MoussaMajga’scorner of northern Mali, a desert region of leafless trees, mud huts, and roaming gunmen.

For years, violence has plaguedMajga’sdusty town, the scene of clashes between government forces and Tuareg-led separatists who took advantage of a 2012 coup in Mali’s capital Bamako to escalate their uprising.









But today, the biggest security concern for the ageing chieftain is a new cycle of ferocious drought he blames on climate change that is ravaging his people.









“There is a crisis due to the lack of rain,” said Majga, sporting a white robe and thick, knock-off designer watch, during a community meeting in the town now controlledby the rebel Movement for the National Liberation of Azawad (MNLA).

A dozen local residents nodded in agreement.

Mali’s average rainfall has dropped by 30 percent since 1998 with droughts becoming longer and more frequent, according to a2013 study by the US army’sStrategic Studies Institute.

As a consequence,hunger is a chronic problemin the West African country with more than 1.8 million people, including 660,000 children, in need of food aid.

But the situation is worse in the north, which was briefly seized in 2012 by Tuareg separatists allied with Islamic fighters until a French-led military operation scattered them.

Here, some270,000 people face starvation,according to figures from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (UNFAO).

Expanding desert

For generations, people from Menaka wandered the land with their cows and goats in search of water and grass for grazing. Now even this is under threat, Majga said.

The Sahara desert is expanding southward at a rate of 48km a year, forcing whole communities to migrate and pushing them on to land occupied by other groups,researchers said in a 2011 study.

Herders from other regions, and even neighbouring countries such as Algeriaand Niger, are moving onto territory thatMajga’smostly Tuareg community uses for grazing.

“This will destroy the land even more,” and cause inter-communal conflicts, said Majga.

Researchers have long warned of the risk that climate change would worsen conflict in many of the world’s poorest regions, as different groups struggling to cope with poor rains and growing desertification, take up arms to fight over scarce resources.

Last year, the Brookings Institute published a study showing thefrequency of cross-border violence grows by 4 percent, while inter-group violence – the kind seen in Mali – rises 14 percent for each percentage change in average temperature and rainfall.

Warning signs

Pittsburgh State UniversityprofessorSteve Harmon said water shortages linked to global warming is one of the factors fuelling the latest Tuareg revolt in a country that has had four rebellions since winning independence from France in 1960.

“The droughts of the 1970s and 1980s in the Sahel were kind of the canary in the coal mine for climate change [causing violence],” said Harmon.

The droughts decimated Tuareg animal herds, the main source of wealth and sustenance for the nomadic community.

After losing their livelihoods as the climate became more erratic, many Tuareg fled to neighbouring Libya, often serving in the security forces of ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Following Gaddafi’s killing in 2011, many Tuareg returned home and launched their latest uprising.

“The current crisis … coincided with a period of drought and famine,” said Dona Stewart, a former US military analyst.

“Environmental issues certainly can exacerbate the economic and political drivers of conflict,” she said, adding it was impossible to draw a direct causal link between climate change and ongoing violence.

UN-brokered peace talks between Mali’s government and theMNLA have stalled several times.

Adeal is expected to be signed on May 15 in Algeria,but, Stewart predicted violence is likely to continue even if that happens, since al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters and other armed groups operating in the north are not part of the negotiations.

Food for rebellion

The links between climate change, violence and basic human needs are not lost on Malian government officials.

“In the north there is such poverty, the environment is so tough, that when the jihadists come they find it easy to get followers,” Paul Coulibaly, a senior adviser to Mali’s agriculture ministry, said in an interview in his air-conditioned office in Bamako.

“Even if they [fighters] don’t bring money – just food – they will find allies if they can feed people,” Coulibaly said.

Chief Majga, however, does not believe the government really understands the problems his community faces.

Echoing one of the major grievances of the Tuareg separatists, he said the Bamako government had neglected the region and was responsible for its poverty.

“The government hasn’t done anything,” Majga said.

Officials back in the capital said action was being taken to address some of the problems caused by climate change, pointing to new irrigation efforts and other plans to offset a warming planet.

But they also acknowledged global warming was making it harder to produce food in Mali, and fuelling at least some of the strife the country currently faces.

“The link between food security and political security is plainly obvious,” Coulibaly said.

Climate change,Climate change threatens Europe’s once ‘placid’ Alpine glaciers,"Glaciers in Europe’s Alps are becoming more unstable and dangerous as rising temperatures linked to climate change are reawakening what were long seen as dormant, almost fossilised sheets of ice.

Italy has been baking in an early summer heatwave, and in the Italian Dolomite Mountainstragedy struck on Sundaywhen a glacier collapsed on the highest peak in the range – Marmolada – killing at least seven people.

Another 14 people remain missing and authorities have cautioned that it is not clear how many people were on the 3,300-metre mountain when the glacier gave way.

Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Monday linked the collapse to climate change.

The collapse of the glacier was “without doubt linked to the deterioration of the environment and the climate situation”, Draghi said during a visit to the headquarters of the rescue operation in the Dolomites.

What caused a pinnacle of the glacier to break off and thunder down the slope – at a speed estimated by experts at some 300kph (186 mph), sending huge chunks of ice, snow and rocks slamming into hikers – was not immediately known.

But the tragedy struck one day after a record-high temperature of 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded at the summit of the glacier, which has been rapidly melting over the past decades, with much of its volume gone.

“This summer 2022 risks being the perfect storm for glaciers,” said Giovanni Baccolo, an environmental scientist and glaciologist at Milan-Bicocca University, noting a lack of winter snow and a ferociously hot start to summer in Italy.

“Nobody could have expected a glacier like the Marmolada to react like this,” he told Reuters.

“It is a kind of climatic fossil, glaciers like the Marmolada are considered ‘placid’, they are expected to just retreat.”

Baccolo said intrepid hikers heading into the mountains to escape the summer heat should be careful about where they venture, as it “may no longer be enough to read the signs from the glacier that have been read so far”.

Glaciers at high, steep elevations such as the Marmolada rely on temperatures below zero degrees Celsius “to keep them stable”, said Poul Christoffersen, professor in glaciology at the University of Cambridge.

“But climate change means more and more meltwater, which releases heat that warms up the ice if the water re-freezes, or even worse: lifting up the glacier from the rock below and causing a sudden unstable collapse,” he said.

The Mediterranean basin, which includes southern European countries like Italy, has been identified by United Nations experts as a “climate change hot spot”, likely to suffer heatwaves and water shortages, among other consequences.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/4/climate-change-threatens-europes-once-placid-alpine-glaciers
Climate change,African nations demand climate change financing ahead of COP27,"The leaders of two dozen African countries have urged wealthier nations to uphold their aid pledgesso the continent can tackle climate change effectsfor which it shares little blame.

African ministers made their call in a communique at the close of a three-day forum in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Friday and two months before Egypt hosts the crucialCOP27 climate conferencein Sharm El-Sheikh in November.

We urge “developed countries to fulfil their pledges in relation to climate and development finance, and deliver on their commitments to double adaptation finance, in particular to Africa,” the 24 leaders said in a closing statement.

The African continent emits only some three percent of global CO2 emissions, former UN chief Ban Ki-moon noted this week.

And yetAfrican nations are among those most exposedto the effects of climate change, notably worsening droughts and floods.

The African leaders said the financial aid was needed in view of “the disproportionate impact of climate change and nature loss on the African continent”.

Africa not only has a “low carbon footprint”, they said, but it also plays a key role in capturing greenhouse gases, including in the Congo Basin, which is home to the world’s second-largest tropical rainforest after the Amazon.

The communique urged rich countries to meet and expand climate pledges, and said poor countries should be able to develop economically while receivingmore funds to adapt to the effects of climate change.

The document stressed “the need to avoid approaches that encourage abrupt disinvestments from fossil fuels, as this will … threaten Africa’s development”.

The role of gas in the transition to cleaner energy is set to be a key point of contention at COP27. Climate activists say it needs to be quickly phased out and replaced with renewables.

But, Nigerian finance minister Zainab Ahmed told the Cairo forum that gas was a matter of survival for her country.

“If we are not getting reasonably-priced finance to develop gas, we are denying the citizens in our countries the opportunities to attain basic development,” she said.

The communique also called for focusing on climate change in a review of multilateral development banks and international financial institutions. It suggested the creation of a sustainable sovereign debt hub that could reduce the cost of capital for developing states and support debt-for-nature swaps.

Funding to help poorer countries curb their emissions and strengthen their resilience will be a key issue at COP27.

A longstanding goal for developed countries to spend $100bn a year from 2020 onhelping vulnerable nations adapt to climate change remains unmet.

According to the African Development Bank, the continent will need as much as $1.6 trillion between 2020 and 2030 for its own efforts to limit climate change and to adapt to the adverse effects that are already apparent.

Kevin Chika Urama, chief economist at the African Development Bank, said Africa faced a climate financing gap of about $108bn each year.

“Climate finance structure today is actually biased against climate-vulnerable countries. The more vulnerable you are the less climate finance you receive,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/10/african-nations-demand-climate-change-financing-ahead-of-cop27
Climate change,The long fight against climate change deniers,"When climate scientist Peter Stott checked into his flight from London to Moscow in July 2004, his excitement gave way to shock when a colleague explained their agreed schedule had been ripped up.

They had expected to compare findings and strengthen ties with counterparts in Russia – but discovered key promoters of the unscientific view that humans have no key role in driving climate change had been invited, too.

“It was an ambush,” Stott said.

The meeting at the Russian Academy of Sciences had been changed by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s then-adviser Andrei Illarionov, an ardent critic of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 United Nations deal to cut emissions, which was awaiting ratification by Russia.

“He was using scientists as tools in his propaganda war,” said Stott, who specialised in identifying man-made and natural causes of climate change at the United Kingdom’s Met Office and the University of Exeter.

Stott and his colleagues were tasked with debating sceptics including Richard Lindzen, a climate contrarian who was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the time, and controversial British weather forecaster Piers Corbyn. Stott described the experience of having to defend climate science in Russia as “very threatening”.

He detailed the events in his book, Hot Air: The Inside Story of the Battle Against Climate Change Denial, which has been shortlisted for the prestigious Royal Society Science Book Prize.

He recounted how he was the first scientist to connect an individual weather event to human-induced climate change, when, in 2004, he published a paper in the journal Nature linking greenhouse gas emissions to deadly European heatwaves that had killed more than 70,000 people a year earlier.

Such “attribution science” has become a staple in determining how much of a role global warming played in disasters – a change that has helped drive a surge in lawsuits against major climate polluters.

Stott has since devoted decades of work to raising awareness about the connection between human burning of fossil fuels and climate change, particularly in his role as an author on several assessment reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

A string of climate change deniers – many linked to fossil fuel interests – have challenged the findings of scientists like Stott and sought to downplay the significance of global warming and humanity’s role in driving it.

When Stott was starting in the 1990s, the science connecting climate change with human causes was becoming stronger, with a 1995 IPCC report saying “the balance of evidence … suggests a discernible human influence on global climate”.

Stott said such scientific developments led to a surge of opposing voices who “choose arguments that suit their agendas and … don’t scrutinise their own arguments”.

A good scientist is genuinely sceptical of their own and other people’s work because “that’s how science works”, he said.

Over time, Stott said he has learned to combat arguments from climate deniers more effectively by defending the science without getting drawn into “zombie arguments”.

“As scientists, we try to bat them down and they come back to life again,” he said. But “the risk is that if we’re just forever rebutting arguments, we could never get beyond that.”

The scientific process concentrates on what remains unknown, Stott said, so scientists must state the facts that are clearly established facts about climate change upfront to avoid any public uncertainty.

One of the biggest setbacks in the battle against climate denial came in 2009 with the scandal known as “Climategate”, Stott said.

Hackers broke into the email system of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the UK’s University of East Anglia and posted online thousands of messages sent between scientists.

Climate deniers said the messages showed the CRU had conspired to distort or exaggerate the science behind global warming.

Several inquiries cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing, but Stott said the scandal contributed to the failure of the UN climate conference in Copenhagen which took place a few weeks later.

“That should have been the moment when a landmark agreement was reached,” he said.

It was years later, with the 2015 Paris Agreement, that governments agreed to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), with an aim of 1.5C (2.7F).

“We lost at least six years [of progress] in that time,” Stott said – a critical delay with scientists saying still-rising emissions must now plunge by nearly half from current levels by 2030.

Today, he said, scientists increasingly have the ears of political leaders and the public, especially as extreme weather has highlighted swiftly increasing climate threats.

But attention has not translated into sufficient action, he said, and climate denial is still an obstacle, with a range of lobbyists and campaign groups demanding a delay in climate action, which they say puts heavy costs on households and businesses.

“In the current context of our climate crisis, that’s really dangerous because we don’t have time,” Stott said.

A study published in September in the journal Science found that four dangerous planetary tipping points are “likely” above 1.5C of warming above preindustrial temperatures – a level that could be passed within a decade.

One – accelerating melting leading to the eventual collapse of the Greenland ice sheet – may have already been triggered, some believe, setting in motion seven metres (23 feet) of sea level rise over time, enough to swamp key coastal cities.

At the upcoming COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt, countries need to boost their plans to cut emissions, Stott said – something few have so far done.

Stott said morale in the scientific community is flagging as emissions keep rising and impacts growing. He said he despairs at the destruction of the natural world and the “seeming lack of progress” to make economies more sustainable.

But more people around the world have begun greening their behaviour in recent years, from installing solar panels to buying electric cars and adopting more sustainable diets.

“There’s this big groundswell of things happening,” Stott said. “So, that’s where the hope comes in.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/10/20/the-long-fight-against-climate-change-deniers
Climate change,Climate change increases risk of new viruses emerging: Research,"Climate change will drive animals towards cooler areas where their first encounters with other species will vastly increase the risk of new viruses infecting humans, researchers warned on Thursday.

There are currently at least 10,000 viruses “circulating silently” among wild mammals that have the capacity to cross over into humans, mostly in the depths of tropical forests.

As rising temperatures force those mammals to abandon their native habitats, they will meet other species for the first time, creating at least 15,000 new instances of viruses jumping between animals by 2070, according to a study published in the journal Nature.

“We have demonstrated a novel and potentially devastating mechanism for disease emergence that could threaten the health of animal populations in the future, which will most likely have ramifications for our health too,” said study co-author Gregory Albery, a disease ecologist at Georgetown University.

“This work provides us with more incontrovertible evidence that the coming decades will not only be hotter, but sicker,” Albery said.

The study, five years in the making, looked at 3,139 species of mammals, modelling how their movements would change under a range of global warming scenarios, then analysing how viral transmission would be affected.

Researchers found that new contacts between different mammals would effectively double, with first encounters occurring everywhere in the world, but particularly concentrated in tropical Africa and Southeast Asia.

Global warming will also cause those first contacts to take place in more highly populated areas, where people “are likely to be vulnerable, and some viruses will be able to spread globally from any of these population centres”, according to the research.

Likely hot spots include the Sahel, the Ethiopian Highlands and the Rift Valley, India, eastern China, Indonesia, the Philippines and some European population centres, the study found.

The research was completed just weeks before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but emphasised the unique threat posed by bats, in which COVID-19 is believed to have first emerged. As the only mammal that can fly, bats can travel far greater distances than their land-bound brethren, spreading disease as they go.

Bats are believed to already be on the move, and the study found they accounted for a large majority of potential first encounters with other mammals, mostly in Southeast Asia.

Even if the world does massively and quickly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions – a scenario that still seems some way off – it might not help for this problem.

The modelling showed that the mildest climate change scenarios could lead to more cross-species transmission than the worst-case scenarios, because slower warming gives the animals more time to travel.

The researchers also tried to work out when the first encounters between species could start happening, expecting it would be later this century.

But “surprisingly” their projections found that most first contacts would be between 2011 and 2040, steadily increasing from there.

“This is happening. It is not preventable even in the best-case climate change scenarios, and we need to put measures in place to build health infrastructure to protect animal and human populations,” Albery said.

The researchers emphasised that while they had focused on mammals, other animals could harbour zoonotic viruses – the name for viruses that jump from animals to humans.

They called for further research on the threat posed by birds, amphibians and even marine mammals, as melting sea ice allows them to mingle more.

The study’s co-author Colin Carlson, a global change biologist also at Georgetown, said climate change is “creating innumerable hot spots of future zoonotic risk – or present-day zoonotic risk – right in our backyard”.

“We have to acknowledge that climate change is going to be the biggest upstream driver of disease emergence,” Carlson said, “and we have to build health systems that are ready for that.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/28/climate-change-increasing-risk-of-new-viruses-emerging-research
Climate change,Can MENA countries fight climate change the same way?,"Global climate talks are coming to the hottest and driest part of the planet.

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will host the next United Nations climate change conference where decision-makers from around the world will come together to agree on actions required to limit rising temperatures.

Last year, governments made apactduring COP26 – the climate summit that took place in the United Kingdom’s city of Glasgow, to prevent the planet from heating more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by mid-century, a threshold that if surpassed could havecatastrophic results for humans and ecosystems.

At the same time,Egyptwas selected to host COP27 this November in Sharm El-Sheikh, a resort town located between the desert of the Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea. Incidentally, COP28 will also happen in MENA in theUnited Arab Emiratesthe following year.

Since the UN meetings began back in 1995, the region has accommodated the international climate change conferences known asCOPsonly a few times – twice in Marrakesh, Morocco, and once in Doha, Qatar, almost a decade ago.

Climate meetings are where leaders presentnational targetsand proposals for cutting back emissions of greenhouse gases. The main objective is to get governments to prevent the release of large quantities of emissions into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels.

The problem, however, is that about 80 percent of the world’s power comes from coal, oil and gas, and most nations are heavily reliant on these for their energy needs. Current energy mixes need to be replaced with greener alternatives, but in practice, fossil fuels are still very much running the show.

The International Energy Agencyrecordedthe highest yearly level of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy sector in 2021.

Transforming energy systems is costly and is a difficult undertaking worldwide. For oil and gas producers in MENA, this task is even harder given that 95 percent of their electricity is generated from fossil fuels.

Climate change has also been drying and warming the regionfasterthan anywhere else on Earth, making it more vulnerable to extreme weather events such as drought.

A pathway for the region that is safe and fair must be created and COP27 can serve as the platform to do that, analysts have said.

“Climate change negotiations tend to focus mainly on energy and decarbonisation while other important issues such as justice and water scarcity are not getting the attention they deserve,” Kaveh Madani of United Nations University and head of Iran’s delegation to COP23 told Al Jazeera.

“Prescribing identical solution measures is wrong because not all countries have access to equal resources and opportunities,” Madani added.

MENA watchers have used the negotiations in Egypt to bring the region into focus, particularly regarding the challenges it faces in transitioning to clean energy.

The most recentassessmentby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change left no doubt that quick and deep emission cuts will have to take place across all economies, including in MENA, to prevent the worst effects of global warming from happening.

To do that, predominantly fossil fuel energy mixes in the region will need to start including more alternative sources. Renewables such as solar and wind have been considered possible alternatives.

Hydropower, however, may be the least desirable because electricity is generated by reservoirs of water barricaded by large dams and excessivedambuilding for energy and agricultural purposes in the region has already contributed to majorriversin Iran, Syria, Iraq andEgyptdrying up.

“Water, energy, and environment are three interconnected factors. They are the pillars that define the quality of life in any country … If one goes wrong the others follow,” said Essam Heggy, a scientist at the University of Southern California.

So, whether it is at the climate summit in Egypt or the UAE, “any discussion on clean energy in MENA will have to address the issue of water management in the region,” added Heggy.

Most countries in the Middle East and North Africa have economies that depend solely on revenue derived from the production and export of oil and gas.

Energy transitioning means complying with international climateagreements, a scenario in which, by the year 2050, all greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere are offset.

For this to happen, MENA countries will need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, not all governments can commit to this timeframe simultaneously.

With COP27 on the horizon, it is likely that more nations, includingEgypt, will be pressured into submitting decarbonisation plans faster. Some wealthy countries such asSaudi Arabiaand theUAEhave already done so.

But green financing opportunities are not equal across the region.Iran, for example, one of the highest carbon emitters in the world, is prohibited from receiving foreign investment to develop its renewable energy sector because of US sanctions.

War-ravaged nations, such asIraqandSyria, in the Middle East will also have trouble allocating the money needed for reconstructing cities and industries with clean energy.

Moreover, decision-makers in MENA have said developed economies, such as the United States, the EU, and China – the most responsible historically for greenhouse gas pollution, should help pay for the technology they need for decarbonisation.

According to asurveypublished by management consultancy McKinsey, lower-income fossil fuel-based nations will have to spend significantly more on transitioning given their high exposure to climate change and its damages.

In their defence and the interest of fairness, mitigation cannot be expected to occur the same way across the MENA region.

As Ali Ahmad, energy and climate change specialist at the World Bank told Al Jazeera, “obstacles facing the region are very country specific, each one has its own political economy considerations that shapes the pace and depth of its energy transition pathway.”

Global oil and gas markets have changed significantly since COP26 concluded in Glasgow, Scotland, last November with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the plethora of sanctions that followed on Moscow.

To keep the security and costs of its energy sector in check, the EU will have to find a new partner to provide it with the gas it currently gets from Russia.Specfically, countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

Iran, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypthavesome of the world’s largest gas reserves, and possess the expertise in using it for both domestic energy intake, as well as for exports.

“It’s really likely that over the next few years Europe will start replacing its gas imports from Russia, and so basically the gas that is produced in MENA will find a renewed market at possibly a higher price,” Ahmad said.

EgyptandQatarare already reaping the rewards having signed major deals with the Europeans for the development of the liquefied form of natural gas (LNG), which can be easily delivered by tankers rather than pipelines.

Even though natural gas is notoriously bad for the atmosphere and releases huge amounts ofmethane– the second-leading contributor to human-induced climate change – it is being championed as a bridging agent that can help pave the way for MENA’s transition to clean energy.

Natural gas emits about 45 percent less CO2 than oil and coal and has been recognised as thecleanestform of fossil fuel by the International Energy Agency.

Solar, wind, andgreen hydrogenare better options to constitute MENA’s future energy mixes, but “we need to check and evaluate which one of these fuels has a well-established supply chain and existing infrastructure to fill the gap in energy transition for now, and the answer is natural gas,”Farid Safari, visiting research fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Al Jazeera.

Ultimately for the Middle East and North Africa, “the energy mix will differ by country and really depends on the region and the range of circumstances – including renewable resources, access to capital, and available alternatives,” Ali al-Saffar, Middle East and North Africa programme manager at the International Energy Agency, told Al Jazeera.

Climate change,Climate change causes 2m deaths in 50 years; poor suffer most: UN,"Extreme weather has caused the deaths of 2 million people and $4.3 trillion in economic damage over the past half a century, a report by the United Nations finds.

According to the new figures published on Monday from the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), 11,778 weather-related disasters have occurred from 1970 to 2021, and they have surged over that period.

The report found that more than 90 percent of deaths reported worldwide due to these disasters took place in developing countries.

“The most vulnerable communities unfortunately bear the brunt of weather, climate and water-related hazards,” WMO chief Petteri Taalas said in a statement.

Cyclone Mocha, which wreaked havoc in Myanmar and Bangladesh last week, exemplified this reality, Taalas said.

The severe storm “caused widespread devastation, … impacting the poorest of the poor”, he said.







But the WMO also said improved early warning systems and coordinated disaster management had significantly reduced human casualties.

Taalas pointed out that during disasters similar to Mocha in the past, “both Myanmar and Bangladesh suffered death tolls of tens and even hundreds of thousands of people.” Myanmar’s military government has put the death toll from the latest cyclone at 145, but there are fears the number ishigher.

In a 2021 report covering disaster-linked deaths and losses from 1970 to 2019, the agency had pointed out that at the beginning of the period, the world saw more than 50,000 such deaths each year. By the 2010s, the disaster death toll had dropped to below 20,000 annually.

And in its update of that report, the WMO said Monday that 22,608 disaster deaths were recorded globally in 2020 and 2021 combined.

“Thanks to early warnings and disaster management these catastrophic mortality rates are now thankfully history,” the report said. “Early warnings save lives.”

The UN has launched a plan to ensure all nations are covered by disaster early warning systems by the end of 2027. To date, only half of the world’s countries have such systems in place.







The WMO, meanwhile, warned that while deaths have plunged, the economic losses incurred in weather-related disasters have soared.

The agency previously recorded economic losses had increased sevenfold from 1970 to 2019, rising from $49m per day during the first decade to $383m per day in the final one.

Wealthy countries have been hardest hit by far in monetary terms.

Developed nations accounted for more than 60 percent of losses due to weather, climate and water disasters, but in more than four-fifths of cases, the economic losses for each disaster were equivalent to less than 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).

Climate change,Cholera: An overlooked outcome of climate change,"In the 21st century, every case of and every death from cholera is preventable. Yet to this day, children around the world are still suffering and dying unnecessarily from the disease – and climate change is making the situation worse.

Climate change-related extreme weather and the destruction it causes are making headlines on a regular basis across the world. Yet the profound health implications of the climate emergency are often left untold.









Cholera is a diarrhoeal illness that spreads in places where access to clean water is limited and people end up consuming contaminated food and water. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices also accelerate its spread.

Cholera is completely preventable but also extremely dangerous, causing severe dehydration, diarrhoea and vomiting – symptoms that can kill within hours without treatment.

Combined with climate change, this bacterial illness poses an imminent threat to vulnerable communities across the world. In recent years, as the climate crisis has become more severe, there has also been a major surge in the number of cholera outbreaks across the world. We have seen repeatedly in different countries and communities climate-related intense tropical storms, heavy rains and  flooding which damage or destroy water and sanitation infrastructure and cause untreated sewage to spill into clean water sources, and triggering cholera outbreaks. According toUNICEF,  30 countries faced cholera outbreaks in 2022 – an alarming 145 percent increase from the previous five-year average..

Zambia, for example, is currently experiencing its worst cholera outbreak to date with more than 18,000 confirmed infections. The disease has already killed more than 600 people, a third of them children, and led to aid agencies warning of an “uncontrollable health crisis” in the country.

The continued suffering caused by cholera in countries classified as least developed by the United Nations, like Zambia, exposes the deep inequalities within global society and the inadequacy of sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene access among poorer communities.

More than a quarter (28 percent) of households in Zambia do not have access to clean water. In rural areas, this figure rises to 42 percent. So it is not surprising that the country is currently experiencing a deadly cholera outbreak.

And the outbreak in Zambia is already spreading to neighbouring countries, where millions of people are already struggling with access to clean water and sanitation and dealing with the aftermath of extreme weather, threatening a catastrophic regional health crisis.

Zambia’s neighbour to the east, Malawi, for example, is one of the least developed countries in the world and is still in the process of recovering from a major cholera outbreak that devastated it in 2023. Last year’s outbreak was the worst in Malawi’s history and the worst Africa has seen in the past decade. It hit the country in the aftermath of three devastating storms – Cyclone Freddy, Tropical Cyclone Gombe and Tropical Storm Ana – and severely hindered its recovery. About 59,000 cases and 1,750 deaths were recorded in the outbreak, but with many cases going unreported, these are certainly underestimates.

Yet this suffering is needless. Transmission of cholera can be stopped in its tracks – and sustainably prevented – through adequate access and investment in safe water, sanitation and hygiene. And this crisis is not limited to Southern Africa, we’re seeing surges in cholera cases in Ethiopia too.

Countries in Europe and North America – once crippled by this disease – have long eliminated the threat of cholera through the provision of safe water and sanitation services for their entire populations. These successes should be replicated in countries fighting cholera today. The catastrophic, preventable cholera outbreaks in Southern Africa must be a wake-up call for all governments and development partners to increase funding for water, hygiene and sanitation, especially at this time of crisis when climate change is fuelling a surge in waterborne diseases.

It is in the economic interest of governments to invest in water, sanitation and hygiene services and infrastructure because the cost of managing a cholera outbreak far exceeds the expense of preventing one.

The sixth UN Sustainable Development Goal of achieving “clean water and sanitation for all” by 2030 is seriously off track. For this goal to be achieved, the pace of progress needs to surge sixfold globally and twentyfold in least developed countries. There is need for immediate action, sustainable investment in clean water and a cholera-free future for all.

This is why WaterAid is calling on world leaders, governments, the private sector and donors to prioritise making safe water, decent toilets and good hygiene a reality for everyone, everywhere, especially the poorest and most vulnerable groups in climate-vulnerable regions.

In the face of the ever-growing threat of climate change, only by taking decisive action can we finally consign cholera to the history books and put an end to more unnecessary and avoidable deaths in Southern Africa and across the world.

Climate change,Asia bears biggest climate-change brunt amid extreme weather: WMO,"Asia was the region most affected by climate change, weather and water-related hazards globally last year, the United Nations weather agency has said.

In a report published on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said floods and storms were the main cause of casualties and economic damage in 2023, while the impact of heatwaves became more severe.









It found that Asia has been warming faster than the global average, with temperature rises in 2023 averaging nearly 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1961-90 average.

“Many countries in the region experienced their hottest year on record in 2023, along with a barrage of extreme conditions, from droughts and heatwaves to floods and storms,” WMO chief Celeste Saulo said in a statement.

She added that climate change “exacerbated the frequency and severity of such events”, calling the report’s conclusions “sobering”.







The agency said 79 disasters associated with water-related weather hazards were reported in Asia last year. Of those, some 80 percent were floods and storms, with more than 2,000 deaths and nine million people directly affected.

The State of the Climate in Asia 2023 report also found that floods were the leading cause of death in reported events in 2023 “by a substantial margin”.

Hong Kong recorded 158.1mm (6.2 inches) of rainfall in one hour on September 7 – the highest since records began in 1884 – as a result of a typhoon.

The report also highlighted that most glaciers in the high mountain region in Asia had lost significant mass because of record-breaking high temperatures and dry conditions.

Precipitation was below normal in the Himalayas and in the Hindu Kush mountain ranges in Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2023, while southwest China suffered from a drought, with below-normal precipitation levels in nearly every month of the year.

Particularly high average temperatures were recorded from western Siberia to Central Asia, and from eastern China to Japan, the report said, with Japan having its hottest summer on record.

The report comes as a number of Asian countries have been hit by severe floods in recent weeks.

In southern China, more than 100,000 people were evacuated on Tuesday due to heavy rain and floods that have killed at least four people. Meanwhile, authorities in Afghanistan and Pakistan last weekdeclared a state of emergencyin some regions after heavy rains and flash floods killed at least 100 people.

The WMO said there was an urgent need for national weather services across Asia to improve tailored information to officials working on reducing disaster risks.

“It is imperative that our actions and strategies mirror the urgency of these times,” said Saulo.

“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the evolving climate is not merely an option, but a fundamental necessity.”

Peter Newman, professor of sustainability at Curtin University, told Al Jazeera that climate change is a “war that we are inducing onto ourselves,” adding that the world is in the middle of climate crisis that is expected to get worse until net zero emissions are implemented thoroughly.

“If we can do that by 2040, for example, then immediately, we would start to get on top of it all, but until then we are going to have to expect more damage from floods, fires and all kinds of weather changes,” he said.

He referred to the recent floods across Asia as a “terrific wake-up call”, adding that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, of which he’s a co-ordinating lead author, has been predicting changes for some time, but that they have “come quicker than we thought”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/23/asia-bears-biggest-climate-change-brunt-amid-extreme-weather-wmo
Climate change,Climate migration will worsen the brutality in the Mediterranean,"In July 2018, an Italian-flagged oil supply ship called the Asso Ventotto that was crossing the Mediterranean Sea encountered a stalled rubber raft carrying 101 desperate migrants. Trying to make the dangerous journey from Libya to Europe, they had reached international waters when the supply ship rescued them and its captain opted to take them not to a port of safety in Europe, as required by law, but back to a gulag of migrant detention facilities in Libya where the United Nations and others have documented systematic torture, rape, extortion, forced labour and death.

In October this year, the captain of that supply ship, Giuseppe Sotgiu, paid a heavy price for his decision: an Italian judgesentencedhim to a year in prison for violating humanitarian law. The painful irony of this conviction is that Sotgiu is headed to jail for what EU officials have been doing on a far grander scale for several years: pushing migrants back to a place of extreme human rights abuses.









Since at least 2017, the European Union, led by Italy, has trained and equipped the Libyan Coast Guard to serve as a proxy maritime force, whose central purpose is to stop migrants from reaching European shores. It is highly effective in this mission thanks to aerial intelligence provided by the EU border agency, Frontex.

Flying drones and aeroplanes over the Mediterranean, Frontex locates migrant rafts, then alerts the Italians, who, in turn, inform the Libyan authorities. Once captured by the Libyan Coast Guard, these migrants are then delivered into a dozen or so detention centres run by militias.

For the EU and for the ship captains working the Mediterranean, the challenge of how best to handle desperate migrants fleeing hardships in their native countries is only going to grow more pronounced. Climate change is expected to displace216 million peopleacross the globe by 2050. Rising seas, desertification, famine, etc will drive the desperate to places like Europe and the United States, testing the moral character and political imagination of countries better prepared to survive an overheated planet.

And the big players in that global drama, the men and women working commercial ships in the Mediterranean, will find themselves ever more frequently in an impossible bind. Those captains who, unlike Sotgiu, abide by humanitarian law and decide to bring the migrants to Europe also can face dire consequences.

In August 2020, for instance, the crew of a Danish-flagged oil tanker called the Maersk Etiennerescued 27 migrants, including a pregnant woman and a child, at the request of Maltese authorities. Malta then denied the Maersk ship entry to its port to offload the migrants, leading to a long and costly standoff that ended only after the migrants were handed over to a humanitarian NGO.

Italian prosecutors later alleged that Maersk had paid the NGO more than $100,000 to take the migrants in a possible violation of immigration laws. Maersk called the payment a donation meant to help the NGO cover the costs of assisting the migrants.

But many migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean never make it onto merchant ships because they are instead caught by the Libyan Coast Guard. Despite its deadly track record of dealing with migrants and its extensive links with militias, the Libyan Coast Guard, continues to draw strong EU support. For example, in 2020, the EU supplied its fleet with four new speed boats so that it could more effectively capture migrants and send them to the same detention centres that the UN has described as being involved in state-sponsored crimes against humanity.

During a reporting trip to Libya, earlier this year, I caught a glimpse of the horrors that migrants go through in these facilities. Even though the EU routinely denies financing the abuse of migrants in Libya, an investigation by The Outlaw Ocean Project, my non-profit news organisation in Washington, DC, found evidence to the contrary. In fact, funds from the EU and member states, sometimes routed through aid organisations, pay for most of what happens to migrants sent through the brutal detention system in this failed state.

This money bought the shipping containers that double as port offices for the Libyan Coast Guard staff, and the touchscreen tablets used by aid workers who count the migrants as they disembark in Tripoli. It pays for many of the buses used to transport the migrants from the port to the detention centres, and the blankets, winter clothes, and slippers they often receive upon arrival.







The bathrooms at some of the detention centres, as well as the showers, toilets, soap, hygiene kits, toilet paper were bought with EU funds. The same goes for the mattresses where the detained migrants sleep. EU money paid for the 4x4s used by Libyan migration authorities to look for migrants if they escape detention or as they enter Libya in the south through the Saharan desert.

When migrants in detention get sick, often the ambulances that take them to the hospital were bought by the EU. And when migrants die – washing up ashore or in detention – EU money often pays for the body bags and for the training of Libyan personnel on how to handle the corpses in a religiously respectful fashion. Much of this funding is well-intentioned, even life-saving. But it is beyond denial that the EU and its member states financially sustain the system in Libya by which thousands of migrants are being captured and held in ghastly conditions with impunity.

In Tripoli, Iinvestigatedthe death of one migrant, Aliou Candé from Guinea Bissau, who died in the notorious detention centre Al-Mabani. In September 2019, Candé had set off from his home village of Sintchan Demba Gaira, where climate change had brought longer droughts and unexpected flooding, devastating his crops and leaving his family hungry.

After a months-long journey, he had arrived in Libya, hoping to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. He finally got on a boat in February this year, but the Libyan Coast Guard caught the vessel and transferred the migrants to Al-Mabani.

In April, Candé was killed when guards opened fire on migrants in his cell who had tried to break free. He was buried in an overcrowded migrant cemetery in Tripoli.

I interviewed dozens of migrants who had been imprisoned with Candé at Al-Mabani. They told me of cells so crowded the detainees had to sleep in shifts. They spoke of a special room where migrants were sometimes beaten while hung upside down from ceiling beams. They shared with me the audio message that Candé recorded on a mobile phone secreted into the jail where he made a final plea to his family to send the ransom he needed to be set free.

No one was punished for Candé’s death. EU officials called for an investigation, but then went silent. It all felt like yet another example of the impunity with which Libyan officials deal with some of the world’s most vulnerable people.

And then I got my own taste of Libyan impunity. A week into my reporting on Candé’s killing, I was abducted from my hotel room and held for almost a week by Libya’s intelligence service, linked to a militia called Al-Nawasi Brigade. I was blindfolded, beaten and made to sign a “confession” written in Arabic. My crime? Reporting on migrants.

There is some recent hope that some accountability for the EU and its Libyan partners might be approaching. The conviction of the ship captain in October points to a growing discomfort with the illegality of delivering migrants back to Libya. So, too, do two landmark cases brought this year by migrants against Frontex before the European Court of Justice, the EU’s chief judicial authority. The cases allege Frontex’s agents and officials either ignored evidence of rights abuses perpetrated by EU member states or themselves participated in the illegal turning back of migrants seeking asylum.

Of course, the EU is not alone in trying to outsource the dirty work of containing migration. For the past decade, the US government has sought to reduce the flow of migrants by requiring those coming through Central America tostay in Mexicowhile applying for resettlement. So-called “remote vetting” also enables US immigration authorities to avoid the quandary of what to do with people whose asylum applications were denied but who come from places that lack deportation agreements.

People who stay in migrant centres in Mexico face inadequate access to food and clean water, extreme temperatures, overcrowding, disease and beatings by guards, according to The Global Detention Project, a human rights NGO based in Geneva.

Countries surely have a right and a duty to manage their borders, but the way the US and the EU are handling migrants is neither effective nor humane. Putting ship captains in the middle of this crisis is hardly the solution. Worse still is outsourcing the problem to failed states like Libya where human rights abuses are a foregone conclusion.

Climate change,‘Climate diplomacy’: Can smog bring India and Pakistan together?,"Islamabad, Pakistan– Relations between nuclear-armed neighbours Pakistan and India have largely remained tense and stagnant for years. Now, an unlikely catalyst is promising to facilitate dialogue between them: deadly smog that is enveloping key cities in both countries.

A senior government official from Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, which borders Indian Punjab, revealed that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has shown an interest in visiting her Indian counterpart to address the pressing issue of air pollution. Both Lahore and India’s capital New Delhi haverecently rankedamong the world’s most polluted cities.

“Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz will be sending a letter to Indian Punjab’s Chief Minister [Bhagwant Singh Mann] in the coming days. She has expressed her willingness to visit India and extend an invitation for him to visit Pakistan,” Raja Jahangir Anwar, Punjab’s secretary for environment and climate change, told Al Jazeera.

Anwar added that, given the adverse climatic conditions affecting the region, Pakistan is also considering hosting a regional climate conference in Lahore before the year ends.

“We recognise that these matters fall under external affairs, requiring approval from the federal government and relevant stakeholders, but this situation is urgent,” he emphasised. “If this can bring Pakistan and India together, along with other countries, why waste this opportunity?”

Since September, falling temperatures, changing atmospheric conditions and domestic emissions have severely affected Lahore and New Delhi, with air quality indices (AQI) frequently surpassing 300 micrograms of PM2.5 – fine particulate matter measuring 2.5 microns or smaller. That is far above the limit of 100 micrograms of PM2.5 that is considered acceptable.

The PM2.5 particles are released from both human activities and natural events and pose serious health risks, as they can penetrate deep into human respiratory systems.

With the ever-increasing air pollution levels, Nawaz, daughter of three-time former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and a proponent of normalising relations with India, has in recent days reiterated her commitment to pursuing “climate diplomacy”.

Speaking at a Diwali event in Lahore on Wednesday, she emphasised the need for both nations to collaborate on this issue.

“This matter has to be resolved diplomatically with India. I am considering writing a letter to Indian Punjab’s chief minister. This is not a political issue, it is a humanitarian one,” she said.

Nawaz further added that while her government is taking steps to address the crisis, reciprocal action from India is essential.

“Winds don’t know there is a line [border] in between. This has to be done for the betterment for Indian people and their wellbeing, as well as for Pakistan’s people too,” the chief minister said.

The plea for collaborating with India comes as Lahore has seen the presence of PM2.5 exceed even 700 micrograms in recent days. The government has announced imposing a “green lockdown” in Lahore, a city of 15 million people, banning various commercial and construction activities.

During the early hours of November 1, according to live data monitored and compiled by IQAir, a Swiss climate group, New Delhi was the most polluted city in the world with 585 micrograms of PM2.5 in its atmosphere, closely followed by Lahore, which recorded 240 micrograms of PM2.5.

Muhammad Farooq Alam, a deputy director at Pakistan Punjab’s Environmental Protection Agency, explained that the worsening air quality during autumn and winter results from various factors. Cold air is heavier than warmed air and sinks close to the surface of the Earth, along with the particles it carries.

“As temperatures decrease after September, emissions from both human activities and natural events become concentrated within a dispersion area of one to two kilometres in the atmosphere, compared to over 12 to 15 kilometres during the summer,” he told Al Jazeera. “It feels like living and breathing in a small, locked room with no ventilation.”

Alam said sources of the pollution included industrial emissions, vehicular traffic, residential and commercial outputs – and stubble burning, a controversial practice in which farmers burn the remnants of existing crops to clear the ground in order to sow a new crop for the upcoming season.

Last year, during the smog season, farmers in both countries were criticised for burning crop stubble, exacerbating air pollution.

“Among various mitigation strategies, we have discussed controlling vehicular traffic, but the financial costs, which could reach billions, pose a significant challenge. The magnitude of the problem is enormous,” he said.

Anwar, the provincial secretary, urged a shift away from blaming individual countries and called for raising awareness about the weather phenomena contributing to this issue.

He added that while agricultural practices are similar in both countries, India’s larger size results in a higher volume of crop stubble burning.

“Weather patterns indicate the onset of an eastern wind corridor, which will carry pollutants toward Pakistan, likely causing Lahore’s AQI to rise again by Sunday or Monday,” he said.

Dawar Hameed Butt, co-director of the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI), a climate research and advocacy group, said that the chief minister’s suggestion to engage with her Indian counterpart necessitates a transboundary pollution management approach.

“The Male Declaration among South Asian countries aimed to develop such an approach but was unsuccessful. Recent efforts to revive it are under way, but the specifics remain uncertain,” he explained.

The Male Declaration, signed in 1998, is the only existing intergovernmental framework in South Asia addressing air pollution and includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

According to an IQAir report released in April 2023, South Asia remains the most severely affected region in the world for air pollution.

While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that average annual PM2.5 levels should not exceed five micrograms per cubic metre, last year saw Bangladesh, Pakistan and India among the countries with the worst air quality indices.

Bangladesh recorded an alarming 79.9 micrograms, nearly 16 times higher than the WHO recommendation, while Pakistan scored 73.7 and India recorded 54.4 micrograms.

The Lancet, the United Kingdom-based medical journal, in a recent report estimated that 1.6 million people in India died in 2021 due to air pollution.

Butt asserts that ultimately, the solutions are clear – even if not necessarily easy to implement for developing countries. “Both sides must transition to cleaner energy sources across all sectors and implement effective management of crop waste, which requires significant investment and a major shift in public behaviour,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/climate-diplomacy-can-smog-bring-india-and-pakistan-together
Climate change,What makes South Asia so vulnerable to climate change?,"Heavy monsoon rains in Pakistan over the past weekkilled at least 50 peopleacross the country, nearly a year after massive flooding killed more than 1,700 people and affected 33 million others.

In neighbouring India, about a dozen districts in the northeastern state of Assam were hit by deadly flash floods in June, forcing thousands to flee their homes and seek refuge at makeshift relief camps.

The ravaging floods – which killed at least 11 people – meant many faced the daunting task ofrebuilding their livesas they returned to destroyed homes and drowned livestock.

Climate-change-induced downpours, drought, and soaring temperatures have become increasingly common across the eight countries of South Asia, making it one of the world’s most vulnerable regions to the impacts of global warming.

Saleemul Haq, director at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said the region is particularly at risk because of a combination of geography, population and poverty.

“Over abillion and a half peopleare living in an area that is not such a big part of the world. It has major river systems from the Hindu Kush and the Himalayan mountain regions flowing through,” he told Al Jazeera.

Some750 million peoplein South Asia have been affected by at least one natural disaster, according to data compiled by the Washington-based World Bank.

The lack of land to grow food, water shortages, and displacement of populations are some of the challenges the region is facing as climate experts predict irreversible consequences to the livelihoods of hundreds of millions.



For thousands of years, South Asia was seen as the world’s “granary” for agriculture – a region with weather patterns well-suited for growing crops, Pakistan-based climate scientist Fahad Saeed told Al Jazeera.

“However, with the onset of climate change, the delicate balance which was important for crops to grow has been disturbed,” Saeed said.

Results from a studypublished in 2021on wheat production up to 2050, using crop simulation models, found the most negative effects will be seen in South Asian nations with a yield decline of 16 percent.

Environmentalist Anjal Prakash said climate change will have “significant implications” for food security in South Asia.

“Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and storms … pose substantial challenges to agricultural systems in the region,” said Prakash, adding livestock productivity and fisheries will be adversely affected.

Furthermore, Prakash said climate change could also make water availability of a significant issue in the region, which has one of the highest number of glaciers in the world, situated in the Himalayas.

“Melting glaciers and changes in rainfall patterns can disrupt irrigation systems, affecting crop growth and exacerbating water scarcity,” Prakash, who has previously worked with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, asserted.

A University of Leedsstudy published in 2021found the ice from glaciers in the Himalayas is melting “at least 10 times higher than the average rate over past centuries”, a result of human-induced climate change.

Researchers said the Himalayas, which cover countries such as Pakistan, Nepal and India, had lost 40 percent of their ice over several hundred years.

Water scarcity and low crop yields will result in adding to the continuing hunger crisis in the region, climate experts said.

In 2021, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FOA) said some 21 percent of people in South Asia facedsevere food insecurity, a 2 percent rise from 2020. In the same year, the region had the highest number of undernourished people in the world – 330 million – the FOA said.

Fears of declines in food production, together with other climate-related calamities such as rising sea levels, have also raised the alarm as millions in South Asia are being internally displaced.

Areport publishedby activist group ActionAid in 2020 estimated the region could see up to 63 million people become migrants by 2050 as a result of extreme weather events.

Huq said displacement from human-induced climate change was further adding to economic migration from rural to urban areas – a continuing phenomenon worldwide – with South Asia being a major “hotspot”, with the greatest displacement taking place in low-lying coastal areas.

“Climate change … is exacerbating the ‘push factor’ – the motivation to migrate away from place of residence – for people who are living in places where they can no longer continue to have livelihoods that they used to have, whether it’s farming or fishing,” he said.

“From the damage that occurs to infrastructure, agricultural land and homes, many people that evacuate aren’t able to go home again. They become effectively refugees.”

In Bangladesh, Huq said an estimated 2,000 people were moving to the capital Dhaka, many displaced by the effects of extreme weather from lowland coastal districts such as Barisal and Satkhira.

“Dhaka is one of thefastest-growing megacitiesin the world. Absorbing many millions – possibly in the region of 10 million new climate migrants over the next decade – is just going to be impossible. Facilities are inadequate for the existing population. They’re going to be even more inadequate for the additional population,” said Huq.

Climate scientists also warned that extreme weather patterns are aggravating the dire health conditions in some of the world’s poorest regions, with South Asia being no exception.

Physician and climate analyst K Srinath Reddy of the Public Health Foundation of India said heavy rainfall and floods are a precursor for a myriad of vector-borne diseases.

“Malaria, chikungunya, dengue fever are already present as health challenges in South Asia, but they’re going to markedly increase because of several factors such as rising temperatures,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Mosquitoes can breed in warmer areas which have now opened up. In fact, as humans are wilting in the heat, mosquitoes become athletic and can rise to higher heights and so can spread farther and faster. You will find even hilly areas which were previously not malaria prone now much more malaria prone at higher altitudes.”

Meanwhile, the increased intensity of heatwaves in South Asia has been linked to illnesses, including cardiovascular and respiratory disease, Reddy said.

According to a study by the World Weather Attribution, deadly heatwaves in India and Bangladesh in mid-April were made 30 times more likely because of climate change.

A study published by Lancet in October showed India had seen a55 percent risein fatalities from extreme heat in the periods between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021.

Rais Akhtar, a climate expert and former national fellow at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the dire state of health facilities in South Asia would make it easier for extreme weather to affect human health, especially in rural areas where most people live.

“In countries like Bangladesh and India, there is a dualism of sorts where in certain cities, there are well-established healthcare facilities. But in the rural, underdeveloped areas, these facilities are severely lacking … including shortage of doctors,” he told Al Jazeera.

People must travel to major cities to receive treatment, a costly ordeal for many.

Saeed, associated with German think tank Climate Analytics, noted in addition to weak health infrastructure in South Asia, governments do not possess the response and rescue capacity to provide adequate relief whenclimate-related calamities strike.

“The devastation from last year’s floods were so huge … affecting around 33 million people … that government authorities such the National Disaster Management Authority and hospitals were caught on their heels,” he said.

Moreover, the catastrophic floods also directlyaffected numerous health facilitiesacross Pakistan, with the World Health Organization reporting more than 1,400 hospitals were destroyed or damaged, leaving thousands without access to medical care.

Climate change,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.

Al Jazeera is an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government.
