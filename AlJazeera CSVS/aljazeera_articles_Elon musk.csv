Elon musk,Trump ally Elon Musk calls to ‘delete’ US consumer protection bureau,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has expressed support for binning a federal agency in the United States designed to protect consumers from predatory financial practices.

In an early-morning message on his social media platform X, Musk called for an end to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an independent watchdog agency with oversight over banks and other financial institutions.

“Delete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies,” Musk wrote on Wednesday.

Musk isset to advisethe administration of President-elect Donald Trump in the new year, in a newly created role to slash government bureaucracy.

Trumpannouncedhis plans for theDepartment of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, on November 13, with Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy at its head.

On social media, the president-elect described the department as a commission that would “provide advice and guidance from outside of Government” to “restructure Federal Agencies”.







Musk, an entrepreneur known for the rocket company SpaceX and the electric car business Tesla, has already started to name federal agencies he feels should come on thechopping block.

Also on Wednesday, heposteda poll on X asking viewers to weigh in on what should happen to the budget for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the agency responsible for collecting federal taxes.

The most popular result was to have its budget “deleted”.

Musk laterrespondedaffirmatively to a commenter who called for the Department of Government Efficiency to audit the IRS: “Gonna happen.”

Musk’scommentabout the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, however, is one of the most direct signals yet that the agency could come under attack during Trump’s second term.

Founded in July 2011, the bureau was a reaction to the 2007 financial crisis, which was sparked by predatory lending in the US housing market. The result was a “great recession” that saw economic losses across the world.

To prevent a similar crisis from happening again, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act to overhaul the financial regulatory system. New agencies were tasked with monitoring and maintaining the health of the US financial system.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in particular, was established to gather consumer complaints and investigate “unfair, deceptive or abusive” practices.

As of May, the bureaureportsthat its work has resulted in over $20.7bn in compensation, cancelled debt and other forms of monetary relief for the US public.

It also states it has requested responses from companies for more than 5.6 million consumer complaints.







Still, the bureau has repeatedly come under attack from Republicans, who accuse it of overstepping in its mission.

For example, Project 2025 – a policy document from the Heritage Foundation think tank, designed as a blueprint for a right-wing presidency –calledfor the bureau to be abolished outright.

“The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the document says. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency.”

Musk’s comments on Wednesday about the CFPB came in response to complaints from Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley businessman who claimed the bureau had “terrorised” financial institutions for political reasons.

Elon musk,Do Elon Musk and DOGE have power to close US government agencies?,"The Department of Government Efficiency – the Trump administration’s cost-cutting agency, headed by billionaire business owner Elon Musk – has put hundreds of federal officials on leave, gained access to sensitive federal payment systems and led the charge to shutter federal agencies.

The pushback againstDOGE, as it is called, has been swift, as legislators and the public ask whether Musk can downsize, restructure or eliminate agencies authorised and funded by Congress.









Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for New York, wrote on X on February 3: “An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government. DOGE is not a real government agency. DOGE has no authority to make spending decisions. DOGE has no authority to shut programs down or to ignore federal law. DOGE’s conduct cannot be allowed to stand.”

— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer)February 3, 2025



At a news conference the following day, Schumer said the idea that DOGE is acting unlawfully “is not debatable. It is an indisputable fact.”

Officially, courts will decide whether that’s indisputable or not.

Because that hasn’t happened yet, we asked the White House what constitutional or statutory authority DOGE is operating under. The White House, in a statement, cited neither specific laws nor constitutional provisions. It said: “Those leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.”

Here, we take a closer look at Schumer’s statements about DOGE and its status and authority within the United States government.

Legal scholars and government operations experts said they see little in the Constitution or US law to support the executive branch acting alone to overturn what Congress has authorised and funded.

“This is a question that has a very clear answer: Congress and Congress alone has the authority to enact appropriations measures,” said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor. “The president does not have unilateral authority to shut down an expenditure, or instrumentalities funded by Congress, without the authorisation of Congress.”

DOGE isn’t a conventional government agency; those are typically created by Congress with a mission and a fixed amount of funding. By contrast, DOGE’s budget and staffing are largely a mystery.

The Trump administration established it byexecutive orderon January 20, 2025.

The order said an administrator who reports to the White House chief of staff would head DOGE and that its operations would cease on July 4, 2026. The order also establishes “DOGE teams” of at least four people within each federal agency.

The White House has said Musk is a “special government employee”, a decades-old government category for someone who works 130 days or fewer during a year. Special government employees may be paid or unpaid – it’s unclear which of those categories Musk falls into – and must provide financial disclosures and abide by ethics rules, including not involving themselves in matters in which they have financial interests (Musk’s companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have received at least $15.4bn in government contracts over the past decade, The New York Times reported.)







Legal experts we interviewed were dubious that it’s legal for DOGE to cut spending already appropriated by Congress and signed by the president.

One key obstacle to DOGE is the Constitution, specifically Article 1, which establishes Congress and empowers the legislative branch to appropriate funds. “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law,” it says.

Beyond this, Congress has enacted, and presidents have signed, laws to reaffirm this principle. The 1974 Impoundment Control Act set up a detailed process for what a president could and could not do when disagreeing over whether to spend money that Congress had approved.

That law says if the executive branch wants to cancel spending, it must propose a cut, known as a “rescission”. Spending cannot be paused for more than 45 days as legislators consider the cuts.

There are “major issues with impounding funds that have been authorised and appropriated if they do not follow the Impoundment Control Act”, said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and formerly a longtime Republican Senate aide.

The Supreme Court in recent years has blocked the executive branch from overstepping its congressionally authorised authority, such as with President Joe Biden’sbid to forgive student loan debt.

“If Congress told a department or agency they could regulate, they can,” said Stetson University law professor Louis J Virelli III. “If Congress didn’t, then they can’t.”

Typically, the Office of Management and Budget and the Justice Department evaluate executive orders, following a procedure President John F Kennedy laid out in an executive order, said Steven Smith, an Arizona State University political scientist. “That process provides a review of proposed executive orders that includes their constitutionality and legality,” Smith said. But given the speed of Trump’s order about DOGE, which was signed the day he was sworn in, and the personnel flux within the federal government, Smith said he’s seen no sign that Trump has followed this longstanding, deliberative process.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has claimed both the right to impound funds – that is, to refuse to spend congressionally approved money – and its reverse, legal experts said. By offeringbuyouts to millions of federal employees, with those who accept getting paid until September 30, the administration has pledged to pay money Congress hasn’t yet appropriated. Current federal funding runs out on March 14, but to promise a payment beyond that, “when there’s no legal basis, is illegal”, Virelli said.







Legal experts also believe the same legal justification – the Constitution’s assignment of the power of the purse to Congress, and subsequent laws – would prevent DOGE from shuttering entire agencies.

Under existing laws, such as the Impoundment Control Act, “there are certainly instances in which a president could stop particular payments for particular reasons or for short periods,” said Frank O Bowman III, a University of Missouri law professor. “But it is absolutely clear that a president cannot constitutionally, unilaterally shut down an entire congressionally created agency and all its programmes.” Trump and his appointees are working to remove the US Agency for International Development (USAID)’s independent status by folding the agency into the State Department and pledging to lay off most of its employees, and Trump promised during his campaign to shutter the Education Department.

“The least sinister version of what the administration is doing is, ‘Let’s play this out in the courts and see if we can get approval through the courts.’” Virelli said. “If this ends up as a series of lawsuits where the administration attempts to expand their powers and the court sorts all out, that’s not outside the bounds of our constitutional democracy.”

But Musk and DOGE may be moving so fast that the judicial branch would have difficulty stopping them even if judges wanted to, legal experts said.

The administration could win if lower courts “do not make decisions fast enough”, said Chris Edelson, an American University assistant professor of government. It could also win if judges decide to overrule longstanding precedent, he said. “A Supreme Court that says presidents are immune to criminal prosecution for ‘official acts’” – as the current courtdid in 2024– “may also decide that presidents don’t have to abide by other parts of the Constitution.”

Institutionally, Congress has the most to lose, experts agree. But it’s not helpless: Congress could pass a law blocking DOGE or at least some of its practices.

During President Richard Nixon’s Watergate scandal, as the Supreme Court moved strongly to constrain presidential power, “Congress backed the court up by moving to impeach him,” Edelson said. “I don’t see any evidence of the congressional Republican majorities doing that.”

For instance, Senator Thom Tillis, North Carolina, acknowledged that some of Musk’s actions could be unconstitutional, but “nobody should bellyache about that”, he told the news outlet NOTUS. “That runs afoul of the Constitution in the strictest sense … but it’s not uncommon for presidents to flex a little bit on where they can spend and where they can stop spending.”

David M Driesen, a Syracuse University law professor, said Tillis’s comparison is faulty.

“There is no precedent for withholding monies across the board because of broad policy disagreement with the law,” Driesen said. “That is a frontal attack on the legislative authority of Congress.”

If legislators don’t challenge DOGE, by passing new laws or going to court, they risk losing the powers Congress has held for two and a half centuries. Driesen and other legal experts said judges might consider the lack of congressional opposition as they decide cases on this question.

“That shouldn’t matter at all as a matter of constitutional law,” Bowman, the law professor, said. “But I suspect that for some judges, the silence might carry some weight.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/2/8/do-elon-musk-and-doge-have-power-to-close-us-government-agencies
Elon musk,US Election 2024,"When Donald Trump declared his “magnificent victory” as the results of the United States presidential election trickled in, he reserved special praise for one man who has helped to catapult him back into the nation’s top job.

“A star is born, Elon,” he said in a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, referring to his greatest ally in the race to become president: the billionaire owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), Elon Musk.

Musk has indeed played an outsized role in Trump’scomeback, not only pumping millions of dollars into Trump’s campaign but also serving as a policy advisor and promoter, effectively turning his X social media platform into a Make America Great Again (MAGA) mouthpiece.

“The future is gonna be fantastic,” Musk posted on X as it became apparent that Trump would be returning to the White House.

The future is gonna be fantasticpic.twitter.com/I46tFsHxs3

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)November 6, 2024



The billionaire’s star could indeed rise high under Trump, who previously suggested his ally could become “secretary of cost-cutting” in his cabinet. Experts have warned that Musk, whose Space X already wields clout as a major government defence contractor, could end up “regulating the regulators”.

As the dust settles, here’s everything you need to know about how the world’s richest man helped engineer one of the wildest political comebacks in history. How did Musk leverage his money and influence to get Trump back on top, and why?

To be clear, billionaires played a bigger role than ever in both the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Bill Gates of Microsoft and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg both backed Vice President Kamala Harris. But it was Musk’s multi-faceted support of Trump that really made the difference.

Musk donated an estimated $132m to Trump and other Republicans in the run-up to the 2024 election, according to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) last month in its final disclosures before election day.

Two of the biggest donations – $43.6m and $75m – went directly into the Trump campaign machine, notably the America PAC (political action committee) established by Musk himself.

Controversially, Musk launched a cashgiveawayin key swing states, offering registered voters who agreed to sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments of the US Constitution, which respectively protect freedom of speech and the right to keep and bear arms, the chance to win $1m a day.

“We are going to be awarding $1m randomly to people who have signed the petition, every day, from now until the election,” Musk said at a campaign event on October 19.

The move waschallengedin a Pennsylvania court after the US Justice Department warned the group could be breaking election laws, which forbid paying people to register to vote. However, judges ruled on Monday that the operation could go ahead after Musk’s lawyers argued that the winners were vetted spokespeople and not randomly chosen.

Now Musk is being sued in a class action suit by voters who claim he convinced them to sign the petition under false pretences that they had a chance of winning the $1m. The suit was filed on Tuesday by Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty, who also accused Musk of using the giveaway to collect valuable personal data and drive traffic to X.

FEC filings also showed Musk gave $10m to the Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC with a remit to “protect and expand the Republican Senate Majority”, potentially helping Republicans successfully wrest back control of the Senate in this election.

Musk has allegedly made other unreported donations to Republicans as well.

Strange though it may now seem, Elon Musk was once perceived as a liberal and a champion of renewable energy who claimed to have voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. This image has changed since 2022, following his takeover of the social media platform Twitter, now rebranded asX.

After pledging to turn Twitter into a “politically neutral” forum, Musk laid off employees responsible for monitoring disinformation. He also restored more than 62,000 suspended accounts, including white nationalist and neo-Nazi accounts accused of spreading hate speech and conspiracy theories.

Crucially, he also reversed the ban on Trump’s account, which the platform shut down after the attack on the US Capitol in January 2021, which many claim Trump encouraged.

By the time the election rolled around, critics said X had effectively become an unofficial house platform for the MAGA wing of the Republican Party. The owner himself was accused of “fanboying” Trump and spreading misinformation among his 200 million followers, his influence amplified by X’s algorithm.

One example was the promotion of a doctored video of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, which carried a fake voiceover saying: “I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire.” Musk reposted the video in July with the words, “this is amazing” and a laughing emoji, garnering 136 million more views for an item which was not flagged as a parody.

Misinformation about “illegal aliens” voting in the election circulated on X as well. This, despite studies from both conservative and left-leaning organisations showing that the incidence of the offence, carrying penalties of up to a year in prison, a fine and potential deportation, was negligible.

A conspiracy theory that Democrats were importing illegal immigrants and granting them an amnesty to broaden their voter base in future elections was also allowed to circulate on X and amplified by Musk himself. “Dem. America would then become a one-party, deep blue socialist state,” he said in a post in October.

The Dems have imported massive numbers of illegals to swing states. Triple digit increases over the past 4 years!

Their STATED plan is to give them citizenship as soon as possible, turning all swing states Dem.

America would then become a one-party, deep blue socialist state.https://t.co/zxVmmR0GqO

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)October 25, 2024



Following Trump’s televised debate against Harris in September, in which he repeated the false claim that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio town were eating cats and dogs, Musk reposted a meme of a cat holding a sign saying “Kamala hates me” with a laughing emoji.

Despite his avowed commitment to free speech, Musk hassuppressedsome news stories, such as an article by journalist Ken Klippenstein, which detailed Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance’s weak spots, reportedly obtained from leaked documents. While the journalist’s account was later reinstated, links to the article were blocked.

A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in March this year confirmed the growing popularity of the platform among Republican supporters, showing that 53 percent thought it was “good for democracy”, roughly triple the 17 percent who answered the same way in 2021.

A powerful merger of their fanbases supercharged the alliance between Trump and Musk.

Not so long ago, there was no love lost between the pair. In 2022, Trump called Musk a “bulls**t artist” for allegedly lying about supporting him in the 2016 election. Musk responded on then-Twitter, saying it was “time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset”.

Fast forward two years and the tech tycoon was side-by-side with Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wearing a black MAGA hat.

Musk’s lurch to the right is sometimes attributed to the government-imposed closure of his Tesla plants during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, he reopened a factory in Fremont, California, declaring that he was ready to be arrested, taking a stand against the “bureaucratic blob”.

His rightward shift has since become manifest in his relationships with anti-regulation leaders such as Argentinian President Javier Milei. Musk has also become close to international right-wing leaders such as Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, India’s Narendra Modi and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu.

However, a variety of American media outlets, such as Vanity Fair and the Washington Post, have pointed to a deeper motivation, sparked by one of his children’s decision to come out astransgenderin 2022, cutting ties with Musk and changing their surname to Wilson. Claiming in an interview with Jordan Peterson that he had been “tricked” into signing off on their medical treatment, Musk announced his crusade against the “woke mind virus”.

In 2021, Musk shifted Tesla’s headquarters from Palo Alto, California, in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, similarly changing his residence from California to Texas. In July this year, Musk said he wouldmove SpaceX and X from California to Texasover a law that bans schools from forcing teachers to notify parents when their child changes their gender identity.

Observers say Musk and Trump, who both present themselves as rule-breaking, non-mainstream “alpha males”, appear to have tapped into a widespread sense of male frustration in America, partly derived from the #MeToo movement and the feminist backlash against “toxic masculinity“, which has left some men saying they feel stigmatised and marginalised.

Writing in the New York Times last month, John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, called Trump’s play for the young male vote a “master class in bro whispering”. Angling for the “bro vote” appears to have paid off, with a recent Harvard Youth Poll revealing that 35 percent of men between 18 and 24 years old who were questioned voiced support for Trump, up five percent from a 2020 survey.

It is a sensibility that has found expression in so-called “bro” podcasts such as the Joe Rogan Experience. Rogan endorsed Trump on Monday after interviewing Musk. “The great and powerful @elonmusk. If it wasn’t for him, we’d be f**ked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way,” said Rogan on X.

The message clearly resonated.

Two days later, Trump was elected 47th president of the United States.

Elon musk,Elon Musk is a global problem,"From his apparent “Nazi salute”at United States President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration to his labelling of the US Agency for International Development as a “criminal organisation” that needs “to die” and the devastating austerity policies he excitedly pursues as the head of the newly minted “Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)”, multibillionaire X owner Elon Musk has undoubtedly become a destructive force in American politics.

But Musk’s narcissistic political ambitions are not limited by the borders of the United States. After helping Trump and his far-right MAGA movement assume control of the US, he has set his sights on replicating this success across the world.









The South African started his “world tour” of stirring far-right sentiments and attempting to install radical, Musk-friendly figures in positions of power in the United Kingdom.

Musk spent the past year periodically elevating British far-right voices, such as English Defence League co-founder Tommy Robinson and Reform Party leader Nigel Farage. In early January he once again tweeted “Free Tommy Robinson!” and shared a link to the UK far-right leader’s controversial documentary titled Silenced.

In the documentary, reportedlycommissionedby US far-right radio host Alex Jones’s InfoWars, Robinson falsely claims that Syrian refugee schoolboy Jamal Hijazi had violently attacked English schoolgirls and threatened to stab a boy at school.

Robinson had made the same claim a few years earlier in 2018 in a response to a viral video of Hijazi getting beaten at a school in Yorkshire. His response video on Facebook was viewed by more than a million people. Hijazi’s family faced death threats as a result.

Subsequently, Robinson – known to be funded by right-wing groups in the US – was smacked with alibel casefrom Hijazi, which he lost. He was ordered to pay Hijazi 100,000 pounds ($125,260) in damages, cover his legal costs to the tune of 500,000 pounds ($626,300) and was served with an injunction preventing him from publicly repeating his false claims about the Syrian schoolboy.

By making the documentary Silenced, in which he repeats his false claims about Hijazi, screening it for the public in London’s Trafalgar Square in July and widely sharing it online, Robinsonviolated the injunction. As a result, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison in October.

Of course, none of this features in Musk’s rants about Robinson.

Rather, he uses Robinson and the Hijazi case to peddle a wider far-right racial trope – namely that mass immigration from the non-West is a threat to women and girls in the West – and to try to influence domestic politics in the UK.

Musk knows well that this trope has recently gained currency in the UK.

Last summer, the UK was swept by violent anti-immigration protests and riots after a Welsh man of Rwandan descent stabbed and killed three girls at a dance class. However, the real trigger for the violence was not the crime itself but the misinformation spread by far-right groups and activists, including Robinson, that the suspect was a 17-year-old asylum seeker named “Al-Shakati”.

The decade-old “grooming gang scandal” related to the widespread abuse of white girls in several English towns and cities, such as Rochdale, Rotherham and Oldham, predominantly by British men of Pakistani origin, has also provided Musk and the British far right with opportunities to push tropes about race and immigration.

Since the scandal first became public, local agencies and security forces were accused of trying to cover it up to avoid being branded racist and Islamophobic.

A 2022 report into safeguarding measures in Oldham, a town at the centre of the scandal, eventually found that there was no cover-up despite “legitimate concerns” that the far right would capitalise on “the high-profile convictions of predominantly Pakistani offenders across the country”.

The truth and all its nuances, however, do not concern Musk. He decided the “cover-up” narrative serves his agenda and turns the wider public against immigrants, so he has continued to push it.

Recently, he has claimed that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who led the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) from 2008 to 2013, had failed to effectively deal with these “grooming gangs”. Hetweeted: “Starmer was complicit in the RAPE OF BRITAIN when he was head of Crown Prosecution for 6 years. Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain.” HecalledParliamentary Undersecretary of State for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls Jess Phillips “a rape genocide apologist”. Musk also published a series of posts calling onKing Charles IIIto dissolve the UK Parliament and order new elections.

Musk’s tweets and overt support for figures like Robinson may not trigger immediate change in the UK, but he is clearly setting the stage for the rise of the far right in the country – politically and economically.

Musk has also made a visit to Germany as part of his world tour of far-right agitation and support.

The tech mogul and DOGE leader has thrown his weight behind the country’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

In anopinion piecepublished in the conservative newspaper Welt am Sonntag in late December, Musk made his support for the far-right party public, calling the AfD the “last spark of hope” for Germany. He suggested the party’s commitment to restricting immigration would enable it to keep Germans safe and protect German culture. He wrote: “A nation must preserve its core values and cultural heritage in order to remain strong and united.”

In early January, Musk hosted alive conversationwith AfD leader Alice Weidel on X. On it he warned “only AfD can save Germany” from what he said was a migration-induced rise in crime and “wokeish liberal education system”, including “gender studies”, that supposedly plagues the country. For her part during the conversation, Weidel claimed Adolf Hitler was not a conservative or libertarian, rather, “he was this communist, socialist guy.” She also thanked Musk for the mainstream exposure, saying, “Elon, it’s a completely new situation for me that I can just have a normal conversation, and I’m not interrupted or negatively framed.”

In late January, Musk went on toaddressan AfD rally in Halle, Germany, via videolink. Speaking to the thousands in attendance, he once again declared that the far-right party was “the best hope for the future of Germany”. He added that the German people were “an ancient nation which goes back thousands of years” and AfD supporters needed to “fight, fight, fight” for the country’s future. In seeming reference to the AfD’sneo-Nazi links, Musk alsosaidGermany needs to “move beyond” feeling guilty for the Nazi crimes of the past and Germans must “be proud of German culture, German values”.

By publicly supporting the party and providing its leader with a platform to promote her extremist agenda without challenge, Musk is likely trying to help the AfD secure a Trump-style victory in Germany’s February 23 elections.

Trump is working to elevate the far right in several other countries.

He, for example, has struck up aclose bondwith the right-wing prime minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni. They share a mutual love of Lord of the Rings and xenophobia. He has called Meloni “even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside”. Meloni has called Musk “a genius” who has been unfairly portrayed as “a monster”. It wouldn’t be far-fetched to think that Musk had a hand in facilitating Meloni’s growing relationship with Trump.

Beyond Europe, Musk has been public about hisadmirationfor Argentinian President Javier Milei. Milei’s “chainsaw” austerity measures were an inspiration for DOGE. Milei was also present at Trump’s inauguration.

In September, Musk met with El Salvador’s “cool dictator” Nayib Bukele, who has made global news for his highly controversial “mano dura”, or “iron fist”, policies against gang violence and his mega-prisons. Now the Trump administration is reportedlyconsideringhousing its criminals “including those of US citizenship and legal residents” in Bukele’s lock-ups. Bukele hassaidhe is willing to help “outsource part of [the US] prison system” by housing convicted US criminals in his mega-prisons in “exchange for a fee”. He added: “The fee would be relatively low for the US but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.”

Meanwhile, Musk’s far-right influence has taken on a life of its own and started to have an impact even in countries he has not yet visited or said anything about.

He, for example, has said very little if anything at all about Polish politics. But a recentpollshows that close to 45 percent of Poles would vote for a candidate endorsed by the billionaire.

It is, of course, early days in Musk’s attempted global far-right revolution. Some of his moves may work, and others may not have the level of political impact he is hoping for. However, it is still a worry that Musk has been able to get as far as he has in terms of meddling in the internal politics of several countries. One can only hope that there will soon be a concerted pushback to Musk’s global moves.

Elon musk,Elon Musk at Trump’s inauguration: What’s the history of the Nazi salute?,"Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk’shand gestureduring a speech on United States President Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day has drawn widespread criticism and comparisons to a Nazi salute.

The owner of X and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla appeared at arally for Trump’s supporterson Monday at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC.

“This was no ordinary victory. This was a fork in the road of human civilisation,” Musk said during his speech.

“This one really mattered. Thank you for making it happen! Thank you,” he said.

Musk then touched the left side of his chest with his right hand and extended his arm upward, repeating the motion to the crowd behind him.

“My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilisation is assured,” he said as he finished the gesture.

Many took to social media to condemn the action, describing it as reminiscent of a Nazi salute used by supporters of German dictator Adolf Hitler.

Musk slammed the criticism and wrote on X that “the ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.”

Here’s what we know about the salute, its history and why Musk’s gesture has sparked controversy:







Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and fascism at New York University, wrote on X that the gesture was a “Nazi salute – and a very belligerent one too”.

But the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which tracks anti-Semitism, disagreed with claims that Musk had performed a Nazi salute and instead said the tech mogul had made an “awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm”.

Aaron Astor, a history professor at Maryville College in Tennessee, supported the ADL’s position and said on X that it was “not a Nazi salute”.

“This is a socially awkward autistic man’s wave to the crowd where he says ‘my heart goes out to you,'” he added.

I have criticized Elon Musk many times for letting neo-Nazis pollute this platform. But this gesture is not a Nazi salute. This is a socially awkward autistic man's wave to the crowd where he says ""my heart goes out to you.""https://t.co/QWWiYHEI65

— Aaron Astor (@AstorAaron)January 20, 2025



However, Musk’s actions appear to have enthused neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups.

Rolling Stone magazine wrote that Christopher Pohlhaus, leader of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, posted the video of Musk making the gesture on Telegram with the caption: “I don’t care if this was a mistake. I’m going to enjoy the tears over it.”

The Nazi salute, also known as the Heil Hitler salute, consisting of an outstretched right arm with the palm down, was used as an official greeting in Nazi Germany.

But the gesture dates back to a salute that is said to have been used in ancient Rome.

Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, who aimed to restore the country to imperial Rome, adopted the gesture in 1925.

By 1926, the gesture was being used by members of the Nazi party in Germany, and its use was made compulsory within the party.

In 1892, American Christian minister Francis Bellamy wrote the US Pledge of Allegiance to boost patriotism.

As the pledge quickly became popular, a magazine called the Youth Companion, where Bellamy worked, decided to create a salute to go with the words.

Named the Bellamy salute, it consisted of a straight right arm angled slightly upward and a faced-down palm.

The salute continued to be used across the US with no controversy until World War II when the US entered the war against the axis powers, including Germany and Italy.

With discomfort growing in the US that the Bellamy salute could be misinterpreted as pledging allegiance to Hitler and Mussolini, the US Congress amended the Flag Code in December 1942, changing the salute to placing a right hand over the heart.

Shortly after World War II, Germany banned the salute and any displays of Nazi insignia, which are punishable by three years in prison.

Austria also passed laws against the Nazi party and insignia shortly after the war.

In January 2024, Australia banned the Nazi salute, Nazi swastika and double lightning bolt insignia associated with the Schutzstaffel (SS) paramilitary group under Hitler.

In Canada, France and Switzerland, Nazi gestures can be considered hate speech.

However, in the US, salutes are not banned due to the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and gives significant protections to hate speech.

Musk in the past has been accused of being soft on anti-Semitism.

In 2023, Musk endorsed a post on X that accused Jews of hating white people, describing that claim as the “actual truth”.

The ADL slammed Musk’s post, calling it “profoundly disturbing” that Musk engaged with a “highly toxic, antisemitic campaign on his platform”.

Musk later stated that he and X were opposed to all forms of anti-Semitism.

However, in recent months, Musk has backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in February’s general election. In May, AfD leader Bjorn Hocke was fined for saying, “Everything for Germany!” in a speech in 2021, a slogan used by Nazi paramilitary forces and now banned in the country.

Musk has also backed the British far-right, anti-immigration party Reform UK. Before the United Kingdom’s general election in July, a Reform UK candidate came under fire after he claimed that the country would have been “far better” if it had taken Hitler’s “offer of neutrality” and not got involved in World War II.

Musk is also close friends with right-wing Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who was once a youth leader of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/21/elon-musk-at-trumps-inauguration-whats-the-history-of-the-nazi-salute
Elon musk,US Election 2024,"Billionaire Elon Musk haspledgedto award $1m every day until election day in the United States on November 5 to randomly selected registered voters who sign a petition to “support the constitution” launched by his pro-Donald Trump America Political Action Committee (PAC).

Musk announced the giveaway on Saturday at an America PAC-hosted rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

The scheme has come under scrutiny by legal experts as well as Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, who on Sunday asked law enforcement to launch an investigation into potential election interference.

Here is more about Musk’s giveaway:

From October 17 to November 5, Musk said he will give $1m to a randomly selected winner each day if:

Musk, 53 – who is a founder and the CEO of the electric car company Tesla and rocket producer SpaceX and owns the social media network X – has a net worth of $274.4bn, according to the Forbes real-time billionaires list.

Musk has repeatedly called the petition one that “upholds the US Constitution”.

More precisely, the petition on a webpage belonging to the America PAC website, says: “The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments.”

The webpage states, “EARN 1,000,000” in big, bold letters, flanked by two money bag emojis. Individuals who sign are supposed to enter their first name, last name, email address and cellphone number.

Next to the cellphone number field in the form, a note says the number is required only to confirm that the petition signee is a legitimate voter and “no other purpose”.

“Our goal is to get 1 million registered voters in swing states to sign in support of the constitution,” the website added.

On Friday, the day before the giveaway announcement, the Reuters news agency reported that Alysia McMillan, who canvassed for America PAC in Wisconsin, said field organisers had reported they were missing their daily goals in terms of enlisting voters and were expecting to fall short of their ultimate goal of contacting 450,000 voters by election day.

In Pennsylvania, each registered voter who signs the petition will automatically receive $100 as compensation, and an additional $100 is paid for each person who signs upon their referral. In other swing states, individuals will get $47 per successful referral.

The date the petition was created and the number of signatures amassed so far were not visible on the America PAC webpage.

PACs raise and spend money to advocate for or against a candidate in an election. Musk formed America PAC in May to support former President Trump’s election bid this year. On October 16, it was reported that Musk had poured$75m over three monthsinto America PAC.

Originally from South Africa, Musk obtained US citizenship in 2002. For years, he voted for Democratic Party candidates.

However, the relationship between Musk and the Democrats has soured during President Joe Biden’s time in office. Musk did not immediately become a Trump supporter. Instead, he threw his weight behind one of Trump’s competitors for the Republican presidential nomination,Ron DeSantis, in 2022.

Trump has a vacillating history with X, formerly known as Twitter. His tweets made the news regularly leading up to his first campaign for president in 2016, which he won. He was banned from X on January 8, 2021, two days after the USCapitol was attackedby Trump supporters over the results of the 2020 election, which Biden won.

However, Musk bought Twitter in October 2022. The next month, Trump’s account was reinstated.

Musk posted a supportive message of Trump on X, stating: “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” after anassassination attemptduring a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.

Muskattended a Trump rallyon October 5, wearing a black cap saying,“Make America Great Again” (MAGA), which is Trump’s campaign slogan.

Musk said the reason he is giving away the money is to generate more awareness about the America PAC petition.

“The legacy media won’t report on it. Not everyone’s on X,” he said in a video of the Harrisburg rally posted on the X account of America PAC. “I think this news is going to really fly.”

“You don’t even have to vote, you just have to sign a petition,” Musk said in another video posted on the same account.

Making a payment to someone “for registering to vote or for voting” is a federal crime, according to a document published by the US Department of Justice in December 2017. It adds that this payment does not have to be money but can also be other valuables like liquor or lottery tickets.

Brendan Fischer, a campaign finance lawyer, told The Associated Press that Musk’s giveaway approaches a legal boundary. That’s because the PAC is requiring registration as a prerequisite to become eligible for the $1m prize.

“There would be few doubts about the legality if every Pennsylvania-based petition signer were eligible, but conditioning the payments on registration arguably violates the law,” Fischer told the news agency.

“It’s not quite the same as paying someone to vote, but you’re getting close enough that we worry about its legality,” Michael Kang, an election law professor at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law, told AP.

“Though maybe some of the other things Musk was doing were of murky legality, this one is clearly illegal,” Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California in Los Angeles, wrote in a blog post on Saturday.

In an interview with the NBC television network’s Meet the Press programme on Sunday, Shapiro said Musk’s plan was “deeply concerning” and something that law enforcement should look into.

“Musk obviously has a right to be able to express his views. He’s made it very, very clear that he supports Donald Trump. I don’t. Obviously, we have a difference of opinion,” Shapiro said on Meet the Press.

“I don’t deny him that, right, but when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions,” he added.

Since the tech billionaire’s announcement, Musk’s plan has already seen two recipients.

On Saturday, Musk announced the first winner moments after he announced the plan at the rally.

The winner, a red MAGA hat-clad man named John Dreher scampered through a roaring crowd towards the stage, his fists pumping the air.

“By the way, John had no idea,” Musk announced, handing an elated Dreher a cheque as a US flag appeared on a screen behind them.

On Sunday, Musk announced the second $1m winner, a woman named Kristine Fishell. Fishell donned a red shirt with a slogan for Trump and his running mate,JD Vance, and cupped her hands around her face in disbelief.

Two $1 MILLION checks have gone out to voters for signing our petition to support the Constitution.

A registered swing state voter who signs the petition will be selected to earn $1M as a spokesperson for America PAC every day until Election Day.

Elon musk,"Elon Musk tightens grip on gov’t, sparking ‘coup’ accusations","Billionaire Elon Musk is tightening his control over broad swaths of the United States government at extraordinary speed, prompting growing alarm from Democrats and constitutional scholars.

In the two weeks since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has upended the federal bureaucracy, prompting questions about the scope of his authority and warnings of a constitutional crisis, or even a coup.

Acting without oversight of the US Congress, Musk’s lieutenants have brought the work of theUS’s main foreign aid agencyto a halt, flagged millions of government employees for redundancy, gained access toclassified materialand sensitive details about millions of Americans, and taken control of the payment system that manages the flow of trillions of dollars of government spending.

Musk, who was named as a “special government employee” by the White House on Monday, does not hold elected office and is not part of Trump’s Cabinet, whose members require confirmation by the US Senate.

“I’ve never ever seen anything like this, never in the history of the country. We always have the president, Cabinet members and the Treasury secretary confirmed by the Senate,” Richard Painter, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer in the administration of former President George W Bush, told Al Jazeera.

“Cabinet members are installed by the president, they coordinate with the White House to implement policy. You can’t just not spend money appropriated by Congress.”







As the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk, the world’s richest man, has billions of dollars worth of government contracts, a fact that has raised concerns about conflicts of interest that could arise in his cost-cutting drive.

“Special government employees”, who are typically appointed on a temporary basis, are subject to “most” ethics rules that apply to ordinary government employees, “although sometimes in a less restrictive way”, according to a US Department of Justice summary.

Under the law, they are restricted from “participating in matters” that affect their financial interests and “may” be required to submit a financial disclosure report within 30 days of assuming a position, according to the summary.

Enforcing ethics rules against Musk is at the discretion of the Justice Department, which Trump has sought to purge of perceived enemies.

“Only the justice department can enforce this statute,” Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University who specialises in government ethics, told Al Jazeera.

“And it is reasonable to question whether Trump’s Justice Department will enforce the law against a Trump ally like Musk.”

On Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he hadtaken over as acting directorof the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which Musk had labelled a “criminal organisation”.

Hours later, Musk appeared to confirm reports that his task force had taken control of the US Treasury payments system, which manages the transfer of funds on behalf of the entire federal government.

“The only way to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer money is to follow the payment flows and pause suspicious transactions for review. Obviously,” Musk said in a post on social media platform X.

“Naturally, this causes those who have been aiding, abetting and receiving fraudulent payments very upset. Too bad.”

On Monday, a group of unions representing government workers filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, alleging that DOGE’s access to the payments system had unlawfully compromised the privacy of millions of Americans.

“Secretary Bessent’s action granting DOGE-affiliated individuals full, continuous, and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies, and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords,” said the complaint, filed by The Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees and the Service Employees International Union.

“And because Defendants’ actions and decisions are shrouded in secrecy, individuals will not have even basic information about what personal or financial information that Defendants are sharing with outside parties or how their information is being used.”

In a news conference, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said that the US was witnessing the “hostile takeover of the federal government” by an “unelected shadow government”.

New York House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused Musk of orchestrating a “plutocratic coup”.

“If you want the power, run for office and be chosen by the people,” Ocasio-Cortez said on X.

Michael J Gerhardt, a professor who specialises in constitutional law at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said that Musk’s influence over the government was undemocratic and possibly unconstitutional.

“This is perhaps the first time ever someone from outside the government has been so openly given free rein within,” Gerhardt told Al Jazeera.

“There is no mechanism for keeping Elon Musk in check.”

“He has whatever power Trump lets him have,” Gerhardt added. “Given his position, the only bounds on his authority is Trump himself.”

However, David Alvis, an associate professor of political science at Wofford College, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, disputed the suggestion that Musk’s actions should be seen as an illegitimate exercise of power.

“I think it would be better to think of it as an attempt to implement in practice what Reagan Republicanism had preached in theory for years.  It was Reagan who had promised to eliminate the Department of Education and Energy but did not,” Alvis told Al Jazeera.

“As presidents have increasingly relied on unilateral executive power to advance public policy, the Trump administration is relying on that same reservoir of power to undo most of the public policy entrenched at the administrative level over the past decades.”

Speaking to reporters at the Oval Office of the White House, Trump said that Musk “can’t” and “won’t” do anything without the approval of his administration.

“We will give him the approval where appropriate. Where not appropriate, we won’t. He reports in,” Trump said.

“Where we think there’s a conflict or a problem, we won’t let him go near it,” Trump added.

Gerhardt, the law professor, said that while the presence of “powers behind the throne” was not new in US politics, Musk’s influence over the government showed an unprecedented disregard for the law.

“There has been corruption associated with nearly every presidency in American history, but Musk is brazenly defying and disregarding the laws that govern how government functions,” Gerhardt said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/4/elon-musk-accused-of-coup-running-shadow-govt-as-doge-tightens-grip
Elon musk,Germany accuses Musk of election meddling over AfD support: What we know,"Germany’s government accused US billionaire Elon Musk on Monday of interfering in its upcoming February election after he threw his support behind the far-right party, Alternative for Germany (AfD) in X posts and an opinion piece published by the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.

German leaders accused Musk, who claimed that AfD is the only party which can “save” Germany, of trying to “influence the federal election” as the country heads towards snap elections amid political turmoil next month.

So what happened and what does it all mean?

Since 2013, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) has governed Germany, which is Europe’s largest economy, leading different coalition governments.

However, the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz of the SPD, lost a confidence vote in parliament on December 16.

The vote, tabled by Scholz himself apparently in a bid to trigger an early election, came after the collapse of the German governing coalition government headed by Scholz and SPD. The government was thrown into turmoil when Scholz firedFinance MinisterChristian Lindner in November following months of disagreements over Germany’s budget.

Analysts say Scholz fully expected to lose the vote but wanted to trigger earlier elections, which he sees as his party’s last chance to cling to any power. Before Monday’s vote, Scholz said an election would be an opportunity to set the country on a new course.

Following the vote of no confidence, the German parliament was dissolved by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of SPD on Friday, andsnap electionswere called for February 23, 2025, seven months before parliamentary elections were originally scheduled to take place.

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is considered to be a far-right populist party in Germany. It was founded in 2013 and was holding 76 seats out of the 733 seats in the German parliament, or Bundestag before dissolution.

AfD is a Eurosceptic party, which means it is critical of Germany’s integration into the European Union.

AfD is also openly critical of Islam and opposes mass immigration. The party opposed former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s welcoming stance towards immigrants arriving from the Middle East and Africa. In 2015, under Merkel’s leadership,more than 1 million refugeesarrived in Germany.

In September this year, AfDwon a key electionfor the eight Landtag seats of the eastern state of Thuringia with 32.8 percent of the vote, marking the first state election win for a far-right party since World War II.

The AfDnominated party leader Alice Weidelas its candidate for chancellor in early December. The nomination is largely symbolic since the party is unlikely to win a majority. Once the Bundestag is elected, it votes for the chancellor. To become chancellor, a candidate needs to receive votes from more than half of the parliament.

For the upcoming election, the latest polls place AfD in second place with support from 19 percent of the electorate as of December 28, according to Politico. In the first place, with 30 percent, is the conservative coalition comprising centre-right parties Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU).

The previous governing group, SPD, is in third place, with 17 percent support projected.

The mainstream parties have refused to work with AfD in government, but it is nevertheless projected to form the largest opposition in parliament following the upcoming elections.

On December 20, Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns: “Only the AfD can save Germany.”

Musk, who has become a close aide to US President-elect Donald Trump, expanded on his support for the AfD in an opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag, a German Sunday newspaper. The paper is published by the Axel Springer media group, which also owns US-based political site, Politico.

Musk’s article was published online on Sunday. Translated, it reads: “The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!”

He wrote that Germany is on “the brink of economic and cultural collapse” and “AfD can save Germany from becoming a shadow of its former self”.

Musk wrote that he had “significant investments” in Germany, which gave him the right to comment about the country.

Saying that Germany’s traditional parties have failed in Germany, Musk wrote, “The AfD, even though it is described as far-right, represents a political realism that resonates with many Germans who feel their concerns are ignored by the establishment.”

Musk has openly backed other far-right figures recently, including Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom’s Reform party and Italy’s right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. On Thursday, Musk posted on X campaigning for the release offar-right UK activist Tommy Robinson.

Robinson was jailed for 18 months in October 2024 after he made false accusations against a Syrian refugee schoolboy.

Musk, who was born in South Africa but is also a naturalised US citizen, has also been known for getting involved in US politics and was a prominent part of Trump’s presidential campaign. Last month, Trumprefuted claimsthat he had “ceded the presidency” to Musk.







“It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election,” German government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said at a regular media briefing on Monday.

“After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.”

Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition Christian Democrats and the current favourite to be elected chancellor in the upcoming elections, described Musk’s words as “intrusive and pretentious” in an interview with German newspaper Funke Media Group.

“I cannot recall a comparable case of interference, in the history of Western democracies, in the election campaign of a friendly country,” Merz said.

“In Elon Musk’s world, democracy and workers’ rights are obstacles to more profit,” Saskia Esken, co-leader of SPD told Reuters. “We say quite clearly: Our democracy is defensible and it cannot be bought.”

Shortly after Musk’s piece was published, Eva Marie Kogel, the opinions editor at Welt am Sonntag, announced her resignation on X.

“I always enjoyed heading the opinion section,” Kogel wrote in an X post on December 28. “Today an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/2/germany-accuses-musk-of-election-meddling-over-afd-support-what-we-know
Elon musk,US Election 2024,"If Elon Musk joins the United States government following a Donald Trump victory in the presidential election, he will be the latest in a succession of billionaire businesspeople to hold public office.

From the late Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and former President Trump himself, the super-rich have long held positions of power in Washington, DC and across US state capitals.

With polls showing Tuesday’s election on a knife edge, Musk is in serious contention to join Trump’s cabinet after the Republican candidate floated the idea of the tech billionaire serving as so-called “secretary of cost-cutting”.

Since entering politics after decades in the real estate business, Trump has displayed a penchant for drafting high-net-worth individuals from the private sector.

During his first term in office, Trump nominated five people as Cabinet secretaries who had spent all or nearly all of their careers in the business world, including Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos, and former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon.

According to an analysis by the Pew Research Centre, Trump’s first slate of Cabinet nominees had more businesspeople with no public sector experience than any other before it.

Musk, the world’s richest man, has called for drastic reductions in government spending, although he has provided few specifics about where he would direct cuts.

During Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX CEO said the federal budget could be slashed by “at least” $2 trillion.

“Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that,” Musk told Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald and a member of Trump’s transition planning team, when asked how much he could “rip out” of the latest federal budget.

“We’re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook.”

Such a reduction in spending – equal to nearly one-third of last year’s federal budget of $6.75 trillion – would almost certainly be impossible to achieve without steep cuts in areas that politicians across the aisle have been loath to touch, including social security, healthcare, veterans’ benefits, and defence.

Musk himself has acknowledged that such a sharp cut in spending would inflict serious economic pain.

On Tuesday, he responded “sounds about right” to a post on X that predicted there would be “an initial severe overreaction in the economy” and “markets will tumble.”

SpaceX and Tesla did not respond to requests seeking comment from Musk.

While politicians pledging to end wasteful spending is hardly new, there is no “precise parallel” to a businessman like Musk overseeing a department tasked with improving government efficiency, said Bruce Schulman, a professor of history at Boston University.

Political candidates that touted their experience in business, from former President George W. Bush to presidential nominee Mitt Romney, typically had a track record in public service before seeking to enter the highest levels of the federal government.

Government commissions aimed at eliminating waste and inefficiency – such as the Hoover Commission and the National Partnership for Reinventing Government led, respectively, by former President Herbert Hoover and Vice President Al Gore – have also generally been led by seasoned government officials.

Schulman said while initiatives to eliminate waste have been endorsed at various times by both Democrats and Republicans, they have been largely for “political show”.

“These efforts have had marginal effects, and mostly been for political show. But overall, both the size of the federal government in number of employees and in terms of spending have been flat for a long time even though the US population has increased dramatically. The federal government is much leaner than it was in the 1960s/70s,” Schulman told Al Jazeera.

John Pelissero, director of Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, questioned Musk’s standing to hold a government position given his lack of experience in the public sector.

“Without any working experience in government, one might wonder how he could be qualified to occupy a position, for example, that focuses on government efficiency,” Pelissero told Al Jazeera.

“It is worth noting that past government efficiency or reform commissions have often been led by an individual who has earned public trust and has deep experience in government.”

While Musk has been lauded as a tech visionary in the private sector, his business track record is not without its stumbles and controversies.

Since his $44bn takeover of X in 2022, the social media platform’s value has fallen about 80 percent, according to a valuation by the investment giant Fidelity, largely as a result of advertisers leaving the platform over its loosening of content moderation.

The Environmental Protection Agency has accused SpaceX of polluting the area around its Texas base, damaging a surrounding state park and federal wildlife refuge.

In September, the agency fined SpaceX $148,378 over a chemical spill – a minuscule penalty for a company of its size that Musk nonetheless branded as “silly”.

A Cabinet position would be an enticing reward for Musk, who has emerged as one of Trump’s most vocal and powerful supporters since July’s failed assassination attempt on the former president.

Musk’s companies hold billions of dollars in contracts with government agencies, raising concerns that his elevation to the government would create potentially huge conflicts of interest.

SpaceX alone has received more than $15bn in government contracts for launching rockets for NASA, satellites for the Pentagon, and ferrying US astronauts to the International Space Station.

In February, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company was awarded a $1.8bn classified government contract with an unnamed government agency.

Tesla, which is facing regulatory scrutiny from numerous government agencies, stands to benefit from potentially looser regulatory enforcement during a friendly Trump administration, as well as tax cuts and subsidies.

X, meanwhile, provides Musk an “outsized ability to influence government policy and amplify his or Trump’s views/policies in government”, Pelissero said, adding that Musk should sell the platform if he is to enter government.

Musk’s influence has already been on full display in the presidential race.

The billionaire has poured at least $118m into Trump’s campaign through his America super PAC, advocated vigorously for Trump on X – including, at times, by spreading the Republican candidate’s false claims of election fraud – and stumped with him on the campaign trail.

His efforts to promote Trump have even gone as far as testing the limits of election law.

On Monday, Philadelphia’s district attorney filed alawsuit requesting a judge to block Musk’s $1m daily giveaway for registered voters in battleground states, calling it an “illegal lottery scheme”.

The move came days after the US Justice Department sent America super PAC a letter warning that the lottery for voters who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments of the US Constitution may violate federal law.

Despite his showmanship and uncensored comments, Musk is in some ways following a familiar playbook for US elites, said Daniel Krcmaric, an associate professor of political science at Northwestern University in Chicago and the co-author of a 2023 study on billionaire politicians.

“All of these tactics are part of a broader strategy to use his incredible wealth to sway – using informal means – the US presidential election in his preferred direction,” Krcmaric told Al Jazeera.

It is not unusual for the ultra-wealthy to throw their resources behind political candidates, whether Republican or Democratic, or exert influence over the government through their business interests, such as in the case of John Pierpont Morgan – aka J.P. Morgan – who functioned as a de facto central banker at the turn of the 20th century.

Though far from unheard of, it is less common for them to seek office.

Analysing data from the Forbes Global 2000 list of billionaires, Krcmaric’s study found that 11 percent of billionaires worldwide have either sought or held formal public office.

Transitioning from business to politics is far more common in autocracies than democracies, according to the study, with 29 percent of billionaires seeking or holding office in the former, compared with 5 percent in the latter.

Worldwide, the list of billionaire businessmen-turned-politicians includes former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and former Australian legislator Clive Palmer.

The US has a lower rate of political participation by billionaires than average, at just 3.7 percent, due to the many other avenues of influence available to them, according to Krcmaric, including bankrolling campaigns and advocacy groups.

During the current US presidential election cycle, the 50 biggest donors have given more than $2.5bn to influence political races and causes – about two-thirds of which favoured Republicans and conservative-aligned causes.

While Musk has only begun explicitly supporting Trump recently after years of expressing support for Democrats, he has publicly identified with conservative and right-wing causes since at least 2022, the year he bought Twitter – as X was then known – in a hostile takeover.

Soon after buying the platform that October, Musk reinstated the accounts of numerous right-leaning figures who had been banned for inflammatory posts or spreading misinformation, including Trump, self-described “misogynist” influencer Andrew Tate, Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, and US legislator Marjorie Taylor Green.

At around the same time, Musk began using his X account to issue warnings about the future of Western civilisation and the influence of the “woke mind virus”, referring to what critics say is left-wing politics’ support of censorship and obsession with race, gender and sexual identity.

“This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead,” Musk said in a post on November 29.

As a self-described “free-speech absolutist”, Musk also dramatically curtailed content moderation on X and scrapped the platform’s “verified” feature for high-profile figures such as celebrities and politicians.

The changes drew criticism from liberal activists and misinformation scholars, who warned that they would lead to a rise in hate speech and the impersonation of public figures.

Musk’s engagement with fringe figures, such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, on the platform was also held up by critics as evidence of a sharp turn to the right.

Musk also began quietly donating tens of millions of dollars to conservative causes in the US, channelling money to the PAC Citizens for Sanity and the presidential campaign of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.

In July, Musk announced his intention to move the headquarters of X and SpaceX from California to Texas to protest against a law that bans schools from forcing teachers to notify parents when their child changes their gender identity.

Musk’s turn to the right has also been on display in his expressed views about international affairs, including his promotion of a “plan for peace” in Ukraine that critics say closely aligned with the Kremlin’s talking points on the war.

Last week, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Musk had been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since October 2022, quoting current and former US, European and Russian officials.

While many of the details of the discussions were unknown, Putin reportedly asked Musk to refrain from activating his Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan as a favour to his ally, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the newspaper said, quoting a former Russian intelligence officer.

Xi, who has pledged to “reunify” democratic Taiwan with the Chinese mainland by force, if necessary, would likely cut Taiwan’s communication lines in the event of an invasion or blockade, according to security analysts.

Musk did not respond to WSJ’s request for comment on contact with Putin, the newspaper said, although he later mocked the article on X without denying its claims.

Regardless of the outcome of the election, Musk will continue to exert enormous influence, whether from the sidelines or from within the White House, said H.W. Brands, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

“Social media has given private individuals avenues to celebrity that didn’t exist before. Trump and Musk are good examples,” Brands told Al Jazeera.

“Trump had the additional advantage of his television show, but he outflanked regular Republicans in 2016 in a way that would have been nearly impossible in earlier generations.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/11/1/allying-with-trump-elon-musk-is-the-latest-billionaire-to-seek-govt-power

Musk is making his voice heard on important staffing deliberations,according to CNN, while using the X social media platform, which he owns, to promote his political vision.

“He definitely inserts himself all the time. That’s his style,” tech journalist Kara Swisher told CNN. “I’ve heard from Trump people, calling me, saying, ‘Oh, wow. This is odd.’ And it is.”

Over the weekend and on Monday, Musk posted endorsements for Florida Senator Rick Scott to lead the Senate and invited the public to suggest candidates for Trump’s cabinet.

The billionaire also shared posts by former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, whose name has beenfloated for an administration role, advocating to “radically downsize” the government.

“The obstacles are overcoming the Kafkaesque nature of the rules governing this vast bureaucracy and ensuring that maniacally dedicated small-government revolutionaries join this administration!” Musk wrote in one post, responding to Ramaswamy’s suggestion.

Musk’s access to Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which CNN reported has become the de facto nucleus of Trump’s presidential transition, has given him an enormous amount of sway in a way that could benefit his businesses, analysts said.

His electric vehicle firm, Tesla, has already seen a boost with its stocks jumping 14 percent the day after Trump’s election win and the threat of tariffs on Chinese imports likely blocking competitors from the country.

“We’ve seen lobbying efforts. We’ve seensuper PACs[political action committees], but this is a different level we’ve never seen before,” Gita Johar, a professor at Columbia Business School, told The Guardian. “There will be some quid pro quo where he [Musk] will benefit.”

While Trump earlierfloated the ideaof naming Musk “secretary of cost-cutting”, he is unlikely to take any job that requires Senate confirmation or disrupts his businesses, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fischer reported.

Instead, Musk might serve on a “blue-ribbon committee where he would still have enormous access but would not be subject to government ethics rules”, according to CNN.

With such close ties to the president-elect, Musk is likely to push hard for deregulation, which he has repeatedly blamed for slowing innovation in his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla.

“America is a nation of builders,” Musk wrote on X on the day of Trump’s election victory. “Soon, you will be free to build.”

Elon musk,"Elon Musk fires Twitter board, making himself sole director","Elon Musk has fired Twitter’s board of directors, giving himself unfettered control over the social media giant, according to a company filing.

Musk became “sole director” of Twitter afterfinalising his $44bn takeover of the company last week, according to documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday.

The Tesla CEO tweeted later on Monday that the arrangement would be “temporary” without elaborating.

Musk, who also runs spaceflight company SpaceX and neurotechnology startup Neuralink, began his tenure at the company on Thursday by firing top leadership, including Chief Executive Parag Agrawal and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal.

Musk has also offered to buy back all of Twitter’s outstanding bonds, according to the SEC filing.

Musk, the world’s richest person, completed the purchase of the company through a combination of his own wealth, investment funds and bank loans.

A separate SEC filing showed that Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal had become Twitter’s second-largest shareholder.

Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator for Connecticut, said he would ask the Committee on Foreign Investment to examine the national security implications of Saudi Arabia’s investment in the platform.

We should be concerned that the Saudis, who have a clear interest in repressing political speech and impacting U.S. politics, are now the second-largest owner of a major social media platform.

There is a clear national security issue at stake and CFIUS should do a review.

Musk’s takeover of the influential social media network has ignited an intense debate about the balance between free speech and protecting vulnerable groups from online harm.

Musk, a self-described “free-speech absolutist”, has criticised Twitter’s moderation policies and accused the company of being biased towards left-wing views.

Although Musk has yet to detail his exact plans for the platform, he is widely expected to ease moderation rules and cut a significant portion of the company’s workforce.

While acknowledging Twitter cannot be a “free-for-all hellscape”, Musk has stressed the need for a “common digital town square” where a wide range of views can be expressed and debated.

Musk, who has conveyed discomfort with Twitter’s reliance on adverstising, has also signalled an interest in requiring users to pay for the blue check mark used to verify prominent accounts and offering different versions of the platform based on a film-like rating system.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/11/1/elon-musk-fires-twitter-board-making-himself-sole-director
Elon musk,"Rowling, Musk named in French probe on boxer Imane Khelif’s ‘cyberbullying’","French prosecutors have opened a probe into a cyberbullying claim made by Algerian Olympic boxer Imane Khelif, who hasfiled a casealleging that several prominent figures had taken part in online harassment over her gender.

Prosecutors on Wednesday said Harry Potter author JK Rowling, X owner Elon Musk, and former US President Donald Trump have been named in the complaint filed by Khelif’s lawyer Nabil Boudi.

However, the claim was filed against social media platforms including X, and not against a specific individual, a common formulation under French law that leaves it up to investigators to determine which person or organisation may have been at fault.

The prosecutor’s office said its Office for the Fight against Crimes against Humanity and Hate Crime has opened an investigation on charges of “cyber harassment based on gender, public insults based on gender, public incitement to discrimination and public insults on the basis of origin”.

Khelif, who was at the centre of a gender controversy at the Paris Olympic Games, is Algeria’sfirst gold medallistin women’s boxing. She is also the country’s first athlete to win an Olympic gold since 1996.

Boudi had filed the complaint late last week, saying the 25-year-old boxer was targeted by a “misogynist, racist and sexist campaign” as she fought her way to gold in the women’s welterweight division.







The deluge of criticism came after Italian opponent Angela Carini pulled out of a bout with Khelif seconds into the match, citing concerns for her safety.

False claims that Khelif was transgender or a manspread online.

In a post on X, Rowling described the boxing match as “a male punching a female”. Musk shared a post, saying “men don’t belong in women’s sports”. Trump posted a photo of the fight, writing: “I will keep men out of women’s sports.”

For its part, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) defended Khelif, and denounced those peddling misinformation.

Khelif, along with Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, had been cleared to compete in the Paris games after they were both disqualified from last year’s world championship for failing gender eligibility testing. The world championship is overseen by the International Boxing Association, not the IOC.

Khelif has said she is “a woman like any other”.

“I was born a woman, lived a woman and competed as a woman,” she told reporters amid the row. “They hate me and I don’t know why.”







On Monday, Khelif was met with cheers of “tahia Imane”, meaning “long live Imane”, as she arrived at Algiers airport.

An editorial in the government daily El Moudjahid praised the boxer.

“Imane’s victory is also a victory for the oppressed and the excluded, but above all it is a victory for the law, which for too long has been trampled by the logic of the powerful, who are greedy for domination and adept at double-standard policies,” it said.

Khelif’s coach Mustapha Bensaou said the boxer’s complaint in France should “serve as a lesson in defending the rights and honour [of athletes] in Algeria and around the world.”

“All those involved will be prosecuted for violating Imane’s dignity and honour,” Bensaou told the Associated Press news agency. “The attacks on Imane were designed to break her and undermine her morale. Thank God, she triumphed.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/14/rowling-musk-named-in-french-probe-on-boxer-imane-khelifs-cyberbullying
Elon musk,Elon Musk files countersuit against Twitter over $44bn deal,"Elon Musk has filed claims against Twitter as he fights the tech firm’s lawsuit demanding he be held to his$44bn purchase deal.

Musk mounted a legal defence against Twitter’s claim that he is contractually bound to complete the deal he inked in April, the Chancery Court in the state of Delaware said in a notice on Friday.

The Tesla boss wooed Twitter’s board with a $54.20 per-share offer. But on July 8, he announced he was“terminating” their agreementon accusations the firm misled him regarding its tally of fake and spam accounts.

Twittersueddays later, calling the fake account claims a distraction and saying Musk was bound by the merger contract to close the deal at $54.20 per share.

Musk’s 164-page counterclaim was submitted as “confidential,” but rules of the court require him to submit a public version of the filing with sensitive information redacted.

Chancery Court Chief Judge Kathaleen St J McCormick has ordered a five-day trial to begin on October 17, instead of two weeks in February next year as the billionaire requested.

Twitter, whose stock price closed at $41.61 on Friday, stuck by its estimates regarding accounts run by software “bots” rather than people, and argued that Musk is contriving excuses to back out of the contract.

The social media giant accused the billionaire of seeking huge amounts of data that are irrelevant to the main issue in the case: whether he had violated the deal contract.

McCormick on Friday appeared to anticipate the controversy. “This order does not resolve any specific discovery disputes, including the propriety of any requests for large data sets,” the judge said.

The social media platform has urged shareholders to endorse the deal, setting a vote on the merger for September 13.

“We are committed to closing the merger on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk,” Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal and board chairman Bret Taylor said in a copy of a letter to investors.

Musk was also sued on Friday by Luigi Crispo, who owns 5,500 Twitter shares. Crispo asked the court to order the billionaire to close the deal, arguing he had breached his fiduciary duty to Twitter shareholders and award damages for losses he caused.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/30/elon-musk-files-countersuit-against-twitter-over-44bn-deal
Elon musk,"Elon Musk’s Twitter deal stirs free speech, disinformation debate","Billionaire Elon Musk’s likelyacquisition of Twitterhas stirred a debate in the United States around freedom of speech and the role of social media platforms in regulating the flow of information.

Musk had complained about Twitter’s moderation of posts that it deems hateful or classifies as disinformation prior to his push to take over the company, but it remains unclear how the potential change of ownership may affect the day-to-day user experience.

The Twitter board unanimously agreed to sell the platform to Musk for $44bn on Monday, but the deal still requires the approval of shareholders, the social media giant said in a statement.

Many US conservatives are cheering the prospect of a less regulated Twitterverse, with the House Republican Conference urging Musk to reinstate the account of former President Donald Trump, which wasindefinitely suspendedafter the January 6, 2021 US Capitol riot.

But others have expressed dismay at the possibility the platform would allowhate speechand disinformation to spread without safeguards.

“Mr. Musk: free speech is wonderful, hate speech is unacceptable. Disinformation, misinformation and hate speech have NO PLACE on Twitter,” the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a US civil rights advocacy group, said in a statement.

The group warned against permitting Trump back on the platform or allowing Twitter to become a “petri dish” for falsehoods. “Protecting our democracy is of utmost importance, especially as the midterm elections approach. Mr Musk: lives are at risk, and so is American democracy,” it added.

But Florida GovernorRon DeSantis, a prominent Republican and potential 2024 presidential candidate, said Musk’s offer to buy Twitter “raises the prospect that the platform will be a place where free speech can thrive, not a tool for narrative enforcement”.

Musk himself invoked “free speech” after the company’s board approved the purchase on Monday.

“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in the same Twitter statement announcing the deal.

“I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.”

Hey,@elonmuskit's a great week to free@realDonaldTrump.

— House Republicans (@HouseGOP)April 25, 2022



Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally, also tweeted “free speech is making a comeback” in response to the news.

But the former president himself has ruled out returning to the social media platform, where his posts while he was in the White House constantly stirred controversy – and at times caused internationaldiplomatic crises.

“I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,” Trump toldFox News, referring to his own social media platform. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.”

For its part, the White House expressed “concern” over the power of social media. Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she would not comment on a specific transaction or any potential policy changes that could take place, however.

“What I can tell you is a general matter: no matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has longbeen concernedabout the power of large social media platforms,” she told reporters on Monday afternoon.

US President Joe Biden “has long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for the harms they cause”, including through legislative efforts to require more transparency, Psaki added.

“In terms of what hypothetical policies might happen, I’m just not going to speak to that at this point in time.”

Amnesty International USA’s director of technology and human rights, Michael Kleinman, also said that regardless of ownership, “Twitter has a responsibility to protect human rights, including the rights to live free from discrimination and violence and to freedom of expression and opinion – a responsibility that they already too often fail”.

“We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users. The last thing we need is a Twitter that willfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others,” Kleinman said in astatement.

Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from New York, said it remains unclear what Musk’s potential ownership will mean for the platform. But “there’s a lot of pushback on this,” Elizondo said. “It’s the consolidation of another social media platform in the hands of a very wealthy person.”

Many progressive Democrats criticised Musk’s wealth and the apparent ease with which he is willing to spend $44bn to buy a social media platform, with several calling for more taxes on billionaires.

“It’s hard to wrap your mind around the concept of a billion, but time is a bit easier to understand. 1 million seconds is roughly 11.5 days. 1 billion seconds is about 31.5 years,” Congressman Mark Pocan wrote on Twitter.

“Elon Musk just bought Twitter for $45 Billion — or in seconds, roughly 1,427 years. #TaxTheRich.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/25/elon-musk-twitter-sale-stirs-free-speech-disinformation-debate
Elon musk,Trump rejects taunts that Elon Musk is real power behind US president-elect,"United States President-elect Donald Trump has pushed back on the notion that he has “ceded the presidency” to billionaireElon Musk, who has taken an outsized role in the president-elect’s transition into the White House.

Trump made the comments during a speech in Arizona on Sunday, days after the Tesla and SpaceX owner intervened alongside the president-elect toscuttle a budget billnegotiated in Congress.

The incident was the latest in which Musk has taken an atypically large role in the incoming Trump administration, prompting criticism from Democrats and from within Trump’s own Republican party.

Directly addressing those criticisms for the first time, Trump praised Musk, before adding: “And no, he’s not taking the presidency.”

Trump further called the suggestion that he has “ceded the presidency to Elon Musk” another “hoax” pushed by his political opponents.

In a later quip, Trump noted that there is no risk of Musk officially taking over as president because he would be constitutionally barred from doing so.

“You know why he can’t be [president]?” Trump asked the crowd in Arizona. “He wasn’t born in this country.”







The South African-born Musk – the world’s richest person according to Forbes Magazine – became one of Trump’s biggest supporters in the run-up to the election, endorsing the president-elect in July following an assassination attempt and pumping an estimated $200m into a Political Action Committee (PAC) supporting Trump.

He has since been tapped by Trump to lead a proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with taking a slash-and-burn approach to federal government spending.

The so-called “department” has been billed as an independent advisory panel, not an official government agency, and its purview remains undefined.

Trump’s comments come a day after outgoing US President Joe Bidensigned into law a funding billthat averts a government shutdown.

The previous bill negotiated by members of both parties in Congress was torpedoed days earlier when Trump came out in opposition.

The president-elect’s main contention was that the bill did not raise the debt ceiling – a political fight Trump hoped to avoid before taking office in January.The debt ceilingis the US’s borrowing limit, a cap imposed by Congress on how much money the government can borrow to cover the gap between its revenue and spending.

Musk had also come out in opposition to the deal, which he criticised in a flood of tweets on the X social media platform that he also owns. He pledged to financially support primary challenges to lawmakers who supported the original legislation.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson later told US media that he spoke by phone to both Trump and Musk as a new bill was renegotiated.







The final bill – which funds the US government at the current rate through March 14 – gutted several provisions opposed by Trump and Musk. However, the final version did not raise the debt ceiling amid opposition from a cadre of Republican lawmakers.

Speaking to CNN, Republican lawmaker Rich McCormick said Musk’s intervention showed “he has influence and he’ll put pressure on us to do whatever he thinks the right thing is for him.”

Other Republicans have been more accepting, with Representative Tony Gonzales saying in an interview on CBS that it “feels like Elon Musk is our prime minister”.

Speaking on CNN, Senator Bill Hagerty praised Musk’s role in negotiating the bill, while pushing back on the notion that the billionaire was driving Trump’s decisions.

Beyond the budget deal, Musk’sregular presencealongside Trump before he takes office on January 20 has for weeks caused disquiet among Democrats.

The billionaire was on the call when Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following his election victory. He has also been present for recent meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in New York.







The criticism has been prompted by social media memes showing Trump kowtowing to Musk in various settings.

Following last week’s budget negotiations, several Democrats accused Musk of intervening to serve his own interests.

They pointed to his support for removing a provision in the original bill that could have limited the operations of his businesses in China.

“It is extremely alarming that House Republican leadership, at the urging of an unelected billionaire, scrapped a bipartisan, bicameral negotiated funding deal that included this critical provision to protect American jobs and critical capabilities,” Representative Rosa DeLauro wrote in a letter to congressional leaders on Friday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/22/trump-rejects-taunts-that-elon-musk-is-real-power-behind-us-president-elect
Elon musk,Why is Elon Musk feuding with Australia and Brazil over free speech?,"Elon Musk, the self-proclaimed free speech absolutist and CEO of X, Tesla, and SpaceX, is once again at the centre of a heated debate about free speech and censorship.

Since buying X, the platform formally known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk has sparred with governments and public figures around the world about what is acceptable to post online.

The mercurial billionaire is now embroiled in separate legal battles with the governments of Brazil and Australia over their attempts to curtail content deemed to be harmful, such as misinformation, violent material and racist speech.

In each case, Musk has accused government officials of stifling free speech.

But his critics say he is emboldening extremists and cherry-picking cases as he has complied with takedown notices elsewhere.

Musk’s dispute with Brazilian authorities is part of an ongoing debate about how to handle “digital militias” associated with right-wing former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Bolsonaro’s online supporters have been the subject of a five-year investigation by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes for allegedly spreading fake news and hate speech during his tenure.

The judge is also overseeing an investigation into a coup attempt by Bolsonaro’s supporters after he lost the 2022 election to current left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

As part of his investigation, de Moraes banned 150 accounts belonging to the “digital militias” – a fact that was made public earlier this year when media reported that many of those accounts were still active.

The move, which has been controversial in Brazil, piqued the interest of Musk, who in April fired off a series of tweets directed at the judge, calling the bans “aggressive censorship”.

Musk also said X would “lift all restrictions” on the banned accounts, although the platform said it had complied with the orders pending legal challenges.

“This judge has brazenly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and people of Brazil. He should resign or be impeached,” Musk said on X. “Shame.”

In response, de Moraes launched an investigation into Musk for obstruction of justice.

We are lifting all restrictions. This judge has applied massive fines, threatened to arrest our employees and cut off access to 𝕏 in Brazil.

As a result, we will probably lose all revenue in Brazil and have to shut down our office there.

But principles matter more than…

As Musk battles it out in Latin America’s most populous country, he is also at odds with Australia’s internet watchdog.

The stoush with the country’s eSafety Commissioner centres on a knife attack carried out on April 16 during a livestreamed service at an Orthodox Assyrian church in Sydney.

Police have charged five teenagers over the attack, including a 16-year-old boy accused of stabbing Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel and a priest.

After the attack, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant issued a global takedown notice for videos of the event to X and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.

Inman Grant has argued that posts of the attack should be taken down everywhere, including outside Australia, as internet users can easily avail of virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent domestic geo-blocking.

While Meta complied with the order, X has only geo-blocked the videos in Australia.

On Wednesday, Australia’s Federal Court extended an emergency injunction ordering X to remove the videos.

Musk has refused to back down, accusing Australia of attempting to impose censorship worldwide.

“Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian ‘eSafety Commissar’ is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?” Musk said on X.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has in turn accused Musk of thinking he is above the law and being an “arrogant billionaire.”

It remains an open question whether or not the courts will affirm the right of the Australian authorities to order the removal of content viewable outside the country.

Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian “eSafety Commissar” is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?

X’s legal teams are going to be busy.

Earlier this week, Brazil’s de Moraes gave X until April 26 to explain why the platform had allegedly not fully complied with the court order to block certain accounts that authorities say are still active.

Separately, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters rallied to support Musk this week as he continues his legal fight.

In Australia, X is fighting the global takedown order ahead of a court hearing on May 10, with the platform facing fines of about $500,000 for each day of noncompliance.

Musk has signalled that further legal fights are on the horizon.

In January, he pledged to fund legal challenges to Ireland’s pending hate speech legislation

Whether Musk is a defender of free speech or a right-wing provocateur is to a great extent in the eye of the beholder.

Since his takeover of X, Musk has dramatically scaled back moderation of the platform and reinstated numerous banned accounts, including that of former United States President Donald Trump.

But Musk’s critics have noted that despite his willingness to spar with Brazil and Australia, he has complied with similar takedown orders from Turkey and India, including content critical of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Some of Musk’s detractors argue that his principles only extend to figures he personally agrees with, such as Brazil’s Bolsonaro and Argentina’s new President Javier Milei.

Elon musk,White House slams Elon Musk’s ‘abhorrent’ promotion of anti-Semitism,"The White House has condemned Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and owner of thesocial media site Xformerly known as Twitter, for promoting a “hideous” anti-Semitic conspiracy theory on his platform.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, White House spokesman Andrew Bates criticised Musk for calling an anti-Jewish tweet, which accused Jews of undermining Western civilisation through support for immigration, “the actual truth”.

“We condemn this abhorrent promotion of anti-Semitic and racist hate in the strongest terms, which runs against our core values as Americans,” Bates said.

Musk ignited a firestorm of criticism when he praised a post on X, echoingthe belief, common among white nationalists, that white people in Western countries are being “replaced” with an influx of immigrants from countries in the global south.







The conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for facilitating this “replacement” through support for immigration and resettling refugees is the same belief that motivated afar-right gunmanwho stormed a synagogue in the city of Pittsburgh and killed 11 worshipers.

That attack, which took place in October 2018, was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history.

“It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of anti-Semitism in American history,” Bates said.

It is not the first time that Musk has embraced rhetoric about immigration that critics say mirrors that used by the far right.

In September, Musk said Germany’s practice of rescuing refugees at risk ofdrowning in the Mediterraneanand bringing them to Europe had “invasion vibes”, using a term commonly used to portray migrants as a hostile force intent on taking over a country rather than people seeking refuge.







Musk has expressed little regret over the recent controversy.

On Thursday, the X owner liked a post from a popular account stating that Musk had come under attack for having “the audacity to criticize progressive Jewish organizations for their anti-white policies” by critics who ignore “actual anti-Semitic politicians and groups”.

“Bullseye!!” Musk replied.

Advertisers are fleeing X over concerns about their content showing up next to pro-Nazi posts and hate speech on the site in general, The Associated Press news agency reported.

IBM said this week that it stopped advertising on X after a report said its ads were appearing alongside material praising Nazis, in a new setback as the platform tries to win back big brands and their ad revenue.

“IBM has zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination and we have immediately suspended all advertising on X while we investigate this entirely unacceptable situation,” the company said in a statement.

Liberal advocacy group Media Matters said in a report on Thursday that advertisements from Apple, Oracle, NBCUniversal’s Bravo network and Comcast were  also placed next to anti-Semitic material on X, according to The AP.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/white-house-slams-elon-musk-abhorrent-promotion-of-antisemitic-tweet
Elon musk,Who is Tommy Robinson and why is Elon Musk throwing his weight behind him?,"Not content with merely campaigning for United States President-elect Donald Trump and urging Germans to vote for the far-right political party,Alternative for Germany(AfD) in the country’s upcoming elections, American billionaire Elon Musk is ruffling political feathers in the United Kingdom as well with an online campaign to free Tommy Robinson, afar-right activist, from prison.

Here is more about Robinson, who is currently serving time for violation of an injunction but has also previously been jailed for assault and contempt of court:

Musk, who was recently named as a special adviser by Trump, posted several times on his X account on Wednesday and Thursday, stating that Robinson, a notorious far-right activist who campaigns against immigration and Islam, “should be freed” from prison.

Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth?

He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.https://t.co/Dn48JLoJgR

Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who goes by the name Tommy Robinson, 42, is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence after he admitted to contempt of court during a libel case involving a Syrian refugee schoolboy, Jamal Hijazi.

A video showing 15-year-old Hijazi being attacked by another teenager at a school in Almondbury, Yorkshire in northern England, went viral in the UK in October 2018.

Robinson posted videos on his Facebook account in response, claiming that Hijazi had attacked “young English girls” and threatened to stab a boy at school, allegations that Hijazi denied.

These videos, seen by nearly one million people, led to Hijazi and his family receiving death threats.

The High Court ruled in 2021 that Robinson had defamed Hijazi and ordered him to pay 100,000 pounds ($124,000) in damages. The judge also handed him an injunction which prevented him from repeating the claims.

However, in February 2023, Robinson began to repeat the claims and made a documentary which he posted on his X account claiming he had been “silenced by the state”. In July 2024, he showed this documentary to viewers in London’s Trafalgar Square.

He was sentenced to 18 months in prison by Woolwich Crown Court in October 2024 after he admitted to violating the 2021 injunction.

His documentary, titled “Silenced”, is still up on X and has 146.2 million views as of Friday. It has been retweeted by about 101,000 people, including Musk.

Robinson was banned from X, then known as Twitter, in 2018. However, he was allowed to return to the platform in 2018 when Musk bought it. Robinson now has more than one million followers on X.

In the past, Robinson has been jailed for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014) and contempt of court (2024).

In 2019, he wassentenced to nine monthsin prison for contempt of court after he uploaded a video on Facebook featuring defendants in a criminal trial. The trial was of a gang of alleged sex offenders who were accused of abusing young girls.

He founded the far-right Islamophobic organisation,English Defence League, in June 2009. It staged violent demonstrations against Islam and was active until around 2013.

Musk’s posts in support of Robinson come in the wake of a long-term grooming gang scandal in the UK which Musk claims Robinson tried to blow the whistle on.

In June 2022, an independent review found that the police and council had failed to prevent sexual exploitation of young girls by gangs in Oldham, northern England. The review identified multiple opportunities to stop the abuse from 2005.

In July 2024, political leaders in Oldham Council called on the government to investigate child sexual abuse in the town at the hands of “grooming gangs”.

But in October 2024, Home Office Minister Jess Phillips rejected the council’s request, saying it should lead an investigation itself.

On Wednesday, right-leaning British outlet GB News reported on this and blamed the Labour Party, which swept to power in July in a landslide election unseating the Conservative Party after 14 years of rule, for its inaction on the grooming gangs. The report was amplified by Musk, as well as Conservative leaders in the UK.

Musk posted on his X account saying British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had failed to prosecute child rapists when he was director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. He also posted on X on Friday: “Jess Philips is a rape genocide apologist.”

Musk’s posts supporting Robinson come along with a wave of his posts supporting European right-wing figures online. In late December, he wrote an opinion piece in support of the German right-wing party AfD. He has also backed Nigel Farage’s far-right Reform UK party and Italy’s right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk’s views are “misjudged and misinformed”.

“Musk’s support not just for Tommy Robinson, but also the AfD in Germany, shows just how big a problem he is for democracy as well as the reputation of those who cosy up to him like Nigel Farage and Liz Truss,” Labour parliamentarian Stella Creasy told Politico.

In December, Farage met Musk at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. On Thursday, Musk posted on X “Only Reform can save Britain”.

Elon musk,How not to counter the political sway of Elon Musk’s X,"Since billionaire Elon Musk endorsed Republican candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential race in July, X, the social media platform Musk owns, has come under even more scrutiny. Many critics have accused him of weaponising the platform for his political goals and using it to promote right-wing politicians he favours.

Amid this scrutiny, Musk’s clash with the Brazilian authorities has come to the fore. In August, a Brazilian court suspended X after its refusal to remove content and accounts that were deemed to spread “disinformation”, incitement to criminal activities and perceived threats to democracy.









Facing a nationwide ban in one of its largest markets and mounting fines, Musk eventually threw in the towel and acceded to the court’s demands.

Many on the left in Brazil, the United States and elsewhere celebrated the triumph of the Brazilian state, backing its actions in the name of “digital sovereignty” and “independence”. While I agree that outsized influence in political affairs of social media giants should be countered, the approach of the Brazilian authorities is not the way to do it. If anything, such court orders pave the way for indiscriminate state censorship of social media platforms that will do more harm than good to freedom of expression and democracy fair politics.

To be clear, X has carried out censorship inother countriesbefore this latest controversy in Brazil, targeting individuals, political groups andmovements. It is doubtful that Musk’s defiance of the Brazilian court’s order came out of concern for the wellbeing of Brazilians and their right to free speech.

Yet the censorship requests made by Brazil’s Supreme Court have also been troublesome. In April, it requested the suspension of accounts belonging to supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as part of an investigation into “digital militias” that supported attempted coup activities in January 2023. The details of this investigation have not been fully revealed.

The court has also made other requests before that do not stand up to scrutiny. Documents obtained by the Brazilian press reveal that in 2022, Supreme Justice Alexandre de Moraes had sought to block the X account of popular gospel singer Davi Sacer – a Bolsonaro supporter – for retweeting posts encouraging protests against Brazilian ministers attending a conference in New York. The same judgeorderedthe ban on the X accounts of the left-wing Workers’ Cause Party for criticising the Supreme Court.

Over the past few years, Moraes, a conservative who previously administered police repression in Sao Paulo, has consolidated the power to ban disfavoured speech across the Brazilian internet, as the arbiter and enforcer of which content should be removed as “disinformation”. If his campaign against free speech on social media is not reined in, there is little that will prevent him and the judiciary from expanding their censorship powers.

They may be primarily targeting the far right in Brazil right now, but this can easily change. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who backed Moraes’s actions against X, is currently facing criticism from environmental defenders and political forces to the left of him. If they organise forceful opposition to his pro-capitalist agenda, military policeinitiatives, and environmentally destructive policies, then we can expect they, too, will be subject to social media censorship.

As American scholar Noam Chomsky and others have documented, a capitalist media system concentrates media ownership tomanufacture consent. Yet even when the corporate media suppresses important facts and perspectives, if the government supports free speech, the public still has the opportunity to expose falsehoods and express alternative opinions. In this case, dissent is marginalised, rather than banned altogether.

However, when the state gets involved, we can easily end up with full censorship of dissent. If a government assumes the role of a single arbiter and authority on “truth”, then it can use this power to silence anyone who challenges it. In this way, all media – whether traditional or social – is at risk of effectively becoming state media.

It is true that Big Social Media has too much power to shape the flow of information. Yet, upholding “digital sovereignty” and defyingdigital colonialismcannot mean imposing the will of the government to suppress political opposition, even if it is on the far right.

If there is indeed illegal speech on a social media platform, then it should be prosecuted in a court, where defendants receive a fair trial. “Fake news” is a real problem, but if the speech is not illegal, it’s not the business of the government to scrub it from the internet. There are other mechanisms to combat this issue.

Those of us on the left may deem Musk and the far-right politicians he backs like Bolsonaro and Trump as a threat to society and the planet, but normalising state censorship of politically disfavoured speech in the name of “digital sovereignty” sets a dangerous precedent. It creates space for this concept to be exploited to “protect society” against unpopular or controversial views.

Let us remember that we live in a world where 67 countries have anti-LGBTQ lawscriminalisingsame-sex relations between consenting adults, while many Western “democracies”weaponiseaccusations of anti-Semitism to suppress the Palestinian solidarity movement. In Israel, nearly 60 percent of the populationfavourscensoring social media posts sympathetic to the Palestinians in Gaza. Should governments have the right to censor posts about LGBTQ rights or the genocide against the Palestinian people, in the name of protecting “national security” and “democracy”?

One person’s “fake news” can be another’s “truth”, which is why states must not be given the authority to censor social media.

To oppose government overreach is not to suggest that Musk and X did not also defy the Brazilian state in ways that arehighly questionable. The full story is complex and much of the detail is sealed away from the public view.

That said, there are ways to push for genuine digital sovereignty and oppose the overwhelming power wielded by Big Social Media companies that do not involve state-driven sponsorship.

Grassroots activists should press for social media decentralisation laws that mandateinteroperabilitybetween and within social media networks. This would mean that any user of any social media network would be able to see and interact with the users and content published by any other network. As a result, companies like X and Meta will no longer have a monopoly on social media publishing.

Interoperability coupled with public subsidies and bans on platform-based advertising can alsodecommodifythe social media landscape, reducing the immense profits Big Social Media is making.

A variety of independent fact-checking organisations and tools could be supported and chosen by social media platforms or their members to contain the spread of propaganda and disinformation.

Alongside these changes, the left needs a stronger vision and strategy to decolonise the global digital economy. I’ve suggested aDigital Tech Dealas a blueprint that would phase out the private ownership of the means of computation and knowledge as part of a sustainabledigital degrowthagenda.

Much like the environmental crisis, the internet is largely borderless, and digital sovereignty cannot be achieved within one country. The urgent need for drastic change to the digital ecosystem requires internationalist grassroots activism that targets the American tech empire at the core, as well as the system of digital capitalism and colonialism operating in each country.

Authoritarian censorship masked as “digital sovereignty” is not the way to go.

Elon musk,Musk praised by Chinese diplomat over controversial Taiwan plan,"China’s ambassador to the United States thanked Elon Musk for proposing a special administration zone for Taiwan, while Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to Washington reprimanded the billionaire saying its “freedom and democracy are not for sale”.

“Taiwan sells many products, but our freedom and democracy are not for sale,” Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to Washington, tweeted on Saturday. “Any lasting proposal for our future must be determined peacefully, free from coercion, and respectful of the democratic wishes of the people of Taiwan.”

Days after floating a possible deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine that drew condemnation in Ukraine, Musk suggested tensions between China and Taiwan could be resolved by handing over some control of Taiwan to Beijing.

“My recommendation . . . would be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy,” Musk told the Financial Times in an interview published on Friday.

Musk was responding to a question about China, where his Tesla electric car company operates a large factory.

Beijing, which claims Taiwan as one of its provinces, has long promised to bring Taiwan under its control and has not ruled out the use of force to do so. Democratically-ruled Taiwan’s government strongly objects to China’s sovereignty claims and says only the island’s 23 million people can decide its future.

In tweets posted on Saturday, the Chinese ambassador wrote: “I would like to thank @elonmusk for his call for peace across the Taiwan Strait and his idea about establishing a special administrative zone for Taiwan.”

“Actually, Peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems are our basic principles for resolving the Taiwan question … and the best approach to realizing national reunification,” he added.

“Provided that China’s sovereignty, security and development interests are guaranteed, after reunification Taiwan will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region, and a vast space for development,” the ambassador wrote.

China has offered Taiwan a “one country, two systems” model of autonomy similar to what Hong Kong has, but that has been rejected by all mainstream political parties in Taiwan and has very little public support, especially after Beijing imposeda tough National Security Lawin Hong Kong in 2020.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/10/10/musk-praised-by-chinese-diplomat-over-controversial-taiwan-plan
Elon musk,Elon Musk is a security risk,"Once upon a time, the world’s richest person – Elon Musk, the megalomaniacal CEO of rocket company SpaceX and the officially self-branded “Technoking” of Tesla – endeavoured to bribe 19-year-old Florida college freshman Jack Sweeney with $5,000 to cease operation of the Twitter account @ElonJet, which tracks Musk’s private jet using publicly available data.

The offer was no doubt generous coming from an individual with a private aeroplane and a net worth of some $276bn. The Twitter account provides such updates as “Took off from Kahului, Hawaii, US” and “Landed in Austin, Texas, US. Apx. flt. time 2 Hours : 19 Mins”. Sweeney also tracks the private aircraft of other members of the earth’s ruling class, including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.









It does not inspire enormous confidence, of course, that the man who has determined to colonise Mars has to resort to bribing teenagers to sort things out on Twitter. When Musk initially made contact with Sweeney via direct message at the end of November, the student responded: “Any chance to up that to $50k? It would be great support in college and would possibly allow me to get a car maybe even a [Tesla] Model 3”.

Sweeney told the Business Insider that $5,000 was insufficient compensation for the joy he derived from the project, which is about as good as capitalist rejoinders to capitalism can get.

In Musk’s view, apparently, only he is entitled to use technology as he pleases. On Twitter, this means composing “outrageous, and often lewd, tweets”, as The Washington Post has noted, as well as issuing vulgar insults, sending the stock market into a tizzy, and relaying the minutiae of his bowel movements.

According to Musk’s message, the proposed $5,000 was meant to cover not only Sweeney’s suspension of the @ElonJet account but also his assistance in “mak[ing] it harder for crazy people to track me” – a curious choice of adjective, to say the least. Alleging that the account posed a “security risk”, Musk went on in characteristically mature fashion to block Sweeney on Twitter.

Speaking of “security”, this is the same Musk whose not-so-self-driving Tesla cars have been known to come equipped with “Insane Mode” and “Ludicrous Mode” (how is that for crazy?) – and whose Autopilot software has “been involved in an alarming number of crashes with parked emergency vehicles, resulting in injuries and death”, as Time magazine admitted in its mostly obsequious explanation for choosing Musk as Person of the Year for 2021.

Various Tesla employees have claimed that attempts to bring up product safety and other concerns have been met with intimidation and silencing efforts by the company.

In other “security risks”, meanwhile, Musk reopened one of his California factories in the middle of the pandemic, in defiance of local orders, and has fervently pushed vaccine scepticism.

Then there is the slew of sexual harassment lawsuits against Tesla, which can surely also be filed under the “security risk” category. Michala Curran, who began working at the company at the age of 18, says that her supervisor suggested “that with her ‘big butt’ she should … be an exotic dancer, and tried to slap her on the backside as she changed out of the bodysuit she had to wear when painting Tesla’s cars”. Another plaintiff says she was forced to erect a barricade of stacked boxes around her workspace in order to thwart unwanted male advances.

Female employees have alleged, too, that Musk’s lewd online antics directly exacerbate workplace harassment. But who really cares when Musk’s own “security” is of such greater importance than that of his workers?

Ditto for worker privacy. In August 2018, a whistleblowing ex-employee of Tesla filed a tip with the US Securities and Exchange Commission according to which the firm had engaged in spying and hacking of employee devices.

And in June 2019, the United Steel Workers Union filed a charge with the National Labour Relations board stating that Tesla’s alleged employee surveillance operations violated labour laws. Musk has furthermore shamelessly threatened workers wishing to unionise. After all, there is really no place for worker rights in a Technokingdom.

There is no time, either, when – as Musk told Time – the “goal overall has been to make life multi-planetary and enable humanity to become a spacefaring civilisation”, starting by building a “self-sustaining city on Mars and bring[ing] the animals and creature of Earth there”.

In other Musk-related business potentially affecting the realm of privacy, his co-founded company Neuralink is preparing to launch clinical trials to implant microchips in human brains. It is a double standard of rather cosmic proportions: Elon Musk has the right to be inside your head, but you should not have the right to know when his private jet takes off from Kahului.

In the end, the hypocrisy ties into the consensus among elites that privacy, safety, freedom, and all that good stuff are privileges reserved for, well, them. By surveilling, tracking, and generally relentlessly subjugating the lowlier earth-dwelling masses, the ruling class seeks to ensure that no significant structural challenges will ever arise to such ideas as that a single individual should be valued at $276bn.

To be sure, economic insecurity is a pretty big “security risk”, as well, and the majority of the planet’s population is having a tough enough time surviving as it is without even beginning to think about Mars. “But if many never voted or signed up for Musk’s wild zero-gravity ride”, Time notes, “that is of no consequence to him”.

On the other hand, as per the Daily Mail report on Musk’s jet-tracking tantrum, “when Sweeney explained to Musk how his system works, the billionaire seemed surprised that the information was publicly accessible, commenting, ‘Air traffic control is so primitive’”. Here is betting $5,000 that Musk may just undertake to modernise it.

And as we sit back and “self-drive” full speed into multi-planetary oppression and techno-tyranny, it is one hell of a security risk.

Elon musk,How Elon Musk financed his $44bn Twitter takeover,"In looking for ways to pay for his takeover of Twitter, Elon Musk has offered up money sourced from his personal assets, investment funds and bank loans, among others.

Here are the financing details forthe deal, which was finalised on Thursday.

At first, the Tesla head had hoped to avoid contributing any more than $15bn of his personal money to the $44bn deal.

A large part of that, around $12.5bn, was set to have come from loans backed by his shares in the electric car company – meaning he would not have had to sell those shares.

Ultimately, Musk abandoned the loan idea and put up more funding in cash. The 51-year-old ended up selling around $15.5bn worth of Tesla shares in two waves, in April and in August.

In the end, the South African-born billionaire will personally cough up a little more than $27bn in cash in the transaction.

And importantly, Musk, who Forbes magazine says is worth around $220bn, already owns 9.6 percent of Twitter in market shares.



The total sum of the deal also includes $5.2bn from investment groups and other large funds, including from Larry Ellison, the co-founder of software company Oracle, who wrote a $1bn cheque as part of the arrangement.

Qatar Holding, which is controlled by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, has also tossed capital into the pot.

And Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia transferred to Musk the nearly 35 million shares he already owned.

In exchange for their investments, the contributors will become Twitter shareholders.

The rest of the money – about $13bn worth – is backed by bank loans, including from Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Japanese banks Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho, Barclays and the French banks Societe Generale and BNP Paribas.

According to documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Morgan Stanley’s contribution alone is about $3.5bn.

These loans are guaranteed by Twitter, and it is the company, not Musk himself, which will assume the financial responsibility to pay them back.

The California company has so far struggled to generate profit and has worked at an operating loss over the first half of 2022, meaning the debt generated in the takeover could add even more financial pressure to the social media platform’s already shaky position.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/10/28/how-elon-musk-financed-his-twitter-takeover
Elon musk,Elon Musk is a threat to Brazil’s democracy,"For some time now, South African billionaire owner of X, Elon Musk, has been waging a war against a justice of Brazil’s Supreme Court, Alexandre de Moraes, supposedly to defend Brazilian people’s right to “free speech” on the popular social media platform.

So far, however, Musk’s ongoing feud with the judge has achieved nothing in the way of furthering the Brazilian people’s freedom of expression. Instead, it has highlighted the hypocrisy of Musk’s absolutist discourse on free speech and exposed the immediate threat that tech leaders like him who see themselves above the law and the will of nations pose to democracy.









The spat between the self-declared “free speech absolutist” and the Brazilian judge began in January 2023, after former President Jair Bolsonaro’s far right supporters, spurred on by false claims of electoral fraud spread on social media,stormed the National Congressand tried to violently overthrow the democratically elected Leftist president, Lula da Silva.

Moraes, who was in charge of several investigations targeting Bolsonaro as well as his close associates and supporters, swiftly issued orders for X to restrict or fully remove accounts that helped fuel this shocking attack on Brazilian democracy.

Moraes’ requests were lawful and in line with his responsibilities under the Brazilian constitution, but Musk framed them as attacks on free speech and democracy by an ideologically motivated judge empowered by Lula’s left-wing government. Despite adhering to similar requests from right-wing authoritarian governments, like that of India, without much protest in the past, Musk put himself on a collision course with the judiciary in Brazil, demonstrating his commitment not to free speech, but to protecting the interests of the global far right – a group he has become heavily tied to in the last few years.

On April 3, American journalist Michael Shellenberger published a cache of communications between various representatives of the judiciary and X Brazil employees. Labelled “Twitter files – Brazil”, the published communications revealed little other than the judiciary’s efforts to get harmful content and individuals removed from the platform. Even a data request by the Sao Paulo state judiciary relating to an organised crime investigation was included in the file, and was inexplicably framed by Musk’s supporters as an example of the judiciary’s attacks on freedom of expression – and democracy – in the country.

Months later, Musk himself, through X’s Global Government Affairs account, shared confidential communications from Justice Morais, in which he was requesting the suspension of selected accounts. Once again, however, Musk’s attempts to embarrass the Brazilian justice system have failed, as the document did not reveal no wrongdoing, under Brazilian law, by the judiciary.

Following the publications, Musk continued to publicly target Justice Moraes, branding him a “dictator” and even the “Brazilian Darth Vader” in public posts on X. “This judge has brazenly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and people of Brazil. He should resign or be impeached,” Musk tweeted.  His provocations reached their peak on August 17, when he announced that he would close the X office in Brazil – resulting in mass layoffs – to “protect” its employees from Justice Moraes. He also refused to assign a legal counsel for X in Brazil, leaving the company in blatant violation of local laws.

In response, Justice Moraes ordered on August 31 the “immediate, complete and total suspension of X’s operations” in the country “until all court orders … are complied with, fines are duly paid, and a new legal representative for the company is appointed”.

Since then, some 40 million Brazilians who use the platform have been unable to access their accounts legally.

While Musk’s targeting of a judge for doing his job is unacceptable and the ban on X undoubtedly an inconvenience for the people of Brazil, the issue at hand is much more than a nation’s access to a particular social media platform, or a personal feud between a judge and a tech mogul. What we are dealing with here is the latest and perhaps most egregious example of a multinational company – in this particular instance controlled by someone openly flirting with the far right – trying to assert dominance over the democratically elected government and laws of a nation under the guise of defending freedom and democracy.

Musk’s public refusal to comply with Brazilian law, his demand that a Supreme Court Justice resign his position for issuing orders that he doesn’t approve of, and his suggestion that it should be him, rather than the justices of the highest court of the land, who should interpret Brazilian law and draw the limits of freedom of speech in the country demonstrate the danger billionaire “tech bros” controlling communication technologies can pose to democracy.

This is not to say Justice Moraes, or for that matter the Supreme Court in general, is above criticism. There is already a heated discussion in Brazil on the proportionality of the justice’s actions and whether some of his demands from social media platforms (especially for the removal of accounts that do not appear to be posing an immediate danger to anyone or currently committing an offence) amount to “prior censorship”. Public discussion on the high-profile actions of the judiciary is natural, healthy and very much necessary in a democracy.

There is, however, a big difference between criticism of the conduct of a Supreme Court justice, coming from within the nation he serves, and an extensive campaign by a foreign billionaire – executed in coordination with far-right activists and politicians – aimed at discrediting his investigations into a coup attempt and other attacks on Brazilian democracy. The former is an important component of democracy, the latter a blatant attempt to undermine it.

The coordination between Musk and the Brazilian far-right actors at the receiving end of Moraes’ investigations is no secret. On April 7, “Libertarian” congressman Gilson Marquesfiled a billto imprison judges who suspend posts and account profiles on social networks for political opinions. Later that month, Bolsonaro supporters hailed Musk as their far right movement’s new hero at a demonstration in Rio de Janeiro attended by tens of thousands. Bolsonaro himself addressed the crowds and paid tribute to Musk, praising him as a man “who truly cares about the freedom of all of us”.

Bolsonaro supporters are trying to paint themselves as victims of leftist political persecution, and Musk as their potential saviour. The truth, of course, is that Bolsonaro’s base has no care or respect for democracy – as it made clear with its coup attempt last January – and is now encouraging a foreign billionaire to attack its country’s laws and institutions to save its leader and movement from finally facing accountability.

On Wednesday, Musk tried to circumvent the X ban in Brazil with an update to its communications network that allowed some users in the country to access the platform without a VPN, showing once again that he has no respect for Brazilian law. Only time will tell how the Supreme Court will respond to this latest escalation, and whether Musk’s X still has a future in Brazil as a mainstream platform. One thing we know, however, is that what we are witnessing in Brazil today is not just a feud between a libertarian billionaire and an overzealous progressive judge over the limits of free speech. It is a blatant attempt by a tech mogul with far-right ties to assert dominance over a sovereign democratic state’s independent judiciary. What we are witnessing is an attack on Brazilian democracy and should be treated as such.

Elon musk,Elon Musk greenlit to activate Starlink internet for Iranians,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been given the green light by the United States government to activate the satellite internet service Starlink to help Iranians protesting against the death of a woman in police custody.

Access to social media and some content is tightly restricted in Iran and significant internet outages were reported across the country on Saturday, with one of the biggest mobile phone operators disrupted, leaving millions of Iranians offline.

The US Treasury Department on Friday issued guidance expanding internet services available to Iranians despite US sanctions on the country.

The move follows deadlyprotests around Iranfollowing the death ofMahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after being detained by “morality police” who questioned the way she was wearing her headscarf.

Hundreds of angry demonstrators have been arrested with crowds taking to the streets of major cities across Iran for eight straight nights. State television said the number of deaths in “recent riots” had risen to 35, up from 17 previously, including at least five security personnel.

We took action today to advance Internet freedom and the free flow of information for the Iranian people, issuing a General License to provide them greater access to digital communications to counter the Iranian government’s censorship.

— Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken)September 23, 2022



A US State Department spokesperson said the updated licence was self-executing and “anyone who meets the criteria outlined in this general license can proceed with their activities without requesting additional permissions”.

Musk could not be reached for comment or clarification regarding Starlink’s clearance to operate in Iran.

However, he said on Monday the company wanted to provide the Starlink satellite broadband service – already provided to Ukraine for its fight againstRussia’s invasion– to Iranians and would ask for a sanctions exception.

Iran has curbedaccess to social media networksInstagram and WhatsApp amid the protests, according to residents and internet watchdog NetBlocks.

Azadeh Akbari, from the University of Twente, said the digital shutdown in Iran is “a continuation of decades of internet filtering by the Iranian government”.

She gave examples of “keyboard filtering” and the arrest of journalists as a means of cracking down on access.

Akbari added with the shutdown of global cyberspace in Iran it would be increasingly “difficult and dangerous” for members of the public to access safe messenger apps and use methods to get around the blocks.

Speaking from Capetown, South Africa, mobile video journalism publisher Yusuf Omar said the Iranian government’s attempts to limit internet access is a form of “government censorship” as well as “self-censorship” of the population.

“People we are getting in touch with stories even if they do have access to the internet for a couple of hours and want to send a video out. They are really afraid,” Omar told Al Jazeera.

President Ebrahim Raisi said on Saturday that Iran must “deal decisively with those who oppose the country’s security and tranquility”, Iranian state media reported.

Raisi’s comments were made in a condolence telephone call to the family of a security agent stabbed to death last week, allegedly by protesters enraged over the death of Amini.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/24/musk-says-activating-starlink-in-response-to-blinken-on-internet
Elon musk,"Facing government shutdown, Trump and Republican allies scuttle budget bill","With only days to spare until funds run out, President-elect Donald Trump and his allies have pressured Republicans in the United States to ditch a short-term spending bill designed to avert a government shutdown.

The United States Congress faces a Friday deadline to pass a budget for the 2025 fiscal year, or else face the shuttering of nonessential government functions.

But on Wednesday, a volley of statements and social media posts from Trump and his incoming administration threw a bipartisan deal into chaos, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown.

Pressure started to mount early in the day when Trump advisers began to raise objections to the stopgap bill, which would temporarily allow government agencies to keep running at current funding levels.

But the 1,547-page document also includes other measures, including a pay increase for members of Congress, $100bn for disaster relief and $10bn in farm aid.

Pharmaceutical entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a former political rival-turned-Trump-surrogate, blasted the bill on social media for what he described as excessive length.

“The bill could have easily been under 20 pages. Instead, there are dozens of unrelated policy items crammed into the 1,547 pages of this bill,” hewroteon social media.

“Nearly everyone agrees we need a smaller [and] more streamlined federal government, but actions speak louder than words,” he added. “This is an early test. The bill should fail.”

Billionaire businessman Elon Musk — whom Trump has tapped to work with Ramaswamy on a proposed, nongovernmental Department of Government Efficiency — likewise chimed in throughout the day with posts to “kill the bill”.

“This is insane! This is NOT democracy!” Muskwrote. “How can your elected representatives be asked to pass a spending bill where they had no input and not even enough time to read it!!??”







The social media storm culminated with Trump himself weighing in, issuing ajoint statementwith his vice presidential pick, JD Vance.

Together, they condemned what they called “Democratic giveaways” in the current stopgap measure.

“Republicans must GET SMART and TOUGH. If Democrats threaten to shut down the government unless we give them everything they want, then CALL THEIR BLUFF,” they wrote.

“THIS CHAOS WOULD NOT BE HAPPENING IF WE HAD A REAL PRESIDENT. WE WILL IN 32 DAYS!”

Trump is scheduled to take office for a second term on January 20. The last government shutdown came during his first term in late 2018 and early 2019.

That shutdown was the longest in recent history, lasting nearly 35 days. Government contracts went unpaid, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees were furloughed.

The Congressional Budget Office at the time estimated that the five-week shutdown cost the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) $8bnin the first quarter of 2019, as a result of the slump in economic activity.

But Trump has shown little aversion to political brinkmanship, and his opposition to the current stopgap bill — or “continuing resolution” — is poised to avoid another government shutdown early in his second term.

“Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we’d rather do it on Biden’s watch. If Democrats won’t cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration?” Trump and Vance wrote.

Trump’s opposition to the bill, however, puts him at odds with another prominent Republican: the speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson of Louisiana.

Johnson’s predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, was ousted from his leadership position in a historic vote last year after he too struck a deal with Democrats to temporarily fund the federal government.

Critics speculate Johnson could face a similar fate, as a new Congress convenes in the new year.







But in an appearance on the conservative network Newsmax, Johnson defended his decision to put forward the bipartisan stopgap measure.

The speaker argued it was necessary to money set aside immediately for farmers and disaster relief, following a “record hurricane season” in the US.

He also pointed out that the temporary funding would allow Republicans to fully debate the federal budget next year, when both houses of Congress fall under the party’s control. The current stopgap measure would have provided federal funding until March 14.

“This was the conservative play call,” JohnsontoldNewsmax. “We don’t normally like what’s called a continuing resolution, or CR, but in this case, it makes sense, because if we push it [budgeting] into the first quarter of next year, then we have a Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald J Trump back in the White House.”

“We’ll be able to have more say over the funding decisions for 2025.”

Already, Democrats have slammed the discord in the Republican Party as a herald of the disruptions to come under a second Trump administration.

Representative Maxwell Frost of Florida pointed to Musk’s campaign to “kill the bill” as an example of big-money influence in Trump’s incoming government.

“They’ve given him the influence to make a damn post that throws a spending bill into limbo cause House Republicans are scared of him,” Frostwrote. “No greater example of oligarchy. Where the ultra-wealthy run the show.”

Other Democrats accused Trump of failing to address the needs of the constituents who voted him into office.

“House Republicans have been ordered to shut down the government. And hurt the working class Americans they claim to support,” the leading Democrat in the House, Hakeem Jeffries,postedon social media in reference to Trump’s remarks.

Elon musk,"Elon Musk, the social media autocrat","Like millions of people around the world, I have been closely following the debacle at Twitter since Elon Musk took the company over. Not only do I fear the loss of a space for free debate and access to information – especially valuable for those of us from not-so-free places. But as a political cartoonist, I am also afraid of losing the platform where I and many of my peers started our activism during the Arab Spring, which made Twitter what it is today.

Perhaps this turn of events was inevitable. For a while now, the tech industry has been cultivating personality cults. It started with Steve Jobs and his carefully constructed image of an open, curious innovator who in reality presided over “one of the tightest-controlledcorporations” in the world. While Jobs stayed away from politics, the tech bros that have come after him, pursuing iconic status, have not.









Their fervent quests to grow their fortunes and their egos have pushed them onto the political scene and exposed their self-serving agendas. Musk made his political intentions for the Twitter takeover quite apparent, tweeting in May – while the deal was still not concluded – a painting of Louis XIV, the “Sun King”. A self-declared “free-speech absolutist”, he crowned himself the new “enlightened” king of social media and declared that he will set Twitter “free”.

But watching him act and react over the past two months, I see him much less as a “Sun King reigning over a flourishing kingdom, and much more as a little modern-day dictator presiding over a crumbling regime.

Just like an ambitious power usurper, he started his takeover of Twitter by talking about “democracy” and the “will of the people”, but made a mockery out of them. He quickly transformed what he himself called “the digital town square” into his own private back yard, where he rules supreme.

Just like a classic dictator, Musk has also shown no tolerance for dissent and criticism. He has reportedly fired employees for daring to speak up against his decisions within the company or on social media.

Just like a standard authoritarian, he hates the press and does not hesitate to censor it (albeit presenting himself as a freedom of speech advocate). In mid-December, hesuspended the accountsof several journalists who had been critical of him.

Just like a wannabe autocrat, Musk is seeking to extract as much wealth as possible by merciless exploitation. He has cancelled benefits, forced employees into endless working days and even installed beds in the Twitter headquarters to squeeze any living energy out of them for the benefit of his company.

And like a good tyrant, he has overseen an exodus of people from his domain, some leaving voluntarily, others being forced into “exile”.

Indeed, I feel for the former Twitter employees. I also know too well what it feels like to have toleave the place you lovebecause of a dictator’s whim. The man responsible for my and my family’s exile is Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in Sudan in 1989. He had no tolerance for dissent – or talent for that matter – and pushed out anyone who was not a hardline loyalist, causing a massive brain drain out of the country.

In the three decades he ruled, he oversaw a bloody civil war, multiple ethnic conflicts, a genocide, a deadly famine and an economic collapse. He brought the country to its knees and deservedly won the hatred of the majority of the Sudanese population.

He pushed the people to their limit and was eventually toppled by a peaceful popular revolution in 2019.

Musk makes me think of al-Bashir. What the tech tycoon seems to have in common with the Sudanese dictator is that just like him, he is holding on to power even in the face of growing popular anger and protest.

Musk’s decisions since he came to power have been extremely unpopular. He has faced criticism not only from users, IT experts and business commentators, but has also received warnings from government officials, including Thierry Breton, the EU’s digital chief.

He appears to be widely disliked off Twitter as well. In December, he made an appearance at Dave Chappelle’s stand-up comedy show in San Francisco only to be booed into silence. As videos of his unfortunate encounter with reality made it online, Musk still claimed, “it was 90% cheers & 10% boos” in a tweet which he laterdeleted.

Musk appears to be so in denial about his unpopularity that he promised to resign as Twitter CEO if people voted for it in a Twitter poll. And they did. Some57.5 percent said “yes”to him stepping down. But he did not.

It took him more than 40 hours to acknowledge the result and when he did, he said he would resign only when he finds someone else to take the job. This is such an old dictator’s trick – pretending like there is no one better for the job to stay in power indefinitely.

But what Musk does not have in common with al-Bashir is regime loyalists – people willing to prop him up even when the ship is sinking.

Musk derives his power from his wealth, but that is dependent on market forces he cannot fully control. Big investors who have enabled his various tech adventures are much fickler than regime loyalists. They would jump ship at the slightest sign of distress which could cause them monetary losses.

That has already been happening with Twitter: many big brands put on hold advertising on the platform, causing a major slump in advertising revenue. It could also happen with electric car company Tesla, Musk’s other large business venture, whose shares have gone down almost 40 percent since the end of October, causing large investors to openly criticise the CEO.

Musk seems to be making the same mistake as al-Bashir and other fallen dictators. He seems to be underestimating people’s power.

Twitter, like other social media networks, is nothing without us, its users. In fact, it was the Arab Spring’s people-led uprisings that made the then-mundane microblogging site into the global platform it is today.

And just like in the Arab Spring – when people rose against incompetent autocracy – popular resistance is emerging against Musk’s dictatorial vagaries. Former employees have filed multiple court cases against the company, and have already scored an early victory. Users have also risen up. Some are arguing that the best way to resist Musk’s policies is from within the platform; others are leaving and encouraging others to move to competitor apps.

Musk tried to thwart the latter by imposing strict new rules on promoting or referring to other social media platforms. That quickly created a backlash and the change in policy had to be scrapped.

The end of Musk’s digital autocracy will come – sooner or later. But his troubled rule should stand as a warning to other tech bros who aspire to be tech dictators. The internet – and by extension, social media – is a space built upon people’s natural affinity for freedom. Any attempt to usurp and control it is doomed to fail.

Elon musk,Before Brazil and Elon Musk: X’s history of run-ins with left and right,"All five judges on Brazil’s Supreme Court panelvotedlast week to uphold abanon Elon Musk’s social media platform X in the country, rendering the mobile app inaccessible to almost 212 million users in Brazil.

Anatel, the telecommunications regulator of Brazil, instructed internet service providers to halt users’ access to the social media platform after X failed to appoint a legal representative in the South American country, a requirement for any foreign company wishing to operate in the country. A deadline had been set for August 29 by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.









After the deadline passed, de Moraes said in a statement: “Elon Musk showed his total disrespect for Brazilian sovereignty and, in particular, for the judiciary, setting himself up as a true supranational entity and immune to the laws of each country.”

Musk snapped back, calling de Moraes “an evil dictator” for shutting down the “#1 source of truth in Brazil”.

Judge de Moraes also issued a daily fine of 50,000 reals ($8,965) to be imposed on businesses and individuals in Brazil making use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to access X.

This is not the first time X has been banned by a country. China was the first country to ban the platform in June 2009 when it was still called Twitter, two days before the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

In January 2023, after a mob of ex-President Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters spurred on by false claims of electoral fraud,stormed the National Congress, the Brazilian Supreme Court issued an order for X and other social media platforms to restrict accounts linked to fake news and hate speech which were locally termed “digital militias“. Musk initially expressed concern, but ultimately his platform complied with the order.

In April, de Moraes again asked X to block several accounts accused of spreading misinformation about Bolsonaro’s defeat in the 2022 general election. This time, Musk refused and removed X’s legal representative in Brazil in protest.

According to Brazilian law, foreign companies which conduct business in Brazil are required to have a legal representative in the country who acts as a liaison between the firm and local authorities. The legal representative has the authority to sign contracts, handle legal inquiries and accept legal summons on behalf of the foreign entity.

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro led a thousands of people against the ban on X last weekend.

Due to demands by “Justice”@Alexandrein Brazil that would require us to break (in secret) Brazilian, Argentinian, American and international law, 𝕏 has no choice but to close our local operations in Brazil.

He is an utter disgrace to justice.https://t.co/yAvX1TpuRp

In 2021, Musk bought the platform for $44bn from Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and served as its CEO. The differences in their personalities have influenced their approach to the platform, say analysts.

“[Musk] moves at a million miles per hour and makes decisions on a whim,” said Kurt Wagner, author of Battle for the Bird: Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and the $44 Billion Fight for Twitter’s Soul. I feel like Elon often under-thinks or doesn’t sift through every single scenario before he chooses which direction to go.”

Historically, Wagner said, social media companies have worked within the law of the countries where they operate. “They’ve been willing to say, ‘if this is the law of the land here, we may disagree with it, we may fight it, but we’re ultimately going to do what we can to keep the service up and running’,”.

X under Musk is different. Elon has sort of said, obviously in the Brazil case, he’s not willing to do that,” Wagner said. “X is a reflection of Elon’s personality.”

Yet even before Musk, X has occasionally clashed with authorities in different countries. And while Brazil might today be ruled by a left-leaning president in Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the attacks have also come from the right.

In 2021, the Hindu majoritarian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered the platform to block dozens of accounts that were critical of the government and supportive of a major farmers’ protest that had rocked the country. The platform initially complied, then lifted the censure. The Modi government, according to Dorsey, threatened to shut Twitter down in the country. However, the government denies this assertion. Twitter took the Indian government to court, where its case was struck down and the company was fined.

In the United States, meanwhile, Twitter under Dorsey blocked posts in 2020 about a New York Post article about Hunter Biden, son of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, alleging that a laptop had been found with evidence of corruption by the family in Ukraine. Twitter also banned then-President Donald Trump from the platform after his supporters violently attacked the US Capitol premises on January 6.

Dorsey, in a December 2022 Twitter blog post, owned up to some of the social media platform’s shortcomings after aseries of articlescriticised some of his leadership decisions related to the company’s content moderation practices.

“The biggest mistake I made was continuing to invest in building tools for us to manage the public conversation, versus building tools for the people using Twitter to easily manage it for themselves,” Dorsey then stated.

He continued, “I generally think companies have become far too powerful, and that became completely clear to me with our suspension of Trump’s account. As I’ve said before, we did the right thing for the public company business at the time, but the wrong thing for the internet and society.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/10/before-brazil-and-elon-musk-xs-history-of-run-ins-with-left-and-right
Elon musk,Musk delays relaunch of Twitter’s beleaguered paid service,"Elon Musk has delayed the relaunch of his paid subscription service for Twitter after the billionaire’s overhaul of the platform’s verification policies led to an explosion in impostor accounts.

The Tesla CEO, who has radically shaken up Twitter since buying the platform for $44bn last month, said he would postpone the launch by two weeks to make sure it is “rock solid”.

“Punting relaunch of Blue Verified to November 29th to make sure that it is rock solid,” Musk tweeted on Tuesday.

The move comes after Musk’s earlier decision to offer Twitter’s blue checkmark to any user for $7.99 a month led to a flood of impersonator accounts,including fake profiles of former United States President Donald Trump and NBA star LeBron James.

Twitter last week suspended the new subscription service and applied grey “official” badges to profiles of public figures and major companies in an effort to clear up confusion and misinformation on the platform.

Musk tweeted on Tuesday that under the relaunched subscription service, “changing your verified name will cause loss of checkmark until name is confirmed by Twitter to meet Terms of Service”.

Twitter’s original verification system offered a checkmark free of charge to authenticated famous users and accounts considered to be of public interest.

Musk criticised the previous checkmark policy, introduced to prevent accounts from impersonating public figures, as a “lords and peasants system”.

The latest plans for Twitter come after weeks of chaotic upheaval at the social media giant, marked by mass layoffs, high-profile resignations and fleeing advertisers.

Large companies, including General Motors, Audi, General Mills and United Airlines, have pulled or suspended advertising on Twitter amid concerns about the future of the platform under Musk.

Speaking at a G20 business forum on Monday,Musk said he has had “too much work on my plate”since taking over Twitter and he doubted that most people would want to be him.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/11/16/musk-delays-relaunch-of-twitters-beleaguered-paid-service
Elon musk,Why are Elon Musk and Sam Altman engaged in a war of words over OpenAI?,"Two of Silicon Valley’s most prominent tech titans, Elon Musk and his former protégé Sam Altman, are in the middle of a very public feud over the future of OpenAI, the company behind the groundbreaking ChatGPT.

Musk – the world’s richest man and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX – has filed multiple lawsuits over the past year tostop Altman from restructuring OpenAIfrom a hybridised nonprofit into a for-profit company.

Earlier this week, Musk raised the stakes by offering to buy the nonprofit for $97.4bn to preserve the original mission of the AI research lab – ensuring that “artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity”.

Musk’s proposal was quickly rebuffed by Altman.

In the latest development, Musk said through his lawyers on Wednesday that he would drop his offer if OpenAI remains a nonprofit, which would prevent the company from accessing potentially billions of dollars in funding.

Amid their legal stoush, the two men have publicly traded barbs attacking each other’s character.

So how did things turn so acrimonious between two of Silicon Valley’s most famous CEOs?

What is the origin of the feud according to OpenAI?

Musk, 53, and Altman, 39, were once colleagues.

The two co-founded OpenAI in 2015 alongside several other prominent figures in artificial intelligence research. Musk and Altman served as the company’s first co-chairs.

At the time, Musk, as the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, was a much more well-known figure in Silicon Valley.

OpenAI began as a nonprofit, with a stated mission focusing on research and safety, rather than making money.

According to OpenAI’s account, problems began to emerge in 2017 when it became apparent that it would need much more computing power and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding if it hoped to create artificial general intelligence.

According to internal emails shared by OpenAI on its website, Musk allegedly wanted to switch to a for-profit entity with himself serving as CEO. As disagreement over the future of the company escalated, Musk is said to have withheld funding in retaliation.

Musk left the company in 2018, according to OpenAI, but was initially still supportive of its work. He went on to acquire Twitter in 2022 andfounded his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.

In the years since Musk’s departure, OpenAI underwent major changes. In 2019, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary to help raise funds, turning the company into a sort of nonprofit-corporate hybrid.

Three years later, in 2022, the company became a household name, along with Altman, following the release of the groundbreaking ChatGPT.

What is the origin of the feud according to Musk?

Tensions between Musk and Altman began to escalate again in 2023 when Microsoft agreed to invest $10bn in OpenAI, on top of $3bn in earlier investments.

Musk did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment, but his views on OpenAIhave been shared in legal filings.

Musk alleged in a lawsuit last year that OpenAI had become a de facto subsidiary of Microsoft, calling the deal a deceit of “Shakespearean proportions” and a bid by Altman to “cash in” on generative AI.

Some of Musk’s concerns were, notably, shared by the United States and European regulators, who also launched antitrust investigations into the deal.

Musk expanded his lawsuit in November, arguing the two companies were monopolising the market in generative AI.

He alleged that Altman told investors not to back Musk’s xAI and other rivals during OpenAI’s latest round of fundraising and said that Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship needed to be unwound to “preserve what is left of OpenAI’s nonprofit character, free from self-dealing”.

What have Musk and Altman said about each other?

The two CEOs have pulled punches online, in the media and in court filings. Earlier this week, the pair clashed publicly on X following Musk’s offer to buy the company.

“No thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want,” Altman wrote, using the X’s former name.

“Swindler,” Musk wrote in response.

Going on the offence in the media, Altman said in an interview on Tuesday that his former mentor was motivated by his own demons – rather than concern for the future of Open AI – and operated “from a position of insecurity”.

“I feel bad for the guy,” Altman told Bloomberg TV at theParis AI Action Summit.

“I think it’s to slow down a competitor and catch up with his thing, but I don’t really know … to the degree anybody does,” he said of Musk and his rival company, xAI.

Musk, for his part, has portrayed Altman as a greedy and “unscrupulous” con man in his lawsuits against OpenAI.

In court filings in August, Musk’s lawyers referred to Altman’s management of Open AI as a “hot-air philanthropy … long-con” and a “textbook tale of altruism versus greed”.

Musk’s lawyers also alleged that Altman and other members of OpenAI “intentionally courted and deceived Musk, preying on Musk’s humanitarian concern about the existential dangers posed by artificial intelligence”.

Why does OpenAI want to go private?

Altman and OpenAI’s board argue that the company needs to be restructured to acquire its next round of funding from Softbank, a Japanese multinational, which recently valued the company at $260bn.

While it is not unheard of for a company to switch from a nonprofit to a for-profit company – particularly in the healthcare sector –the scale of OpenAI’s endeavourstands out, said Rose Chan Loui, the founding executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits.

Under OpenAI’s proposed restructuring, the for-profit subsidiary would compensate the nonprofit entity for its assets, creating a new for-profit company – butMusk’s offer of $97.4bn has complicated the deal,she said.

“If a conversion is going to go through, the next challenge is determining what amount of compensation the nonprofit should receive. This should be fair market value. Previously, OpenAI reportedly was contemplating something in the range of $30-40bn,” Chan Loui told Al Jazeera.

“Elon Musk’s offer challenges the adequacy of that number. The nonprofit board will need to ‘consider’ the offer, and OpenAI will need to explain – to the nonprofit board, as well as to the attorneys general of Delaware and California – why Musk’s offer is not better for the nonprofit than what OpenAI is willing to offer,” she said.

What does OpenAI say about Musk’s offer?

Besides Altman exchanging barbs with Musk online and in the media, OpenAI has filed a motion to dismiss Musk’s lawsuit.

In court, it has denied allegations that it tried to block funding to other start-ups and questioned Musk’s intentions.

In legal filings shared with Al Jazeera, Altman’s lawyer Jordan Eth said that Musk’s “concerns” about the OpenAI’s future “do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers”.

“Musk would have OpenAI, Inc. transfer all of its assets to him, for his economic benefit and that of his competing AI business and hand-picked private investors,” Eth said, according to a filing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/14/why-are-elon-musk-and-sam-altman-engaged-in-a-war-of-words-over-openai
Elon musk,US attorneys general sue to challenge Elon Musk and DOGE’s authority,"Attorneys general from 14 American states have filed a lawsuit to challenge the authority of billionaire Elon Musk and hisDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in the latest attempt to prevent it from putting hundreds of federal officials on leave and gaining access to sensitive federal payment systems.

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, DC, on Thursday, says the newly formed government department is exercising “virtually unchecked power” and argues that the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official.

“We are asking the court to invalidate his directives and actions and to issue a restraining order,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said during an online news conference alongside attorneys general from Arizona and New Mexico.

The attorneys general said the court should bar Musk from issuing orders to anyone in the executive branch outside DOGE and declare that his actions have no legal effect.

They also asked the court to order Musk to identify ways that “any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used”, destroy “such unauthorized access in his or DOGE’s possession” and bar Musk and DOGE from ordering changes in the disbursement of public funds.

“There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,” the lawsuit said.

It argued DOGE’s actions threatened the financial livelihood of public servants working in sectors including law enforcement, healthcare and education.

The Donald Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce – the nation’s largest employer – by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection.

The move follows an executive order on Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for “large-scale reductions in force”. On the same day, employees and various civil service unions filed a lawsuit demanding that DOGE be banned from accessing personnel records.

New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez, who took part in the latest lawsuit, called Musk a “threat to democracy”.

“Although our constitutional system was designed to prevent the abuses of an 18th-century monarch, the instruments of unchecked power are no less dangerous in the hands of a 21st-century tech baron,” he said.

Torrez added that Trump was demonstrating “weakness” in deploying Musk rather than advancing his agenda through a Republican-controlled Congress.

“Move fast and breaking things may work in Silicon Valley for a tech company,” Torrez said. “It’s not good governance and it’s unconstitutional.”

DOGE was established by the Trump administration byexecutive orderon January 20, 2025.

Unlike other government agencies, which are typically created by Congress with a mission and a fixed amount of funding, DOGE’s budget and staffing are largely a mystery.

Elon musk,SpaceX’s Starship explodes in latest launch setback for Elon Musk,"SpaceX’s Starship has exploded shortly after takeoff in the second launch failure this year for Elon Musk’s interplanetary exploration programme.

But Musk’s rocket company was able to successfully return its mammoth first-stage booster to the launchpad following Thursday’s test-flight, catching it in its giant mechanical “chopsticks” for the third time.









SpaceX’s livestream showed the Starship spacecraft spinning uncontrollably in space minutes after its liftoff from the company’s launch site in Boca Chica, Texas.

“You can see we’ve lost several engines and we’ve lost attitude control for the vehicle,” SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot said during the livestream.

“Once you lose enough of those centre engines, you’re going to lose attitude control,” Huot added.

“And so, we did see the ship start to go into a spin, and at this point, we have lost contact with the ship.”

Footage posted on social media showed fiery debris streaking across the skies of south Florida and the Bahamas as the remnants of the craft reentered the earth’s atmosphere.

The Federal Aviation Administration briefly halted flights to four Florida airports, including Miami international airport, due to falling debris.

The aviation regulator said it had also launched a “mishap investigation” to “determine the root cause of the event, and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again”.

The mixed outcome comes after SpaceX’s seventh test-flight in January ended with the mid-flight breakup of the Starship, forcing airlines to divert flights to avoid falling debris.

In a statement after Thursday’s botched launch, SpaceX said the space vehicle had “experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly” before contact was lost.

“Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses,” the company said on X.

“We will review the data from today’s flight test to better understand [the] root cause. As always, success comes from what we learn, and today’s flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship’s reliability.”

NASA has contracted SpaceX to develop its Starship for use in its Artemis programme, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade.

Musk, the world’s richest man, has said he hopes to use Starship to fulfil his longtime vision of establishing a permanent colony on Mars by 2050.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/3/7/spacexs-starship-explodes-in-latest-launch-setback-for-elon-musk
Elon musk,Elon Musk appears at White House defending DOGE’s work,"President Donald Trump’s adviserElon Muskmade a rare public appearance at the White House on Tuesday todefend the swift and extensive cutshe’s pushing across the federal government, amid concerns that he’s amassing power with little transparency or accountability.

Billionaire Musk stood next to Trump in the Oval Office at the White House with his four-year-old son as the United States president praised his work in the newly createdDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Trump signed an executive order expanding Musk’s powers to continue downsizing the federal workforce, by which a DOGE representative will need to approve almost all new hiring.

Wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap, Musk defended DOGE’s work as “common sense” and “not draconian or radical”. He described the federal bureaucracy as an “unelected” fourth branch of government with “more power than any elected representative”.

“The people voted for major government reform, and that’s what the people are going to get,” he told reporters. “That’s what democracy is all about.”

Concerns that the White House has been moving to limit independent oversight have grown after the inspector general for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) was fired on Tuesday, a day after warning that it had become nearly impossible to monitor $8.2bn in humanitarian funds after DOGE began dismantling the agency.

Musk claimed DOGE’s work was being shared on its website and on X, the social media platform he owns, despite the website containing no information and the X posts lacking details, including which programmes are being cut and where the organisation has access.

In response to a question aboutfalse statements that the US was spending $50m on condoms for Gaza, he acknowledged that some of the claims he’s made about government programmes have been wrong.

“Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. So nobody can bat 1,000”, he said.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, pushed back at criticism over transparency, saying he expected to be held fully accountable. “I fully expect to be scrutinised and get, you know, a daily proctology exam, basically,” Musk said. “It’s not like I think I can get away with something.”

His companies hold contracts with the Pentagon and intelligence community worth billions of dollars, and critics say DOGE’s work will give Musk access to sensitive payment systems at the US Treasury.

The push towardsmass layoffscomes after the Trump administration attempted to cajole federal workers into accepting buyout offers, an effort that was blocked by a federal judge.

Trump and Musk lashed out at federal judges on Tuesday, questioning the independence of the judiciary and threatening action. Musk claimed on X that the country was being destroyed by a “judicial coup”, while Trump blamed “highly political judges” for slowing his agenda.

“We want to weed out the corruption. And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say, we don’t want you to do that,” Trump said. “So maybe we have to look at the judges.”

Elon musk,Why has a court blocked Elon Musk’s $56bn Tesla pay?,"A Delaware judge has scrapped a $55.8bn compensation package for Tesla boss Elon Musk after years of legal arguments about his pay. Tesla stocks dropped 2 percent after the ruling before recovering to close at just over $187 a share.

Wednesday’s ruling came after a shareholder sued Tesla directors in 2018 in the Delaware Court of Chancery, claiming that Musk was overcompensated. The pay package, agreed in 2018 to be paid out over 10 years after Musk hit certain targets, was the biggest in United States corporate history. It contributed to Musk’s standing as the world’s richest man as the CEO hit the dozen targets set by 2023. Musk may appeal the ruling but has not indicated whether he will.

Speaking in court, Judge Kathaleen McCormick said the amount was “unfathomable” and blamed Tesla’s leadership for not properly informing shareholders about it.

The ruling saw Musk drop a notch on the world’s richest people list by Forbes, becoming the world’s second richest person after Bernard Arnault, boss of the French fashion and cosmetics empire LVMH.

Here’s what we know about Musk’s pay deal and why it was controversial:

Musk, who founded Tesla in 2003, does not receive a salary from the electric carmaker. He agreed to the $56bn compensation package in 2018 to cover a period of 10 years.

The deal awarded Musk stock worth about 1 percent of Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of its operational and financial goals, such as ambitious aims set in 2018 to increase the Tesla market cap from $59bn to $650bn within 10 years. This meant hitting targets set for Tesla’s share price and the company’s profitability. Musk hit all 12 targets set by Tesla by 2023.

The package helped boost Musk’s personal worth and made him the highest paid CEO in the US. According to Forbes, the tycoon was worth from $198bn to $220bn in November.

Tesla is currently worth $596bn and is ranked the ninth largest US company by valuation.

Tesla’s lawyers argued that the pay package was designed to incentivise Musk as the company increased production of its Tesla Model 3. The CEO, a controversial figure because of his public takes on world affairs, is also head of the spacecraft company SpaceX and social media site X, formerly Twitter.

Richard Tornetta, an individual Tesla shareholder, filed the lawsuit against Musk and senior Tesla executives in 2018, arguing that the package was excessive and the board had not acted independently.

Tornetta, a drummer who was once in the heavy metal band Dawn of Correction, owned just nine of Tesla’s 3.1 billion shares in 2018 when he filed the suit. His shares are worth about $1,700 today. According to the court, Tornetta’s lawyers will be compensated by Tesla.

Gregory Varallo, Tornetta’s lawyer, argued that Tesla shareholders were not informed how easily Tesla’s financial goals would be achieved when they voted on the package and Musk, who owns more than 411 million shares (just over 12 percent), did not need further incentives.

Varallo also said the board did not disclose that Musk had designed the pay package himself or how close Musk was to some of Tesla’s payment committee members, such as Antonio Gracias and Ira Ehrenpreis, who the CEO has had personal and business relationships with for several years.

When it was announced, the deal sparked debate about widening pay inequalities at US companies and drew criticism from organisations such as the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a major pension fund and a holder of Tesla shares.

Researchers said US CEOs were paid 399 times more than the average worker in 2021.

Outside the US, pay disparities are also pervasive. TheHigh Pay Centreanalysed 350 companies in the United Kingdom in 2022 and found that the difference in average pay between CEOs and other employees had hit a ratio of 57 to 1. At some companies, the pay gap between CEOs and the lowest-income workers was as high as 75 to 1.

In a poll carried out by the organisation, 76 percent of respondents said CEOs should not earn more than 20 times the pay of middle- and low-income colleagues. Oil giant British Petroleum and shoe retailer JD recorded the widest pay gaps.

What did the judge say and what happens now?

In her 201-page opinion, McCormick said Tesla’s board had failed to protect shareholders.

She noted that the Tesla executives who voted for the package were well known to Musk although the CEO and his brother, Kimbal Musk, a major shareholder, recused themselves from the vote.

“Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside,’ or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” the judge wrote.

Tesla must submit a new pay package to McCormick at a yet undefined time. The judge will then approve and finalise the ruling.

Musk’s lawyers may appeal although it’s not yet clear if that will happen.

Musk conducted a poll on X on Wednesday, asking users if Tesla should change its state of registration to Texas, where the company’s headquarters is located. More than 1.1 million people responded with 87 percent in favour of the move.

“Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas,” Musk wrote.

Musk did not reveal a timeline for the shareholder vote and eventual transfer. The CEO said in January that he was seeking to double his Tesla stake to 25 percent after he sold shares to pay hefty bills like his $44bn purchase of Twitter in 2022.

Elon musk,Elon Musk says X targeted by ‘cyberattack’ after outage,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk says his social media platform, X, has been targeted in a “massive cyberattack” after the service went down, leaving tens of thousands of users unable to access their accounts.

Complaints about outages spiked on Monday at 10:00 and 14:00 GMT, and more than 40,000 users were unable to access the platform, according to the tracking website Downdetector.com.

Taking to X, Musk posted that the platform was targeted on a daily basis but the latest attack was “done with a lot of resources” and had been orchestrated by “a large, coordinated group and/or a country”. He did not provide evidence for his claim.

The worst disruptions occurred along the United States coasts, according to Downdetector.com, which said 56 percent of the problems were reported for the X app while 33 percent were reported for the website.

In March 2023, the social media platform, then known as Twitter, experienced a host of glitches for more than an hour as links stopped working. Some users were unable to log in, and images failed to load for others.

Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and promptly laid off the majority of its staff. Repeated technical issues have followed as well as a notable shift to the right in the discourse on the site.

Musk, one of US President Donald Trump’s most influential allies, posted his accusations in response to another post drawing links between the outages and recent controversies, including his work with theDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE).

Musk and his team at DOGE were tasked by Trump to slash the size and cost of the federal bureaucracy. To date, about 25,000 workers have been fired, and another 75,000 have taken a buyout out of the 2.3 million civilian federal workforce.







The billionaire’s political activities have sparked widespread anger across the US, including protests at Tesla dealerships and fires set at the Tesla factory outside Berlin and Tesla charging stations.

In addition to overseeing the firing of thousands of federal workers, Musk has also played a primary role in thecancellationof more than 83 percent of allprogrammesat the US Agency for International Development.

On Sunday, Musk waded into geopolitics, saying the Ukrainian army’s “entire front line would collapse” without hisStarlinkinternet service.

Polish Foreign MinisterRadoslaw Sikorskihit back, saying Poland, which pays Ukraine’s Starlink costs to help repel Russia’s invasion, might have to seek alternative suppliers.

Musk later lashed out at Sikorski himself, posting: “Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/10/elon-musk-claims-x-targeted-by-cyberattack-after-outage
Elon musk,"Musk buys 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him its top shareholder","Elon Musk took a 9.2% stake in Twitter Inc. to become the platform’s biggest shareholder, a week after hinting he might shake up the social media industry.

Twitter shares surged as much as 27% after Musk’s purchase was revealed Monday in a regulatory filing. The gain marked the stock’s biggest intraday increase since its first day of trading following the company’s 2013 initial public offering. The stake is worth about $2.89 billion, based on Friday’s market close.

Musk, 50, polled his more than 80 million followers on Twitter last month, asking them whether the company adheres to the principles of free speech. After more than 70% said no, he asked whether a new platform was needed and said he was giving serious thought to starting his own.

Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.

Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)March 25, 2022

“Given Elon’s prior comments about wanting to start a social media company, I would say it’s possible that he will increase his stake in Twitter or take a controlling interest in the company sometime soon,” said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co.

Musk has been one of the biggest personalities on Twitter and has regularly run into trouble on the platform. The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer is currently seeking to exit a 2018 deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that put controls in place related to his tweeting about the electric-car maker.

The announcement will be yet another major test for new Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who replaced Jack Dorsey after he unexpectedly resigned in November. Agrawal vowed to increase accountability, make decisions faster and to improve product execution. The company set ambitious goals for growth including increasing annual revenue to $7.5 billion and getting to 315 million daily users by the end of 2023.

Musk posted a cryptic meme in December after Twitter announced that Agrawal was taking over from Dorsey as Twitter’s CEO. It depicted Agrawal as Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and Dorsey as Soviet secret police head Nikolai Yezhov being shoved into water.



“It looks like Elon has his eyes laser set on Twitter,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note, adding that the stake could lead to a “more aggressive ownership role.”

Twitter is particularly vulnerable to outside pressure because unlike Google, Facebook, Amazon and Snap, the company’s founders don’t have special voting control over its future. The company has just recovered from activist pressure by Elliot Management that started in 2020 which led Dorsey, who was serving his second stint as CEO of Twitter, to set a succession plan.

It’s unclear what Musk is planning with his stake. The filing with the SEC shows that the date of the event that triggered the disclosure was March 14. The type of form used often indicates the investor isn’t seeking to acquire control of a company, or to influence who controls it.

Musk, already the world’s richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has made about $1.1 billion on his holding since mid March, based on the pop in Twitter’s shares in early trading Monday.

Twitter is under pressure to move faster in building new products. The company has set ambitious revenue and user growth goals to convince skeptical investors that it was serious about expanding its business. While Twitter has grown steadily for years, its stock gains have lagged behind industry peers.

Musk has lambasted Twitter’s recent development of profile pictures linked to non-fungible tokens, saying the social media company has the wrong priorities.

Elon musk,TikTok says reports of potential sale to Elon Musk are ‘pure fiction’,"TikTok has dismissed as “pure fiction” reports claiming that the Chinese government is considering allowing the sale of the platform to Elon Musk so it can continue operating in the United States.

Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Chinese officials have discussed allowing the sale to the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to avoid a ban scheduled to take effect on Sunday unless China-based owner ByteDance sells off TikTok’s US operations.

While Beijing officials would “strongly prefer” that TikTok remains under the control of Beijing-based ByteDance, senior Chinese officials have begun to debate “contingency plans”, Bloomberg said.

Beijing has not communicated its contingency plans to ByteDance, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the discussions.

The Bloomberg report, which also cited unnamed people familiar with the matter, said one scenario being discussed would involve TikTok being combined into Musk’s social media platform X.

Bloomberg said it was not clear how Musk, the world’s richest person with an estimated net worth of more than $400bn, would carry out the transaction or if he would need to sell some of his other assets to complete any sale.

Responding to the reports on Tuesday, a TikTok spokesperson told Al Jazeera: “We cannot be expected to comment on pure fiction.”







The US Supreme Court is considering the constitutionality of the looming ban after TikTok filed a legal challenge against the related Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.

During oral arguments on Friday, the court appeared to be inclined towards upholding the ban, with a majority of judges seeming unconvinced by TikTok’s argument that forcing a sale would be a violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which upholds free speech.

Outgoing President Joe Biden signed the TikTok bill in April amid bipartisan concerns about alleged national security risks.

Democratic and Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that the platform could be used to hoover up Americans’ personal data and manipulate the public discourse.

Elon musk,"Elon Musk wants to use AI to run US gov’t, but experts say ‘very bad’ idea","Is Elon Musk planning to use artificial intelligence to run the US government? That seems to be his plan, but experts say it is a “very bad idea”.

Musk has fired tens of thousands of federal government employees through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and he reportedly requires the remaining workers to send the department a weekly email featuring five bullet points describing what they accomplished that week.

Since that will no doubt flood DOGE with hundreds of thousands of these types of emails, Musk is relying on artificial intelligence to process responses and help determine who should remain employed. Part of that plan reportedly is also to replace many government workers with AI systems.

It’s not yet clear what any of these AI systems look like or how they work—something Democrats in the United States Congress are demanding to be filled in on—but experts warn that utilising AI in the federal government without robust testing and verification of these tools could have disastrous consequences.

“To use AI tools responsibly, they need to be designed with a particular purpose in mind. They need to be tested and validated. It’s not clear whether any of that is being done here,” says Cary Coglianese, a professor of law and political science at the University of Pennsylvania.

Coglianese says that if AI is being used to make decisions about who should be terminated from their job, he’d be “very sceptical” of that approach. He says there is a very real potential for mistakes to be made, for the AI to be biased and for other potential problems.

“It’s a very bad idea. We don’t know anything about how an AI would make such decisions [including how it was trained and the underlying algorithms], the data on which such decisions would be based, or why we should believe it is trustworthy,” says Shobita Parthasarathy, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.

Those concerns don’t seem to be holding back the current government, especially with Musk – a billionaire businessman and close adviser to US President Donald Trump – leading the charge on these efforts.

The US Department of State, for instance, is planning on using AI to scan the social media accounts of foreign nationals to identify anyone who may be a Hamas supporter in an effort to revoke their visas. The US government has not so far been transparent about how these kinds of systems might work.

“The Trump administration is really interested in pursuing AI at all costs, and I would like to see a fair, just and equitable use of AI,” says Hilke Schellmann, a professor of journalism at New York University and an expert on artificial intelligence. “There could be a lot of harms that go undetected.”

AI experts say that there are many ways in which the government use of AI can go wrong, which is why it needs to be adopted carefully and conscientiously. Coglianese says governments around the world, including the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have had problems with poorly executed AI that can make mistakes or show bias and as a result have wrongfully denied residents welfare benefits they are in need of, for instance.

In the US, the state of Michigan had a problem with AI that was used to find fraud in its unemployment system when it incorrectly identified thousands of cases of alleged fraud. Many of those denied benefits were dealt with harshly, including being hit with multiple penalties and accused of fraud. People were arrested and even filed for bankruptcy. After a five-year period, the state admitted that the system was faulty and a year later it ended up refunding $21m to residents wrongly accused of fraud.







“Most of the time, the officials purchasing and deploying these technologies know little about how they work, their biases and limitations, and errors,” says Parthasarathy. “Because low-income and otherwise marginalised communities tend to have the most contact with governments through social services [such as unemployment benefits, foster care, law enforcement], they tend to be affected most by problematic AI.”

AI has also caused problems in government when it’s been used in the courts to determine things like someone’s parole eligibility or in police departments when it’s been used to try to predict where crime is likely to occur.

Schellmann says that the AI used by police departments is typically trained on historical data from those departments, and that can cause the AI to recommend over-policing areas that have long been overpoliced, especially communities of colour.

One of the problems with potentially using AI to replace workers in the federal government is that there are so many different kinds of jobs in the government that require specific skills and knowledge. An IT person in the Department of Justice might have a very different job from one in the Department of Agriculture, for example, even though they have the same job title. An AI programme, therefore, would have to be complex and highly trained to even do a mediocre job at replacing a human worker.

“I don’t think you can randomly cut people’s jobs and then [replace them with any AI],” says Coglianese. “The tasks that those people were performing are often highly specialised and specific.”

Schellmann says you could use AI to do parts of someone’s job that might be predictable or repetitive, but you can’t just completely replace someone. That would theoretically be possible if you were to spend years developing the right AI tools to do many, many different kinds of jobs – a very difficult task and not what the government appears to be currently doing.

“These workers have real expertise and a nuanced understanding of the issues, which AI does not. AI does not, in fact, ‘understand’ anything,” says Parthasarathy. “It’s a use of computational methods to find patterns, based on historical data. And so it is likely to have limited utility, and even reinforce historical biases.”







The administration of former US President Joe Bidenissuedan executive order in 2023 focused on the responsible use of AI in government and how AI would be tested and verified, but this order was rescinded by the Trump administration in January. Schellmann says this has made it less likely that AI will be used responsibly in government or that researchers will be able to understand how AI is being utilised.

All of this said, if AI is developed responsibly, it can be very helpful. AI can automate repetitive tasks so workers can focus on more important things or help workers solve problems they’re struggling with. But it does need to be given time to be deployed in the correct manner.

“That’s not to say we couldn’t use AI tools wisely,” says Coglianese. “But governments go astray when they try to rush and do things quickly without proper public input and thorough validation and verification of how the algorithm is actually working.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/3/13/elon-musk-wants-to-use-ai-to-run-us-govt-but-experts-say-very-bad-idea
Elon musk,Elon Musk takes over Twitter in $44bn deal,"Elon Musk has officially taken control of Twitter after finalising a $44bn deal to buy the social media network.

In one of his first decisions at the helm of the social media giant, Musk, the world’s richest man, fired three top executives including CEO Parag Agrawal, multiple United States-based media outlets reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and Vijaya Gadde, head of legal, policy, and trust, were also let go, according to the reports.

Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, was also fired, the Washington Post reported, citing an unnamed source.

Following the reports, Musk tweeted “the bird is freed”, referencing the social media network’s bird logo.

Musk and Twitter have yet to confirm the firings.



The Tesla CEO’s purchase caps a six-month saga that saw Twitter initially resist Musk’s purchase offer and then sue the billionaire after he signalled he would nix the deal over concerns about spam accounts and whistleblower claims about lax cybersecurity practices.

Musk’s interest in the platform has become alightning rod for the debate around free speech in the digital age. Critics have expressed concerns that Musk’s reign could mean open slather for hate speech and misinformation, while many conservatives have heralded the takeover as a corrective to Big Tech censorship of politically incorrect views.

Musk, who describes himself as a “free speech absolutist”, has criticised Twitter’s moderation policies and objected to censorship that goes beyond the requirements of the law. In May, Musk said he would reinstate former US President Donald Trump’s Twitter account, which was removed for allegedly inciting violence in the wake of the January 6 riots at the US Capitol.

Musk has also expressed discomfort with the platform’s reliance on advertising and is widely anticipated to oversee significant job cuts at the company, although he has reportedly denied a Washington Post report suggesting he plans to slash 75 percent of the workforce.

In a lengthy message posted on Twitter before the purchase deadline on Friday, Musk, who earlier changed his Twitter bio to “Chief Twit”, denied any intention to turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape”.

“The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,” he said.

Musk, who has cast himself as a moderate, regularly weighs in on politics and has attracted criticism with unorthodox proposals for handling geopolitical flashpoints ranging from Taiwan to Ukraine.

The billionaire earlier this year announced he would vote Republican in upcoming elections as the Democrats had become the “party of division and hate”, but later said he supported moderate candidates from both parties.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/10/28/elon-musk-takes-over-twitter-in-44bn-deal
Elon musk,Elon Musk space rocket on collision course with the Moon,"A chunk of a SpaceX rocket that blasted off seven years ago and was abandoned in space after completing its mission will crash into the Moon in March, experts say.

The rocket was deployed in 2015 to put into orbit a NASA satellite called the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR).

Since then, the second stage of the rocket, or booster, has been floating in what mathematicians call a chaotic orbit, astronomer Bill Gray said on Wednesday.

It was Gray who calculated the space junk’s new collision course withthe Moon. The booster passed quite close to the Moon in January in a rendezvous that altered its orbit, said Gray.

He is behind Project Pluto, software that allows scientists to calculate the trajectory of asteroids and other objects in space and is used in NASA-financed space observation programs.

A week after the rocket stage whizzed close tothe Moon, Gray observed it again and concluded it would crash into the Moon’s dark side on March 4 at more than 9,000km/h (5,500 mph).

Gray appealed to the amateur astronomer community to join him in observing the booster, and his conclusion was confirmed.

The exact time and location of impact may change slightly from his forecast but there is widespread agreement that there will be a collision on the Moon that day.

“I’ve been tracking junk of this sort for about 15 years. And this is the first unintentional lunar impact that we’ve had,” Gray said.

Astronomer Jonathan McDowell said, however, the effects of the collision will be minor, adding it is possible similar impacts have taken place unnoticed.

“There are at least 50 objects that were left in deep Earth orbit in the 60s, 70s and 80s that were just abandoned there. We didn’t track them,” he said.

“Now we’re picking up a couple of them … but a lot of them we’re not finding and so they’re not there any more,” he added. “Probably at least a few of them hit the moon accidentally and we just didn’t notice.”

The impact of the chunk ofSpaceXrocket, which weighs four tonnes, on the Moon will not be visible from Earth in realtime.

But it will leave a crater that scientists will be able to observe with spacecraft and satellites such as NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or India’s Chandrayaan-2, and thus learn more about the geology of the Moon.

Spacecraft have been intentionally crashed into the Moon before for scientific purposes, such as duringthe Apollo missionsto test seismometers.

In 2009, NASA sent a rocket stage hurling into the Moon near its south pole to look for water.

But most rockets do not go so far from Earth. SpaceX brings its rocket boosters back through the Earth’s atmosphere so they disintegrate over the ocean. The first stage is recovered and reused.

Gray said there could be more unintentional crashes into the Moon in the future as the US and Chinese space programmes, in particular, leave more junk in orbit.

The US, together with international partners, is already planning a space station to orbit the Moon.

McDowell noted these events “start to be problematic when there’s a lot more traffic”.

“It’s actually no one’s job to keep track of the junk that we leave out in deep earth orbit,” he said. “I think now’s the time to start regulating it.”

SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elon musk,Elon Musk drops lawsuit accusing OpenAI of betraying founding mission,"Elon Musk has dropped his lawsuit accusing OpenAI and its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman of reneging on the startup’s pledge to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity.

Lawyers in the United States representing Musk, on Tuesday asked a California judge to dismiss the suit, court filings showed.

No reason was provided for the application to dismiss the suit.

Musk in February filed a suit claiming that ChatGPT had set “aflame” its founding agreement to put the good of humanity ahead of profit-seeking when it signed an investment deal with Microsoft.

“To this day, OpenAI Inc’s website continues to profess that its charter is to ensure that AGI ‘benefits all of humanity’,” Musk claimed in the suit.

“In reality, however, OpenAI Inc has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft.”

OpenAI described Musk’s complaint as “contrived”, arguing the company had no founding agreement or contract of any kind with Musk.

The California-based startup also accused Musk of seeking to capitalise on its success after seeing the “remarkable technological advances” it had achieved.

Musk helped co-found OpenAI in 2015, before exiting the company three years later.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO last year launched his own AI startup, xAI.

Last month, the OpenAI rival announced that it had raised $6bn from backers, including venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/6/12/elon-musk-drops-lawsuit-accusing-openai-of-betraying-mission
Elon musk,Key takeaways from Donald Trump’s first cabinet meeting with Elon Musk,"United States President Donald Trump has held the first cabinet meeting of his second term, surrounded by allies like Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

But one guest was arguably the most controversial: billionaire Elon Musk.

Throughout the public portion of Wednesday’s meeting, Musk stood to the side of the cabinet’s oblong table, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase “tech support”.

The majority of cabinet-level officials need Senate confirmation to join the presidential advisory panel. But critics have warned that Musk wields immense power over the Trump White House, without being elected or facing a Senate grilling.

After an opening prayer that thanked God for President Trump, Musk spoke to the reporters assembled for the cabinet meeting, offering a passionate defence of his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Trump also addressed the prospect of peace in Ukraine, the tariffs he plans to impose and mass layoffs within the federal workforce.

But key members of the international press, including reporters from The Associated Press, were barred from participating in the meeting, amid anongoing feudover media freedom and the use of terms like “Gulf of Mexico“, which Trump objects to.

Here are some of the takeaways from their meeting.

Dressed in his black “Make America Great Again” cap, Musk was one of the first advisers to speak at the cabinet meeting.

His remarks came within hours of anadministration memocalling on federal departments and agencies to prepare to scale down their workforces. The federal government employs more than 2 million workers, many of whom are nonpartisan civil service members.

To start, Musk tried to play down DOGE’s role in the government, saying it was primarily tasked with updating government technology.

On the first day of his second term, Trump replaced the US Digital Service, a technology office, with DOGE, which absorbed its workers.

“I actually just call myself humble tech support here because, as crazy as it sounds, that is almost a literal description of the work that the DOGE team is doing: helping to fix the government computer systems,” Musk said.

He then pivoted to DOGE’s more controversial functions: laying off workers, slashing federal spending and combing through vast amounts of government data.

Earlier this week, a group of 21 DOGE employeesresigned en masse, warning that the department’s functions were putting sensitive data security at risk. They also accused DOGE of dismantling “critical public services” and serving an ideological agenda.

But Musk argued on Wednesday that DOGE’s actions were necessary to reduce the country’s deficit.

He added that he was “confident” that DOGE could find “a trillion dollars in savings”. As of fiscal year 2024, the US government spent $6.75 trillion.

“If we don’t do this, America will go bankrupt. That’s why it has to be done,” he said.

Trump applauded Musk’s efforts during the meeting, repeating his calls for the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency to be slashed or eliminated.

“I  spoke with Lee Zeldin,” Trump said, referring to his hand-picked environment secretary. “And he thinks he’s gonna be cutting 65 or so percent of the people from Environmental, and we’re going to speed up the process, too.”

“We had a lot of people that weren’t doing their job,” Trump added. “They were just obstructionists.”

Still, Musk acknowledged the DOGE team had made some errors in judgement, though he promised to fix any mistakes quickly.

“One of the things we accidentally cancelled very briefly was Ebola — Ebola prevention. I think we all want Ebola prevention, so we restored the Ebola prevention immediately,” he said.

As part of the push to whittle downthe federal workforce, Musk had announced on Saturday that federal employees were required to respond to an email with a five-point list of their accomplishments over the past week.

That email came with a tight deadline: Monday. And Musk warned that noncompliance would result in employee terminations.

Instantly, Musk’s threat sowed confusion and uproar in the government, withsome agenciesadvising their employees to ignore it altogether. Eventually, the government backed away from the Monday deadline.

But Musk has since renewed the threat,writingon his social media platform, “Subject to the discretion of the President, they [federal employees] will be given another chance. Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.”

Labour rights advocates have called the measure arbitrary and illegal. Musk, however, raised unfounded speculation at Wednesday’s cabinet meeting that employees who do not respond may be dead.

“I think that email perhaps was misinterpreted as a performance review, but actually, it was a pulse check review,” Musk said, chuckling. “Do you have a pulse? Do you have a pulse and two neurons? If you have a pulse and two neurons, you can reply to an email.”

The statement was similar to a previous false accusation Musk made about Social Security. He claimed that tens of millions of dead people were receiving Social Security cheques, due to an apparent misinterpretation of the COBOL programming language.

Still, Musk voiced further speculation on Wednesday that some federal employees may not have even existed in the first place.

“What we are trying to get to the bottom of is: We think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead, which is probably why they can’t respond, and some people who are not real people,” Musk said.

“Like, they’re literally fictional individuals that are collecting paycheques.”

Trump, meanwhile, continued to advance a proposal to create an alternative to green cards, the identification documents given to lawful permanent residents of the US.

He has called his idea the“gold card”, and it would require prospective immigrants to pay the US government $5m.

On Wednesday, he announced that the proposed “gold card” would not only give immigrants the right to live and work in the US, but also serve as a fast track to citizenship

“It’s sort of a green card plus, and it’s a path to citizenship,” he said.

But critics have questioned whether the “gold card” proposal would be an avenue for fraud or whether it would function as an exclusionary device, providing immigration services only for the extremely wealthy.

Trump, however, argued on Wednesday that it would benefit talented workers from abroad. He outlined a vision where top technology companies like Apple would pay for foreign employees’ “gold cards”, comparing it to a signing bonus for athletes.

“Apple or one of the companies will go out, and maybe they’ll buy five of them, and they’re going to get five people,” he said.

Trump also speculated that the influx of wealth from the “gold cards” would not only help pay down the US debt but also bring job creation to the US economy.

“I will tell you, the people that can pay $5m, they’re going to create jobs. They’re going to spend a lot of money on jobs. They’re going to have to pay taxes on that, too,” he said.

“And I don’t know, maybe it will sell like crazy. I happen to think it’s going to sell like crazy. It’s a bargain.”

Wednesday’s cabinet meeting took place as the US also hurdles towards a self-imposed deadlineto place tariffson two of its biggest trading partners, Canada and Mexico.

Trump had threatened to impose25-percent tariffson the US neighbours even before taking office, as a means of pushing the two countries to tighten border restrictions. He cited fentanyl trafficking and irregular migration as motivation for the tariffs.

But after receiving concessions from both governments in early February, Trumpdelayed the impositionof the tariffs to March 4.

In Wednesday’s meeting, however, Trump stirred confusion over that deadline, saying the tariffs would instead arrive on April 2.

Lutnick, the commerce secretary, also hinted there could be further pauses on the tariffs if Canada and Mexico “can prove to the president they’ve done an excellent job”.

“They have to prove to the president that they’ve satisfied him to that regard,” Lutnick said.

Mexico has already committed 10,000 National Guard troops to patrol its border with the US, and Canada appointed a “fentanyl czar” to address drug trafficking, though only about 0.2 percent of fentanyl seizures happen at the Canadian border.

Still, Trump has used the threat of tariffs to also pressure Canada into ceding its sovereignty and becoming the 51st US state, a sentiment he repeated on Wednesday.

“I say Canada should be our 51st state. There’s no tariffs, no nothing. And I say that we give them military protection. They have a very small military,” he said.

“We protect Canada. But it’s not fair. It’s not fair that they’re not paying their way. And if they had to pay their way, they couldn’t exist.”

Some of Trump’s final remarks came on the subject of the war in Ukraine, where Russia has pressed forward with a full-scale invasion since February 2022.

Trump reaffirmed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would come to the White House on Friday, in order to sign a deal that would guarantee US access to Ukraine’srare earth minerals.

“We’ll be really partnering with Ukraine in terms of rare Earth. We very much need rare Earth. They have great rare Earth,” he said, adding that the deal “brings us great wealth”.

But Trumprefuted the ideathat the deal would commit the US to providing Ukraine with security assistance, as it attempts to fend off Russia’s advances.

“Well, I’m not gonna make security guarantees beyond very much. We’re gonna have Europe do that,” Trump said.

He added that the presence of US citizens on Ukrainian soil could be a deterrent for future aggression.

“It’s a great deal for Ukraine too because they get us over there, and we’re going to be working over there. We’ll be on the land. And you know, in that way, there’s sort of automatic security because nobody’s going to be messing around with our people when we’re there,” he said.

Throughout his second term so far, Trump has positioned himself as a peacemaker — but in both Ukraine and Gaza, he has attempted to assert US rights over land and resources.

In the case of Gaza, Trump has repeatedly suggested that theUS could “take over”and “own” the war-torn territory, permanently displacing its Palestinian residents.

On Wednesday, before the cabinet meeting, his social media account even released anartificial intelligence-generated video, showing Gaza turned into a Trump-themed resort.

Despite his promises to restore world peace, Trump acknowledged at the meeting that he may not be able to deliver in the case of Ukraine.

“I can’t guarantee that. You know, a deal is a deal. Lots of crazy things happen in deals, right? But I think we’re gonna have a deal,” he said.

A journalist asked him afterwards if Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to make concessions as part of the peace negotiations.

“Yeah, he will. He’s gonna have to,” Trump replied.

Another journalist quickly asked what concessions the US president would like to see. But Trump used the question to pivot. Instead of answering, he once again blamed Ukraine for starting Russia’s invasion by seeking to join theNATO military alliance.

“NATO, you can forget about. I think that’s probably the reason the whole thing started,” Trump said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/key-takeaways-from-donald-trumps-first-cabinet-meeting-with-elon-musk
Elon musk,Elon Musk and all that was wrong with 2021,"Time magazine recently chose Elon Musk – the “richest private citizen in history” and the CEO of rocket firm SpaceX and electric vehicle company Tesla – as its “2021 Person of the Year”. In the first paragraph of the lengthy profile of Musk accompanying the accolade, we learn that the man “tosses satellites into orbit and harnesses the sun”, sends the stock market soaring and swooning with a “flick of his finger”, and also “likes to live-tweet his poops”.

The second paragraph of the profile is devoted to further exploring this last theme:









“‘Just dropping some friends off at the pool’, the 50-year-old zillionaire informed his 66 million Twitter followers on the evening of Nov. 29, having previously advised that at least half his tweets were ‘made on a porcelain throne’”.

Presumably, the excremental intro is meant to project a down-to-earth, human dimension onto the tyrannical South African entrepreneur who wants to colonise Mars and has officially appointed himself “Technoking” of Tesla. Call it poop-washing, if you will.

For the next zillion or so paragraphs of the profile, Time magazine proceeds with its grotesque apologetics on behalf of 2021’s Chosen Person – explaining that, while Musk is “easily cast as a hubristic supervillain, lumped in with the tech bros and the space playboys”, he is ultimately “different”. This assessment appears directly after a discussion of Musk’s downplaying of the coronavirus threat and violation of local pandemic regulations to keep his factories running – all of which, Time muses, suggests that “the vast expanse of human misery can seem an afterthought to a man with his eyes on Mars”.

Might it not be more charming, then, to select a Person of the Year who is actually concerned with alleviating human misery – as opposed to someone chasing a dystopian vision of an exclusive future universe run by and for Elon Musk? Granted, this is the same magazine that named Adolf Hitler “Man of the Year” in 1938.

Marveling at “the man who aspires to save our planet and get us a new one to inhabit”, Time asserts that Musk is “arguably the biggest private contributor to the fight against climate change”. For a more grounded view of reality, consider the words of Max Ajl, author of the acclaimed book, A People’s Green New Deal, who remarked in an email to me that: “if capitalist destruction of the ecology were to take on human form, it would look like the Afrikaner aspiring cosmonaut Elon Musk”.

Ajl went on to observe, “In true apartheid form, spaceship rides envisioned by the Tesla tycoon will emit more CO2 in a few minutes than poor people emit in their entire lives”.

Capitalism, of course, is fundamentally anti-human – as, it seems, is Musk, whose own brother and business partner Kimbal acknowledges in the Time profile that Elon’s “gift is not empathy with people”.

Case in point: in October, a federal jury ordered Tesla to pay almost $137m to a Black ex-employee who, as the Washington Post notes, claimed workers were subjected to “a scene ‘straight from the Jim Crow era’”, characterised by rampant racist abuse and supervisors who refused to address the issue.

Then in December, six women filed separate suits against Tesla for alleged sexual harassment in the workplace – with many of them contending that Musk’s own frequent lewd behaviour on Twitter only encouraged sexual taunts and other abuse in a male-dominated work environment.

Add to this Musk’s willful endangerment of employees’ lives during the pandemic and other violations of labour laws – including his underhanded machinations and threats against workers wishing to unionise – and one begins to worry about how that whole Mars idea will pan out.

But anyway, why should workers bother trying to exert a modicum of control over their existences when the “brooding, blue-skinned man-god” – words courtesy of Time – already knows what is best for them? Again, it appears that Musk and only Musk knows what is good for everyone – like when he implied to Time that, were he to pay US government taxes proportionate to his astronomical wealth, this would “not result in, actually, the good of the people”, because the US government is “inherently not a good steward of capital”.

Never mind that this same government has also flung its capital at – what do you know? – Musk’s own projects, including via a critical $465m federal loan to Tesla in 2009. In fact, Musk and his companies have benefitted over the years from billions of dollars in public subsidies and government contracts. And yet, when US Senator Ron Wyden tweeted in November in favour of a Billionaires Income Tax, Musk tweeted back in Twitter shorthand with the mature and relevant suggestion that Wyden’s profile picture looked like he had just had an orgasm.

The Time tribute does mention these incidents, but manages to cast them as the fallout of a fascinatingly complex mind: that of a “clown, genius, edgelord, visionary, industrialist, showman, cad” as well as a “shy South African with Asperger’s syndrome, who escaped a brutal childhood and overcame personal tragedy” to pursue “cosmic ambition”. Muskian petulant tyranny is euphemised into a “hard-driving style” that takes a “legendary” toll on his staff. Tesla is said to maintain a “hard-charging approach”.

But while Time’s selection of Musk as its person of 2021 has rightfully generated controversy, he does perhaps appropriately embody what was an all-around sick year in terms of capitalism and the related maladies of coronavirus and climate change.

And as the world’s richest man tweets away from his porcelain throne into an ever more brutal future of elite despotism and collective tragedy, it seems it is a very fecal matter, indeed.

Elon musk,Ban on Elon Musk’s X platform upheld by Brazil Supreme Court,"All five judges on a Supreme Court panel have voted to uphold abanon Elon Musk’s X social media platform in Brazil.

The move on Monday backs the decision by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, one of the five judges, to shut down X in Brazil. The ban, which went into effect on Saturday, was ordered by Moraes after the company missed acourt-imposed deadlineto name a legal representative in the South American country.

“It is not possible for a company to operate in the territory of a country and intend to impose its vision on which rules should be valid or applied,” Justice Flavio Dino said as he joined Justice Cristiano Zanin in siding with Moraes.

“A party that intentionally fails to comply with court decisions appears to consider itself above the rule of law. And so it can turn into an outlaw.”

Justices Carmen Lucia and Luiz Fux also backed Moraes, making the decision unanimous. However, some of the judges said that the suspension could be reversed if X complies with previous court rulings.

Moraes’soriginal order, which was released on Friday, had called Musk an “outlaw” who intended to “allow the massive spread of disinformation, hate speech and attacks on the democratic rule of law, violating the free choice of the electorate, by keeping voters away from real and accurate information”.

It ordered all telecom providers in the country to shut down X. The ban is to remain in place until X complies with Moraes’s order and pays outstanding fines that exceeded $3m as of last week.







Musk, who bought X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, decried the move as censorship. On Friday, he called the platform the top “source of Truth” in Brazil. He further called Moraes a “dictator”.

Since X was purchased by Musk, the South African-born businessman got rid of most of the platform’s content moderation teams, and has increasingly pushed far-right content and unsubstantiated claims on his own personal feed, most recently getting into aspat with the United Kingdom’s governmentover anti-migrant and anti-Muslim riots in the country. He has also endorsed Donald Trump for United States president, and in Augustheld a deferential interviewwith the former president and Republican candidate for November’s election.

But Brazil appears to be serious about clamping down on X in its current iteration. The ban threatens one of the company’s largest markets, and comes at a time when Musk has struggled to harness advertising revenue. There are an estimated 40 million X users in Brazil, which has a population of about 215 million.

Companies and individuals caught using the platform through an encrypted connection can face hefty fines of up to 50,000 reais ($9,000) per day.

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also weighed in on Monday, telling CNN Brasil he was “satisfied” with the Supreme Court panel’s decision and that it sends a message.

Meanwhile, shortly before the vote, satellite internet provider Starlink notified Brazil’s telecom regulator, Anatel, it would not comply with the order to ban X.

Starlink is also owned by Musk and is a subsidiary of his SpaceX company.

Moraes last week froze Starlink’s Brazilian bank accounts, in a decision that stemmed from a separate dispute over unpaid fines X was ordered to pay due to its failure to turn over some documents.

Starlink, which has more than 200,000 customers in Brazil, said it would not comply with the order to ban X until its accounts were unfrozen.

In response, Anatel warned that Starlink could face several sanctions, including having its local licence revoked.

It added that Starlink is so far the only telecoms provider to resist the ban.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/2/ban-on-elon-musks-x-platform-upheld-by-brazil-supreme-court
Elon musk,Trump ally Steve Bannon blasts Elon Musk as ‘truly evil’ in MAGA split,"United States President-elect Donald Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon has promised to haveElon Musk“run out” of the White House, in the latest escalation of tensions within the MAGA (Make America Great Again) populist movement.

In an interview with an Italian newspaper, Bannon said he had made it his personal mission to ensure Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, does not have access to Trump’s incoming administration and is treated “like any other person”.

“He is a truly evil guy, a very bad guy. I made it my personal thing to take this guy down. Before, because he put money in, I was prepared to tolerate it – I’m not prepared to tolerate it any more,” Bannon told the Corriere della Sera newspaper, excerpts of which were republished over the weekend by Bannon’s former media outlet Breitbart News.

Bannon also said that Musk, a South African-born naturalised US citizen, should “go back” to his place of birth after the billionaire publicly defended the use of theH-1B visa programmeto recruit highly-skilled foreign tech workers.

“Why do we have South Africans, the most racist people on earth, white South Africans, we have them making any comments at all on what goes on in the United States?”







Bannon’s broadside comes amid a public rift among Trump’s followers over the role of foreign employees in Silicon Valley.

The divisions burst into view last month after Trump’s decision to name Indian American venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan as an adviser on artificial intelligence unleashed a wave of invective from far-right and nationalist MAGA followers, who interpreted the appointment as an endorsement of H-1B visas.

Musk, who held an H-1B visa before obtaining US citizenship, hit out at the criticism of foreign workers in Silicon Valley, promising to “go to war on this issue” to a degree “you cannot possibly comprehend”.

Despite taking steps to restrict H-1B visa issuances during his first term, Trump sided with Musk’s comments, calling the visas a “great programme.”

In his newspaper interview, Bannon, who served as White House chief strategist during Trump’s first term, accused Musk of having the “maturity of a little boy” and attempting to establish “techno-feudalism on a global scale”.

“We’ve seen peak Elon, his intrusive nature, his lack of understanding of the true issues, and, quite frankly, his support of just himself, the sole objective is to become a trillionaire. That’s his objective,” he said.

“He will do anything related to make sure that any one of his companies is protected or has a better deal or he makes more money. His aggregation of wealth, and then – through wealth – power: that’s what he’s focused on. The American working people in this country are not going to tolerate it.”

Musk, who is a prolific commentator on news events on his social media platform X, has not publicly responded to Bannon’s remarks.

Ranked as the world’s richest person with a net worth of more than $400bn, Musk has become one of Trump’s most powerful and influential allies since he publicly endorsed the Republican following his attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13.

Elon musk,USAID officials put on leave as Elon Musk says time for agency to ‘die’,"Elon Musk hasdeclaredthat the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) should “die” amid reports that two top security officials at the aid agency were put on leave for refusing his representatives access to classified materials.

Musk, who was appointed by US President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), on Monday branded USAID a “criminal organisation” after security officials reportedly denied members of his cost-cutting task force access to restricted areas of the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC.

“Time for it to die,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X.

USAID’s director of security, John Voorhees, and his deputy, Brian McGill, were placed on leave after denying DOGE personnel entry to secure areas over their lack of security clearances, multiple US media outlets reported, citing unnamed officials.

The representatives of DOGE, which was created in an executive order by Trump but is not a government department, were ultimately able to access areas with classified information following the confrontation, which was first reported by CNN, according to multiple reports.

Steven Cheung, the White House director of communications, denied that DOGE personnel had attempted to gain access to secure areas, calling a PBS report about the incident “fake news” and “not even remotely true at all”.

“This is how unserious and untrustworthy the media is,” Cheung said in a post on X.

However, Katie Miller, who serves in DOGE, appeared to acknowledge the task force’s attempted entry, writing on X that “no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances”.







The incident has added to concerns that Trump, who has placed afreeze on nearly all foreign aid, is planning to radically curtail, or even outright dismantle, USAID.

On Saturday, the USAID website went offline while a barebones page for the agency appeared on the website of the Department of State, fuelling speculation it would be subsumed into the government agency tasked with managing foreign policy.

“President Trump spent two weeks harassing and laying off USAID employees, and now his team is trying to gut the agency altogether,” Chris Coons, a Democratic senator for the state of Delaware, said on X.

“These are patriotic Americans who promote our leadership around the world. They make us safer. Trump makes us less safe.”

Jeremy Konyndyk, who served as director of USAID’s Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance between 2013 and 2017, said that eliminating USAID without an act of Congress would be unlawful and a breach of the separation of powers enshrined in the US Constitution.

“If this gambit succeeds – if Trump (or Elon) can just override Congressional statutes and funding mandates, and Congress acquiesces – it’s a very dark sign … and it won’t stop at USAID,” Konyndyk said on X.

Democratic lawmakers also raised alarm about the scale of Musk’s influence over the government despite him not holding elected office.

Musk’s clash with USAID comes after The New York Times and The Associated Press news agency reported over the weekend that DOGE had gained access to the federal payment system, which holds sensitive personal information about millions of Americans.

“This is a five alarm fire. The people elected Donald Trump to be President – not Elon Musk,” New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on X.

“Having an unelected billionaire, with his own foreign debts and motives, raiding US classified information is a grave threat to national security. This should not be a partisan issue.”







On Sunday, Trump told reporters that his administration would get the “radical lunatics” out of USAID before making a decision on its future.

Trump later singled out aid to South Africa, pledging to cut off “all future funding” in response to land confiscations and what he said was the poor treatment of “certain classes of people”.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last week signed a controversial law that allows the confiscation of white farmers’ land without compensation in certain cases.

The US allocated nearly $440m in assistance to South Africa in 2023, according to US government data.

“The United States won’t stand for it, we will act,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, adding that the funding freeze would stay in place until a “full investigation of this situation has been completed”.

The US is by far the world’s largest source of foreign assistance, although less than 1 percent of its spending goes to aid and some other countries give more as a proportion of their budgets.

Washington gave out $72bn in foreign aid across nearly 180 countries in 2023, with more than half of it disbursed through USAID.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/3/usaid-officials-put-on-leave-as-elon-musk-says-time-for-agency-to-die
Elon musk,Musk accused of giving Nazi salute during Trump inauguration celebrations,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has come under fire after making hand gestures resemblingthe Nazi saluteduring a speech celebrating the presidentialinauguration of Donald Trump.

Addressing Trump supporters hours after the Republican was inaugurated as the 47th US president on Monday, Musk hailed the outcome of the November 4 election as “no ordinary victory”.

“This was a fork in the road of human civilisation,” Musk said at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC.

“This one really mattered. Thank you for making it happen! Thank you.”

Musk then slapped his right hand on his chest before extending his arm at an upward angle with his palm down and fingers together.

Wait, did Musk just do a Nazi salute?pic.twitter.com/VZChlQXSYv

— Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump)January 20, 2025



The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who has beentasked with leadingthe newly formed Department of Government Efficiency in Trump’s administration, then turned around to face the crowd behind him and repeated the gesture.

Musk’s actions drew immediate scrutiny online, with some social media users accusing him of giving the infamous Sieg Heil salute associated with Adolf Hitler.

“I never imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal,” Jerry Nadler, a Democratic congressman from New York, said in a post on X.

“This abhorrent gesture has no place in our society and belongs in the darkest chapters of human history. I urge all of my colleagues to unite in condemning this hateful gesture for what it is: antisemitism.”

Musk’s gesture, which received praise from a number of US-based neo-Nazis, also garnered attention in the Israeli media, with the newspaper Haaretz saying Musk appeared to have given a “‘Roman salute,’ a fascist salute most commonly associated with Nazi Germany”.

Responding to the controversy, Musk said his critics needed “better dirty tricks”.

“The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired,” Musk said in an X post that included a sleepy face emoji.

Al Jazeera did not immediately receive a response to requests for comment sent to Musk’s lawyer and several of his companies.

Some figures and groups defended Musk, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), one of the most prominent organisations dedicated to opposing anti-Semitism.

The New York-based organisation, which has faced criticism for conflating opposition to Israel with anti-Semitism, said it seemed the billionaire had made an “awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute”.

“In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath,” the ADL said in a post on X.

“This is a new beginning. Let’s hope for healing and work toward unity in the months and years ahead.”

Max Kaiser, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, said he believed that Musk had “unambiguously” made a Nazi salute and criticised the ADL for defending the billionaire.

“It was a clear signal to his rabid white nationalist and neo-Nazi followers that he aligns with their values,” Kaiser told Al Jazeera.

“His platform ‘X’ is well known for promoting racist neo-Nazi content and he has recently endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) German political party. We should all be very concerned that the right-hand man of the most powerful person in the world is a Nazi. The ADL continue to disgrace themselves by defending Musk’s gesture while baselessly attacking expressions of pro-Palestinian solidarity as anti-Semitic.”

However, Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said it was more likely Musk had been simply “overcome with passion and emotion in that moment and gestured appreciatively to the crowd.”

“It is inconceivable that someone who has visited the death camps and has expressed strong support for the Jewish people would have in any way intended to display a Nazi salute,” Ryvchin told Al Jazeera.

“When many countries are engulfed by an antisemitism crisis with near daily attacks on homes, schools and places of worship, focusing on incidents like this distracts from the real antisemitism that has been projected into the West by the anti-Israel movement. This is the battle all decent people concerned for anti-racism and human rights should be united in.”

Musk’s politics have shifted sharply right since he publicly came out in support of Trump after the Republican narrowly survived an attempted assassination in July.

Elon musk,Elon Musk backs Germany’s far-right AfD before elections,"US billionaire Elon Musk has backed the far-rightAlternative for Germany(AfD) party as the European country gears up for elections in February.

The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a centre-right or centre-left majority. However Germany’s mainstream, more centrist parties have promised to refuse to form a coalition with the AfD at the national level.

“Only the AfD can save Germany,” Musk wrote on Friday in a post on his social media platform, X.

Europe’s largest economy is expected to vote on February 23 after a centre-left coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed.

Musk, who is set to join US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration as an adviser, has already expressed support for other far-right, anti-immigration parties across Europe.

The German government said it has taken note of Musk’s post but declined to give any further comment at its regular news conference.

Scholz told reporters at a news conference that freedom of opinion “also applies to multibillionaires” and “means that you can say things that are incorrect and do not contain good political advice”.

Musk, the world’s richest person, previously voiced supportfor the AfD last yearwhen he attacked the German government’s handling of undocumented immigration.

Last month, Musk called for the sacking of Italian judges who had questioned the legality of government measures to prevent irregular immigration.

German lawmakers from across the mainstream parties reacted with outrage to Musk’s comment.

“It is threatening, irritating and unacceptable for a key figure in the future US government to interfere in the German election campaign,” Dennis Radtke, a member of the European Parliament for the centre-right Christian Democratic Union, told the Handelsblatt daily.

Radtke called Musk a “threat to democracy in the Western world”, accusing the world’s richest man of turning X, previously called Twitter, into a “disinformation slingshot”.







Alex Schaefer, a lawmaker from Scholz’s centre-left Social Democrats, said Musk’s post was “completely unacceptable”.

“We are very close to the Americans, but now bravery is required towards our friend. We object to interference in our election campaign,” Schaefer told the Tagesspiegel daily.

Former Finance Minister Christian Lindner from the pro-business Free Democratic Party, said some of Musk’s ideas had “inspired” him but urged the Tesla boss not to “rush to conclusions from afar”.

“While migration control is crucial for Germany, the AfD stands against freedom, business – and it’s a far-right extremist party,” the politician posted.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/20/elon-musk-backs-germanys-far-right-afd-before-elections
Elon musk,Trump names Musk and Ramaswamy to head new government efficiency department,"United States President-electDonald Trumphas named tech magnateElon Muskand former Republican presidential candidateVivek Ramaswamyas his picks to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, a new body he plans to establish once he returns to the White House.

“Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” Trump said in a statement on Tuesday.

“Importantly, we will drive out the massive waste and fraud which exists throughout our annual $6.5 Trillion Dollars of Government Spending.”

Trump added that, under his plan, Musk and Ramaswamy would conclude their work by July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.

“A smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy, will be the perfect gift to America,” Trump said.







The proposed department appears to have been inspired by a conversation Trump had on the campaign trail with Musk, one of his most prominent supporters.

On August 13, the two men sat down for a two-hourlive broadcaston Musk’s social media platform X, where the billionaire pitched Trump on the idea of forming a new “commission” to crack down on government waste.

“You’re the greatest cutter,” Trump replied. “I need an Elon Musk. I need somebody that has a lot of strength and courage and smarts.”

Trump laterrevisited the ideaon the campaign trail, including at a September appearance before the New York Economic Club.

“I will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms,” Trump said at the time.

It is unclear how the new department will function once it is established. Tuesday’s statement indicated that Ramaswamy and Musk would “provide advice and guidance from outside of Government”.

Critics note that independent nonpartisan watchdogs already exist within the government to ensure efficiency and conduct audits, including the Government Accountability Office.







Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, however, seems poised to reward two of his most prominent supporters from the private sector.

Musk, a billionaire originally from South Africa, is the founder of the electric car company Tesla, the owner of X and the leader of SpaceX, a rocket-building company.

Ramaswamy, meanwhile, is the founder of a pharmaceutical company. Earlier this year, he competed against Trump in the Republican primary season, only to drop out after finishing fourth in January’s Iowa caucus. He immediately endorsed Trump after suspending his campaign.

Musk’s endorsement came months later, after Trump faced an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.

Posting a video of a blood-streaked Trump, Muskwrotein the aftermath, “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.”

Musk has since donated millions of dollars to Trump’s election campaign and made public appearances with him, including at a follow-up rally in Butler.

Since Trump won the November 5 presidential election, Musk has also been a constant presence at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.

DOGE, the acronym for the newly created department, is also the name of thecryptocurrencythat Musk promotes.







Since his first successful presidential bid in 2016, Trump has pledged to slim down the government and “drain the swamp” – his catchphrase for ridding Washington, DC, of unnecessary bureaucracy and corruption.

In Tuesday’s announcement, Trump teased “drastic change” in his second term. He has already pledged to shut down the Department of Education, which distributes federal aid, cracks down on discrimination in schools and publishes research about educational attainment.

A future Department of Government Efficiency, Trump explained, would partner with the White House to “drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.”

Musk at one point suggested he could find more than$2 trillion in savingsif given the power to review federal functions – a sum equivalent to nearly a third of the government’s total annual spending.

To illustrate the scale and importance of his proposed department, Trump drew a comparison between the new body and a World War II-era programme that developed the atomic bomb.

“It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,” Trump said on Tuesday.

Musk was quoted in Trump’s press release celebrating the department’s imminent creation.

“This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/13/trump-names-musk-and-ramaswamy-to-head-new-government-efficiency-department
Elon musk,What is Elon Musk’s ‘everything app’ and what can it learn from China?,"Elon Musk has indicated his desire to transform X, the microblogging site formerly known as Twitter, into an “everything app”.

In a post explaining his decision to dump the Twitter name and bird logo last week, Musk said the rebranded platform would be expanded to offer “comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world”.

Musk’s plans appear to take inspiration from the Chinese super app WeChat.

WeChat, which combines social media, digital payments, internet browsing and more into a single app, has become a ubiquitous part of daily life in China since its launch by tech giant Tencent in 2011.

WeChat was successful in China for a variety of reasons, but key among them was the timing of the launch.

In 2011, China only had 485 million internet users in a population of 1.3 billion people due to limited infrastructure and a large rural populous. The country also had limited credit card penetration, with many people relying heavily on cash. The highest denomination at the time was 100 renminbi, worth roughly $13.

Enter WeChat and similar rival apps that allowed users to access payment services and other features on their mobile phones. Chinese users could suddenly “leapfrog” the era of desktop broadband straight into smartphones and apps, said Kendra Schaeffer, Head of Tech Policy Research at Trivium China.

“[WeChat] filled a social economic contextual need. Simply picking that up and replicating it here isn’t necessarily going to work,” Schaeffer told Al Jazeera, referring to the chances of success for an “everything app” in the United States given the country’s very different internet landscape.

The US internet ecosystem in 2023 is much larger and more fragmented than China’s in 2011.

The market is also far more competitive. Musk’s super app will have to contend with the likes of TikTok, which wants to launch an e-commerce business in the US, and the ubiquity of Google Pay and Apple Pay after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Schaeffer said Musk will need to find a way to integrate a payment platform into his super app – the “secret sauce for success” – if he wants his app to succeed. This would free up users from clicking on third-party links, but such integration has so far eluded US developers.

“Chinese apps as a whole had figured something out and have executed on one particular thing that no US apps have ever done. None of the big US platforms have managed it, which is containing payment and shopping features in a social platform. We just haven’t succeeded at that,” Schaeffer said.

Super apps like WeChat have succeeded in part thanks to the support of the Chinese state – a powerful force that is difficult to match in a US or Western context.

Beijing has banned foreign platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and endorsed local apps like WeChat that lend themselves well to social control and government censorship.

Most Chinese government departments and local authorities operate WeChat accounts as a way to disseminate information – which recently included a call for citizens to join counter-espionage efforts and report suspicious activity.

“Few things survived the fad of Chinese digital transformation, but super-apps like WeChat integrate well with the state’s ambition of organising all aspects of the citizen’s life for political control,” Kitsch Liao, an assistant director of the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told Al Jazeera.

Musk’s ownership of the social media platform once known as Twitter has been tumultuous.

After purchasing Twitter for $44bn last year, Musk fired more than three-quarters of the company’s employees and introduced changes to moderation that have been blamed for a rise in hate speech on the platform and an exodus of advertisers. The company’s subscription-based Twitter Blue service has struggled to attract subscribers, while the rebrand to X has been widely panned.

Last month, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX admitted the company’s advertising revenue had plunged about 50 percent and cash flow was negative, despite earlier predictions the company would break even by this year.

As Musk tries to take X to the next level, there are technical challenges to consider, too.

Musk will need to figure out how a presumably US-based super app would work on the back end, said Liao, including handling issues such as currency choice, consumer data protection and privacy – especially if the app were to operate on a global scale like Twitter.

US tech giants such as Meta and Google have already landed in hot water in the European Union over consumer data protection concerns and anticompetitive practices.

It is unclear whether Musk’s “everything app” would only launch in the US or take on multiple regions at the same time. WeChat has limited use outside China and has the advantage of only having to answer to one government in Beijing.

“It has not been made very clear amongst all these concerns that this is a promising or viable model for the more liberal and consumer-rights oriented Western markets,” Liao said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/8/3/what-is-elon-musks-everything-app-and-what-can-it-learn-from-china
Elon musk,"Elon Musk’s wars: Brazil to Australia, UK to US, the X owner’s many battles","Throughout history, the world’s richest people — almost all men — have often operated from the shadows, taking on governments they don’t like quietly.

Not the world’s current richest man.









In recent months, Elon Musk has taken on government after government, mostly left or liberal administrations, in public online wars centred around his claim that they are curbing free speech. But often, the spats have also come amid attempts by governments to regulate social media — where Musk, the owner of X, has a direct business interest as well.

From Brazil to Australia, France to the United Kingdom, and of course the United States, here’s a look at the battles Musk has stirred, and how they’ve played out for him and his companies.

Latin America’s largest nation and economy banned X in August after Musk refused to comply with a court order to appoint a legal representative in Brazil.

The court had also ordered X to block a series of far-right accounts. Musk had rejected that demand too, clashing publicly with Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.

But the judge didn’t back down either. In addition to the ban, he ordered X to pay more than $3m in fines. The court also froze the Brazilian bank accounts of Starlink, Musk’s satellite communications firm.

Then, on the judge’s order, the Brazilian government transferred $1.3m from X’s local bank account and $2m from Starlink’s local bank account to settle the fine.

Musk first tried to circumvent the ban: for a brief period last week, X was online again in Brazil, after the social media platform rewired how its servers are accessed. But de Moraes threatened it with a daily fine for flouting the ban, and X soon went dark again.

Eventually, the multi-billionaire appears to have accepted defeat — at least for now. Last week, X’s lawyers told the Brazilian Supreme Court that the company would appoint a legal representative in the country and block the accounts accused of spreading hate speech and disinformation in its bid to get X available in the country again.

There is plenty at stake: Brazil is X’s third-largest market with 21 million users.

Across the Pacific Ocean from Brazil, Musk described the Australian government as “fascists” in an X post after its centre-left Labor Party administration announced legislation that would fine media platforms 5 percent of global revenue for spreading information that is “reasonably verifiable as false, misleading or deceptive and reasonably likely to cause or contribute to serious harm”.

“Misinformation and disinformation pose a serious threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy. Doing nothing and allowing this problem to fester is not an option,” Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said last week.

Musk’s argument, again – that the law goes against the principle of free speech.

Musk isn’t the only critic of the new legislation. David Coleman, shadow minister of communications, had concerns too.

“In this bill, if you’re an academic, something you say basically can’t be misinformation. But if you’re an ordinary Australian who disagrees with an academic, it can be misinformation,” Coleman said last week.

But the Australian government has in turn accused Musk of being inconsistent on the matter of free speech. The X owner, his critics say, has accepted calls from right-wing or authoritarian governments to crack down on many accounts.

“Elon Musk’s had more positions on free speech than the Kama Sutra. You know, when it’s, in its commercial interests, he is the champion of free speech and when it doesn’t like it, he is, you know, he’s going to shut it all down,” Government Services Minister Bill Shorten said in an interview on Nine Network’s Today breakfast show.

Last month, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport after arriving from Azerbaijan. According to Paris authorities, he was arrested and then detained due to failure to regulate alleged drug trafficking, organised crime, “terrorism” and fraud on his online messaging platform.

Musk, in a series of X posts, criticised the arrest. In a sarcastic post, replying to the breaking story of Durov’s arrest, he wrote, “POV: It’s 2030 in Europe and you’re being executed for liking a meme”.

POV: It’s 2030 in Europe and you’re being executed for liking a memehttps://t.co/OkZ6YS3u2P

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)August 24, 2024



He posted a #FreePavel on X several hours after Durov’s arrest.

Musk later took to X to criticise fellow multi-billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, responding to a post questioning why the Meta CEO hasn’t faced legal consequences for allegations similar to those against Durov.

Russia, where Durov was born, imposed a ban on Telegram in 2018 after the app refused to comply with a court mandate requiring it to provide access to its encryption keys. However, the ban was eventually lifted in 2020.

Early in August, Musk ensnared himself in another war of words on X, this time with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, after far-right and anti-immigration riots across Britain.

Responding to a post suggesting that mass migration and open borders were to blame for the riots, Musk posted: “Civil war is inevitable”.

The UK government hit back. “There’s no justification for comments like that,” a spokesperson for Starmer told reporters. “What we’ve seen in this country is organised, violent thuggery that has no place, either on our streets or online. We’re talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain … I think you can tell from that that the prime minister does not share those sentiments.”

Musk would further antagonise Starmer with yet another X post, with the hashtag #TwoTierKier — a term popularised by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage — implying that people on the far right are policed more heavily than those on the left.

Why aren’t all communities protected in Britain?@Keir_Starmerhttps://t.co/gldyguysNe

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)August 6, 2024



London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley pushed back on Musk’s comments in an interview with Sky News, saying, “We have commentators from either end of the political spectrum who like to throw accusations of bias at the police because we stand in the middle, we operate independently under the law without fear or favour … The serious voices who echo those are of more concern to me because the risk is … they legitimise the violence that the officers I’m sending [out] today, will face on the streets … they are putting them at risk.”

Musk said earlier he voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, but ahead of the 2024 election, he has made clear that he backs former President Donald Trump.

On X, he has called Biden a “damp sock puppet”, and criticised the president’s policies on immigration and health.

In November 2023, after a Musk post where he appeared to blame Jews for mass immigration into the US, the White House described his comments as “abhorrent”, “racist” and “anti-Semitic”.

But he has also worked with the US government to provide Starlink satellite access to Ukraine amid its war with Russia — though in recent months, Kyiv has alleged that Moscow’s forces too have accessed the service via third countries.

Most recently, following the second alleged assassination attempt on Trump, an X account user asked: “Why [do] they want to kill Donald Trump?”

In a now-deleted post, Musk responded, “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.”

The comment drew a firestorm of criticism for Musk, including from the White House.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/24/elon-musks-wars-brazil-to-australia-uk-to-us-the-x-owners-many-battles
Elon musk,"What is Elon Musk’s Neuralink brain chip, now being tested on humans?","A year after being cleared for the test, billionaire Elon Musk’s Neuralink has implanted its wireless brain chip in a human for the first time.

Musk announced that the patient received the implant on Sunday and “is recovering well”. The device is meant to have several applications, from restoring motor functionality within people to enabling a brain-computer interface. There was no independent verification of Musk’s claims, and Neuralink did not offer too many details.

Musk has touted Neuralink as the future of technology and medicine, but ethical concerns have been raised around the chip and its testing.

Here is what you need to know about Neuralink and its human testing.

Neuralink is a brain-chip startup founded by Musk in 2016.

A device the size of a coin is surgically implanted in the skull, with ultra-thin wires going into the brain and developing a brain-computer interface (BCI).

The disk would register brain activity and send it over to a device, such as smartphone, through a common Bluetooth connection.

The first product, called Telepathy, would allow people to control their phones or computers “just by thinking”, said Musk.

Planting the chip in the part of the brain that controls motor function would also enable people to overcome neurological disorders, the company claims.

Musk said that initial users would be those who have lost the use of their limbs.

Thehuman testing phasewill collect data on safety and effectiveness, while helping improve the device.

Musk said on X on Monday that the “initial results show promising neuron spike detection”. This means that neurons are sending electrical and chemical signals to each other around the body. Such activity allows us to carry out our everyday functions from eating to talking.

When Neuralink initially started searching for trial participants in September, it was looking for individuals with diseases of the spinal cord, a key part of the body’s nervous system.

The US Food and Drug Administrationapproved human trialsin May 2023 amid federal probes into the safety of its trials on animals.

The first human received an implant from@Neuralinkyesterday and is recovering well.

Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.

Neuralink has tested out its chip on monkeys and pigs.

The company showed several monkeys “playing” basic video games or moving a cursor on a screen through their Neuralink implants.

Although Neuralink says no monkeys died as a result of their implants, there have been reports of issues with the implants on monkeys, including paralysis, seizures and brain swelling.

There are some 40 brain-computer interface trials under way, according to an online database of active clinical trials in the United States.

Australia-based company Synchron implanted its device in a US patient in July 2022. Synchron’s implant does not require cutting into the skull for installation.

Other trials target medical needs while Musk’s company goes beyond that, aiming to allow people to control their smartphones and devices.

Experts have raised concerns around the experimentation of Neuralink’s brain chip on animals, as well as potential risks associated with brain surgery, such as brain haemorrhage or seizures.

They add that Musk’s vision of implants raises privacy and surveillance concerns. Scant details have been available on users’ ability to retain control of their personal data and neural activity.

Earlier this year, the US Department of Transportation fined Neuralink for failing to register itself as a transporter of hazardous material — implants from the brains of primates — according to records from the federal agency reviewed by Reuters.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/what-is-elon-musks-neuralink-brain-chip-now-being-tested-on-humans
Elon musk,Elon Musk faces off with Saudi Prince Talal over Twitter sale,"Elon Musk has questioned Saudi Arabia’s role in Twitter Inc after Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal tweeted his opposition to the billionaire entrepreneur’soffer to buythe social media company.

The prince tweeted on Thursday from his verified account that Musk’s offer of a $43bn cash takeover of the company does not come close to the “intrinsic value” of Twitter.

“Being one of the largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter,@Kingdom_KHC& I reject this offer,” the prince said, referring to the Saudi Arabia-based Kingdom Holding Company, which he owns.

The prince also shared a 2015 tweet, in which he wrote that his company’s ownership stake in Twitter had risen to 5.2 percent.

Musk, who owns 9.2 percent of Twitter, responded to the tweet, asking how much of Twitter, directly and indirectly, was owned by Saudi Arabia.

“What are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech?” Musk added.

The tech billionaire has said he wants to take Twitter private to help it grow and to make it a platform for free speech.

I don't believe that the proposed offer by@elonmusk($54.20) comes close to the intrinsic value of@Twittergiven its growth prospects.

— الوليد بن طلال (@Alwaleed_Talal)April 14, 2022



Twitter users and human rights activists were quick to latch on to the billionaire’s questions, with the United States-based Freedom Initiative highlighting the story of Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, who wassentenced to 20 yearsin prison by a Saudi court over his tweets.

“Freedom of speech in the Kingdom? Here’s what happens to young aid workers in Saudi Arabia when they make satirical Twitter accounts,” the group wrote.

As of January, Saudi Arabia, with a population of 34.8 million, had the eighth most Twitter users of any country in the world, with more than 12 million users.

However, Saudi Arabia does not permit independent media, is regularly accused of crackdowns on dissent, and allegedly closely monitors Saudi journalists who live abroad, with US intelligencedirectly linkingSaudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul in 2018.

In 2019, the US Justice Departmentcharged two former Twitter employeeswith using their roles at the company to obtain information on US citizens and Saudi dissidents who were critical of the kingdom’s policies.

On Thursday, Musk responded to a tweet with a link to a New York Times report on those arrests, tweeting a monocle emoji.

For his part, Musk’s bid to buy Twitter has sparked concerns over how he would transform the company, particularly when it comes to what many consider to beimportant safeguardsto combat misinformation that have been implemented on the platform.

Musk has been among the most vocal opponents of what critics call censorship on the site.

“Disturbing to think that a Saudi Prince and Elon Musk are basically the two people determining the future of a global communications platform,” Marc Owen Jones, an assistant professor of Middle East studies at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, wrote on Twitter.

On Thursday, Twitter said it would “carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders”.

Musk, who is worth about $273.6bn, according to a Forbes tally, had previously rejected an offer to join Twitter’s board on Saturday after disclosing his stake, a move analysts said signalled his takeover intentions as a board seat would have limited his shareholding to just below 15 percent.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/15/musk-faces-off-with-saudi-prince-talal-over-bid-to-buy-twitter
Elon musk,Elon Musk-led group makes $97.4bn bid for OpenAI,"A consortium led by Elon Musk said it has offered $97.4bn to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, months afterthe billionaire suedthe artificial intelligence startup to block it from transitioning to a for-profit firm.

Musk’s bid, revealed on Monday, could ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology.

Altman promptly posted on X: “No thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”

The two are already embroiled in an ongoing lawsuit.Musk criticiseda $500bn OpenAI-led project called Stargate announced with great fanfare at the White House just after United States President Donald Trump returned to office, suggesting the investors involved lacked the funding for the project.

“It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,” Musk said in the press release. “We will make sure that happens.”

OpenAI, Musk, Musk’s lawyer Marc Toberoff and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Reuters news agency.

The bid is being backed by Musk’s AI company xAI, which could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported Musk’s offer earlier on Monday.

Even without any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds.

OpenAI was valued at $157bn in its latest funding round in October, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40bn in OpenAI at a valuation of $300bn, including the new funds, the Reuters news agency reported in January.

Musk co-founded OpenAI with Altman in 2015, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023.

OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best artificial intelligence models.

Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/10/elon-musk-led-group-makes-97-4bn-bid-for-openai
Elon musk,Elon Musk’s X to shut operations in Brazil amid bitter legal fight,"Social media giant X has announced it will shutter its operations in Brazil followinga legal tusslewith a top Brazilian judge over the platform’s rights and responsibilities to counter disinformation.

The platform, previously known as Twitter, said on Saturday the shutdown was “effective immediately” but that Brazilian users would still have access to X.

“We are deeply saddened that we have been forced to make this decision,” the company said, adding that responsibility for the decision “lies solely” with Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes.

The move is the apparent culmination of a continuing legal battle between Moraes, who has said he is trying to fight the spread of disinformation online, and Elon Musk,the billionaire owner of X.

Earlier this year, Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts accused of spreading false news and hate messages, including some belonging to supporters of Brazil’s formerfar-right President Jair Bolsonaro.

Bolsonaro repeatedly peddled false claims that Brazil’s electronic voting system was vulnerable to fraud before a tightly contested 2022 election.

Months after he was defeated by left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a mob of Bolsonaro’ssupporters stormedthe top state institutions in the South American country in anger over the results.

“Freedom of expression doesn’t mean freedom of aggression,” Moraes, who presides over Brazil’s Superior Electoral Tribunal, has said.

“It doesn’t mean the freedom to defend tyranny.”

Due to demands by “Justice”@Alexandrein Brazil that would require us to break (in secret) Brazilian, Argentinian, American and international law, 𝕏 has no choice but to close our local operations in Brazil.

He is an utter disgrace to justice.https://t.co/yAvX1TpuRp

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)August 17, 2024



On Saturday, X claimed Moraes secretly threatened one of the company’s legal representatives in Brazil with arrest if it did not comply with legal orders to take down some content from its platform.

The social media giant published pictures of a document allegedly signed by Moraes that says a daily fine of 20,000 reais ($3,653) and an arrest decree would be imposed against X representative Rachel Nova Conceicao if the platform did not fully comply with Moraes’s orders.

Brazil’s Supreme Court told the Reuters news agency that it would not speak on the matter and would not confirm nor deny the authenticity of the document shared by X.

In a separate social media post on Saturday, Musk called Moraes “an utter disgrace to justice”.

“The decision to close the X office in Brazil was difficult,” said Musk, adding that if the company had agreed to the judge’s orders, “there was no way we could explain our actions without being ashamed.”

Moraesopened an inquiryearlier this year into the billionaire after Musk said he would reactivate accounts on X that the judge had ordered blocked.

After Musk’s challenges, X representatives reversed course and told Brazil’s Supreme Court that the social media giant would comply with the legal rulings.

Lawyers representing X in Brazil in April told the Supreme Court that “operational faults” have allowed users who were ordered blocked to stay active on the platform, after Moraes had asked X to explain why it allegedly had not fully complied with his decisions.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/17/elon-musks-x-to-shut-operations-in-brazil-amid-bitter-legal-fight
Elon musk,US Election 2024,"For months, Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, has been pushing for a department to slash United States government spending.

On November 12,President-elect Donald Trumpmade his wish come true and announced that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and failed Republican presidential candidate, would lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

DOGE appears to be an outside advisory department that will work in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a White House office in charge of helping the sitting president craft budget proposals to bring to Congress. Musk gave the department official government credentials onX,the social media platform he owns.

“From everything we’ve heard now, what Elon and Vivek are proposing to do would be something similar to what the Office of Management and Budget and GAO [Government Accountability Office] does. OMB serves the president specifically to help manage federal agencies across the executive branch. Anything that goes to the president has to go through OMB first. Anything that comes from the president to other agencies has to go through OMB first,” a former senior Trump administration official who declined to be named told Al Jazeera.

Regardless, it would not be an official cabinet position, which would require the formation of a new government agency, which would require congressional approval. The most recent agency to be created was the Department of Homeland Security, which opened its doors in 2003 in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.

Musk has promised to cut $2 trillion, or more than a third, of the US government’s annual budget. He said he wants to cut thenumber of agencies from 428 to 99.

Last week, hesharedon X an old interview with Milton Friedman in which the economist lists the government departments that should be scrapped – agriculture, education, commerce – adding, “Milton Friedman was the best,” a post that is being read as things Musk would like to do.







Ramaswamy, who will co-lead the office, said he wants to cut 75 percent of the federal government workforce. The federal government employs roughly 2 million civilians. A 75 percent reduction would mean that 1.5 million people would be out of a job, which, experts said, will strip down a range of services from food stamps to defence spending.

To boost the effort, Trump ally and Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been picked to lead a DOGE subcommittee in the House of Representatives, in which she is to outline plans to fire government employees. The subcommittee has yet to be created.

Musk has acknowledged that the move would create temporary hardships but said it is for long-term prosperity.

“There are a lot of questions that are brought up by his stated goal of streamlining the government and by some of the metrics that he’s put out. [And that’s] before he’s done any of his initial analysis,” Ann Skeet, senior director of leadership ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California, told Al Jazeera.

This week, Musk singled out specific government employees, questioning their jobs to his 205 million followers on X, The Wall Street Journal reported, many of whom then followed up with tweets targeting those people.

Musk has oversimplified government programmes to make them sound ridiculous and worthy of cuts but has ignored why these programmes exist.He slammed, for instance, research in which the US government spent $4.5m to spray alcoholic rats with bobcat urine. However, this is part of a bigger research study into the relationship between alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder, a common issue among military veterans and one the research is trying to find treatment for.

Musk’s willingness to make cuts “just speaks to an arrogance that because you’ve been successful in one domain, that doesn’t mean he can be successful in another domain”, Skeet said.

Musk and Ramaswamy argued that Trump will be able to cut government jobs unilaterally under a policy called Schedule F, an executive order that Trump signed during his first term and never went into effect. It would have reclassified civilian civil servants as at will employees who serve at the pleasure of the president, similar to a political appointment like a cabinet secretary. It would strip job protections from these employees.

Musk has a long record of firing people who are necessary to key functions of his companies, including during his takeover of Twitter when he laid off half its employees, a move that led to systemic failures across the company. As a result of his decisions, the company is now valued at 80 percent less than when he took it over.







Musk has tweeted that DOGE is looking to hire people with high IQs who are willing to work 80 hours a week for no money and will need to buy a subscription to X to apply.

Skeet warned that a skeleton staff manning the federal government “will impact how consumers will interact with the government – whether or not airplanes will be safe to fly and cars will be regulated in the correct way and sort of just will people get their tax returns on time”.

Musk’s appointment is until July 4, 2026, in conjunction with the country’s 250th birthday, according to a Trump team press release. That is also only a few months before midterm elections.

Musk’s appointment comes with significant conflicts of interest. He has claimed onXthat his businesses were “smothered by bureaucracy” and DOGE would address that.

Musk’s businesses have billions of dollars in government contracts. SpaceX alone received $3.8bn in government contracts in the 2024 fiscal year, most of which was work for NASA and the Department of Defense, according to government data.







Those contracts include building the propulsion systems NASA uses while another contract is to use Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet service provider, to first responders during weather events like the floods in North Carolina.

While SpaceX has the lion’s share of government contracts among Musk’s companies, some of his other firms also earn money from the US government, including Tesla.

In the 2024 fiscal year, Tesla had $6m of government contracts. NASA and the Department of Commerce are the largest awarding agencies for the electric vehicle giant.

“Having somebody who is a beneficiary of government decision-making, you know, in a role to decide which parts of government to streamline, is somebody who is fundamentally conflicted,” Skeet said.

Musk’s conflicts of interest do not just stem from federal contracts but also agencies either investigating or sanctioning him and his businesses. As the co-head of this new agency, he would be in charge of coming up with financial policy decisions that could impact their future funding.

One agency where Musk faces fines and investigations is the National Labor Relations Board, which investigates allegations of union busting and workforce harm. Musk faced complaints for his actions in the overhaul of Twitter, including lawsuits from employees he fired.

Musk also faces a complaint lodged by the United Auto Workers union after his interview with then-candidate Trump in which the two joked about firing striking workers. That case is still open.

The National Transportation Safety Board has pending investigations against Tesla on its self-driving cars, which have been involved in crashes, including one that killed a pedestrian in Arizona in 2023.

Musk also has conflicts with the Department of Justice (DOJ), which has been trying to access all data and records pertaining to Trump’s X account as recently as last month as it investigates Trump’s role in the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol by his supporters.

Before the November elections, Musk was also accused of breaking federal election laws by the DOJ for a$1m daily giveawayconducted by his political action committee.

In recent days, Senate Democrats haveraised concernsabout Musk’s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin as early as 2022 and his sustained connections with high-level Russian officials, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. They have asked the DOJ to determine if Musk should be barred from future involvement in space contracts.



There are other areas of potential conflicts.

During President Joe Biden’s administration, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) awarded Starlink an $885m contract to provide access to rural America, but it was later revoked because the FCC didn’t think Starlink could provide the service. Musk slammed the decision as politically biased.

Now Trump has picked Musk ally Brenden Carr to lead the commission. Carr is the top Republican on the FCC, who disagreed with the decision to deny Starlink the contract. He also wrote the chapter on the FCC in the conservative policy playbook for a second Trump term, Project 2025.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is also a thorn in Musk’s side. As recently as September, the agency planned to sanction him for not showing up to testify for a second time over his acquisition of Twitter and rejected his proposal to pay a $2,923 fine for missing the deposition.

But arguably, Musk’s conflicts of interest are neither unique to him nor are they new to Washington.

Last year, an investigative report from the outlet Insider found that 78 members of Congress had not properly disclosed personal financial trades, which is required by law. The law is meant to combat issues like insider trading.

Musk did not say whether he would divest before joining the government or serve as an outside adviser. He also did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for clarification.

At the same time, some of Trump’s policies might also negatively impact Musk.

“From everything that President Trump has said, it sounds like he will be very tough on China, which will then serve Elon Musk poorly. He gets a lot of his materials that he needs for his different companies from China,” the former senior Trump administration official who spoke to Al Jazeera said.

Tesla, for example, reportedly gets roughly 40 percent of its materials from China. Trump’s proposed tariffs on the country could be as high as 60 percent.

In case the tariffs do kick in, “I don’t think it’s all necessarily going to be good for Elon as an adviser,” the official added.

Given all of these factors, can Musk actually serve as head of DOGE under his current arrangements with Tesla, X and SpaceX?

Ethics experts suggested they should be disqualifying.

“What’s happening here is problematic. Elon Musk has built-in obvious conflicts of interest because the companies that he is associated with have relationships with the very government that he is now going to come in and try to make more efficient,” Skeet said.

Legal experts, however, said it’s a bit more of an open question.

Advisory committees whether for a federal agency or the president fall under a specific law that requires they make public their actions and meetings so the public can participate, explained Kedric Payne, vice president, general counsel and senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center. But “it’s not clear that [DOGE] will fall under those transparency requirements of the law that applies to most advisory committees,” he said.

That law is called the Federal Advisory Committee Act and requires that nongovernmental experts who provide federal agencies with advice publicly disclose their recommendations. Musk said on X he woulddo that.

“In most situations where an official has a conflict of interest, there is a rule that can be enforced to stop that conflict of interest. In this situation, it is not clear yet whether or not there are any rules that could prohibit these conflicts,” Payne said.

But with few specifics on how DOGE will be set up, there’s not a lot that can be said about the legal options, Payne pointed out.

The Trump transition team, which did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment, has publicly said it is compliant with all laws.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/11/25/what-do-elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamy-plan-to-do-with-doge
Elon musk,Why is Elon Musk clashing with the UK government over far-right riots?,"Elon Musk has clashed with United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer on X, accusing the British leader of discriminatory “two-tiered” policing as authorities scramble to clamp down on violent far-right riots against Muslims and immigrants that have rocked the country for a week.

The posts came after 10 Downing Street on Monday criticised earlier comments by the billionaire and technology entrepreneur on his X platform, saying that Musk “does not speak for Britain”.

Musk, who also owns rocket company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, has since doubled down, picking on the prime minister while appearing to voice support for the protesting far-right groups.

Hundreds of rioters have been arrested in the wake of violence that first started in the northern English town of Southport and has spread across England and Northern Ireland. Scores of police officers have been wounded in the violence.

Here’s a breakdown of the row between Musk and the UK government:

On Sunday, Musk tweeted that “civil war is inevitable,” in the UK, in response to a post claiming that “open borders and migration” had led to the protests.

The anti-migration narrative that is being spread on social channels has been blamed for sparking the disorder in the first place, after misinformation spread online that a 17-year-old suspect who killed three girls in a mass stabbing in Southport was a Muslim immigrant. That claim has since been debunked, as the suspect is confirmed to have been born in the UK.

The UK government condemned the post on Monday.

“There’s no justification for comments like that,” a spokesperson for Starmer told reporters. “What we’ve seen in this country is organised, violent thuggery that has no place, either on our streets or online. We’re talking about a minority of thugs that do not speak for Britain … I think you can tell from that that the prime minister does not share those sentiments.”

However, Musk only appears to be doubling down on his criticism of the UK government since 10 Downing Street’s rebuke.

The billionaire has since Monday retweeted or commented under posts attacking UK authorities for arresting and charging suspects arrested for taking part in the riots.

In one response to a post that claimed that an “armed Muslim” patrol group had attacked civilians and a news network crew, Musk directly tweeted at Prime Minister Starmer, asking: “Why aren’t all communities protected?”

Musk has also tweeted in support of those attacking officials for arresting people believed to have posted offensive comments online, espousing a “free speech absolutist” stance he has long pushed. He posted a meme of a cartoon character strapped to an electrocution chair and likened the scene to the punishment people would face for posting their views online in the UK by 2030.

“Is this Britain or the Soviet Union?” he asked in yet another tweet.

“Musk and others would claim … the right of free speech and for people to say what they want, but there is a very thin line here,” Lee McGowan, a professor studying far-right groups at Belfast’s Queen’s University, told Al Jazeera.

“These influencers are channelling hate. In Belfast, we have seen some shops attacked even where the owners – who are paying taxes and contributing to society – and are legally entitled to be here, have had their premises attacked and burnt out.”

Musk further tweeted the hashtag #TwoTierKeir, referencing controversial theories being spread that claim authorities are cracking down more severely on the protesting groups than on minorities.

London Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley told Sky News on Wednesday that the claim was “complete nonsense”.

“We have commentators from either end of the political spectrum who like to throw accusations of bias at the police because we stand in the middle, we operate independently under the law without fear or favour…The serious voices who echo those are of more concern to me because the risk is … they legitimise the violence that the officers I’m sending (out) today, will face on the streets … they are putting them at risk.”

UK authorities have not responded directly to Musk’s provocative comments since Monday. UK newspaper The Guardian reports that parliament members of the ruling Labour Party were privately warned not to engage Musk.

It is “important that you do not do anything that risks amplifying misinformation on social media and do not get drawn into debates online,” Chief Whip Alan Campbell is quoted as saying in a letter to Labour MPs.

It’s not easy to draw a direct cause-and-effect association between Musk’s inciting tweets on the riots, and the intensity of the violence, however, on his platform X, many of Musk’s posts have received thousands of likes and reposts, hinting at how widely they’ve travelled.

It’s the exact scenario that UK authorities fear after Starmer blameddisinformation on social mediafor the riots. Indeed, figures like the influencer Andrew Tate stirred up the anti-immigrant rhetoric that contributed to the violence. In a video on X, Tate had said the 17-year-old suspect who attacked the girls in Southport was an “undocumented migrant” who had “arrived on a boat”.

According to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a surge in online activity regarding misinformation surrounding the stabbing suspect helped far-right networks mobilise offline and enabled them to organise protests outside a local mosque in Southport. Authorities say the far-right English Defence League organised the protests.

Some of the present agitations have roots that go back as far as Brexit, McGowan of Queen’s University said, noting that many of the communities experiencing violence are also the poorer ones where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, believing it would solve economic declines.

“There are real issues here over jobs, houses and the future. Brexit was supposed to bring a new dawn. So anti-immigrant views became more pronounced and immigrants were portrayed by far-right groups as a problem. They paint a picture of new arrivals taking houses, jobs, getting preferential treatment to education and social security,” he said.

The previous Tory government’s anti-immigrant andanti-Islam rhetoricduring its 14-year tenure also played a role in far-right violence, analysts say. Starmer’s predecessor Rishi Sunakunsuccessfully deviseda plan to deport immigrants to Rwanda.

Starmer promised to crack down hard on protesters and posters. Close to 400 people have been arrested so far, with some reportedly charged with posting inciteful comments online.

On Tuesday, a 28-year-old man in the city of Leeds appeared in court on allegations of using “threatening words or behaviour intending to stir up racial hatred” in alleged Facebook posts.

The man, named as Jordan Parlour by UK media, is the first to be charged for online posts related to the riots. Parlour pleaded guilty to the charges and will be sentenced on Friday.

Musk has similarly tweeted in support of right-wing narratives in the United States on issues like immigration.

Following Republican Candidate Donald Trump’s attempted assassination in July, Musk publicly endorsed Trump, who is staunchly anti-immigration, and champions policies such as anti-abortion rights.

“I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk tweeted.

Musk also announced he would be donating to Trump’s re-election bid. In the past, Musk had donated to both Democrats and Republicans, including to former President Barack Obama in 2011.

On Tuesday, Trump posted on his Truth Social social media platform that he had agreed to be interviewed by Musk but did not provide more details.

Rossman, one of Europe’s largest drugstore chains, on Tuesday announced it would no longer patronise Tesla, citing Musk’s relations with Trump, who has in the past spoken out against climate change and electric vehicles.

Under Musk’s leadership, X, formerly Twitter, has also reinstated the suspended accounts of several controversial figures, including the UK’s Tommy Robinson, an anti-Islam activist, the influencer Tate and Trump. Robinson has particularly been accused of stoking the far-right protests in the UK.

Authorities deployed thousands of police officers across the UK on Wednesday ahead of planned far-right protests that failed to materialise. Thousands of peoplemarched against racismacross the UK in response to the targeting of people of colour, especially Muslims, over the past week.

Meanwhile, online agitations around the protests continue. Some analysts have speculated that the UK government could restrict access to some social channels like Musk’s X.

But that could be problematic, Professor McGowan said.

“Influencers and leading figures could be de-platformed,” he said, but that could bring up questions of whether people are being silenced by the authorities. “(It) feeds into conspiracy theories which are very much alive and well.”

Besides, it has not always worked in the past, as is seen in the United States, in the case of Trump, for example.

“Often pushed people onto (other) sites … tend to post more often and even more extreme comments. The way for the government to proceed is to take on the (social) media companies and start to really make these companies responsible for what appears on their sites. The government needs to have more honest discussions about immigration and its advantages, morals, and how it is seeking to deal with illegal migration,” McGowan added.

Officials are mulling trying some of the suspects on “terrorism” charges.

“…We’ll throw the full force of the law at offenders, whether that’s charging people with assaults, violent disorder, riot and if terrorism offences are appropriate,” Police Commissioner Rowley told Sky News.

“If you are a keyboard warrior, you’re not safe from the law if you incite violence,” he said.

Elon musk,Brazil’s top court threatens to ban Elon Musk’s X,"Brazil’s top court has threatened to ban X unless its billionaire owner Elon Musk names a legal representative in the Latin American country within 24 hours.

Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes said in an order made public on Wednesday that failure to appoint a legal representative could result in the “suspension of the social network’s activities”.

The order is the latest development in a months-long feud between Musk and de Moraes, who has led a crackdown on alleged misinformation and disinformation in the nation of more than 200 million people.

De Moraes has ordered the suspension of more than 100 X accounts in recent years, including some belonging to supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who lost the 2022 election to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after peddling unsubstituted claims that Brazil’s electronic voting machines are prone to fraud.

In April, De Moraes accused Musk of waging a “disinformation campaign” and disrespecting Brazil’s sovereignty after the Tesla CEO decided to stop complying with the court orders to block certain X accounts.

Musk, a self-described free speech absolutist, has accused de Moraes of stifling free speech and violating Brazil’s constitution.

X announced earlier this month it would shut its operations in Brazil, saying de Moraes had threatened one of the company’s legal representatives with arrest if it did not comply with his takedown orders.

The Supreme Court at the time declined to comment on X’s claims.

Right-wing allies of Bolsonaro, who was barred from running for office until 2030 by de Moraes and four other judges over his claims about electronic voting, have accused the top jurist of stepping beyond his authority to suppress his political foes.

De Moraes’s defenders argue his actions have been necessary at a time of rampant disinformation and right-wing threats to democracy.

“Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route,” Musk wrote on Twitter on Saturday.

He was responding to a tweet by a Ukrainian government official who asked Musk to provide the embattled country withStarlink stations.

“@elonmusk, while you try to colonize Mars – Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space – Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people!” Ukraine’s vice prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, said on Twitter.

Internet connectivity in Ukraine has been affected by the Russian invasion, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country where fighting has been heaviest, internet monitors said on Saturday.

While extremely costly to deploy,satellite technologycan provide internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fibre-optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology can also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.

Elon musk,US watchdog sues Elon Musk over late disclosure of Twitter stake,"Elon Musk is being sued by the securities regulator in the United States for allegedly failing to promptly disclose his stake in Twitter before he bought the social media platform.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Tuesday that Musk failed to disclose within the required 10-day period that he acquired more than 5 percent of Twitter’s stock in March 2022.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO’s failure to notify regulators allowed him to keep buying shares at “artificially low prices”, the SEC said in a filing with the US District Court for the District of Columbia.

Musk’s actions ultimately allowed him to “underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his beneficial ownership report was due”, the SEC said.

Musk finally informed regulators that he had acquired more than 9 percent of Twitter’s stock on April 4, 2022, 11 days after the disclosure was due, the SEC said.

Twitter’s stock price on that day was up 27 percent from the previous day’s close, according to the regulator.

“Because Musk failed to timely disclose his beneficial ownership, he was able to make these purchases from the unsuspecting public at artificially low prices, which did not yet reflect the undisclosed material information of Musk’s beneficial ownership of more than five percent of Twitter common stock and investment purpose,” the securities regulator said.

“In total, Musk underpaid Twitter investors by more than $150 million for his purchases of Twitter common stock during this period. Investors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm.”







US securities regulations require investors who buy more than 5 percent of a company’s shares to disclose their stake so shareholders can make informed decisions about investments.

Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment, but was quoted telling media outlets that the lawsuit was a “sham”, a “single-count ticky tak complaint” and part of a “multi-year campaign of harassment” against his client.

The SEC has sued Musk twice before, including over a 2018 Twitter post in which he claimed he had secured funding to possibly take the electric car company Tesla private.

Musk settled that lawsuit by paying a $20m civil fine, agreeing to have some of his social media activity subject to legal review, and relinquishing his role as Tesla’s chairman.

Musk completed his purchase of Twitter in October 2022 for $44bn, after signing an acquisition deal that he subsequently attempted to back out of.

The SEC’s latest enforcement action, which was announced with little fanfare, comes days before Chair Gary Gensler is due to step down on January 20, the day of US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.

It is unclear if the lawsuit against Musk, one of Trump’s most influential allies, will continue under Trump, who has named Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, as Gensler’s successor.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/15/us-watchdog-sues-elon-musk-over-late-disclosure-of-twitter-stake
Elon musk,‘Starbase’: Residents of Texas site home to Musk’s SpaceX back city status,"A community in the southern US state of Texas that is home to tech billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX will be renamed Starbase after residents – nearly all employees of the firm – backed the move to formally organise it into a city.

In a vote on Saturday, 212 of the almost 300 residents eligible to cast ballots were in favour of the change at the site on Boca Chica Bay bordering Mexico, with only six against.

Bobby Peden, who is vice president of testing and launches at SpaceX, was also confirmed as mayor. He was the only name on the ballot.

Official documents show nearly 500 people live around the base in Cameron County, on land mostly owned by SpaceX or its employees.

“Starbase, Texas,” Musk wrote on X, a social media platform he owns, “Is now a real city!”

The vote came at a difficult time for Musk, a majordonorto US President Donald Trump and abackerof European far-right groups. The South African-born entrepreneur is expected to reduce his role as the unofficial head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to instead focus more on his troubled electric car company, Tesla.

It was Musk who proposed the name Starbase in a social media post during a visit to the facility – a key testing location for the company’s rocket launches – four years ago. Then, last December, general manager of SpaceX Kathryn Lueders appealed to local authorities to grant municipality status to the site.

Saturday’s vote was never in doubt, but the change allows Starbase to control building and permitting and avoid other regulatory hurdles, while collecting taxes and writing local law.







However, not everyone has been upbeat about the prospect of a SpaceX town.

Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of the South Texas Environmental Justice Network, was among those voicing concern over the environmental impact, warning of more “destruction”.

“They would attempt more illegal dumping, they would build up their dangerous rocket operations and cause more seismic activity, cause our homes to shake, and that they would destroy more of the wildlife habitat in the region,” she told the AFP news agency before election day.

Some reports in 2024 had also said SpaceX’s rockets had caused damage to wild bird nests. In response, Musk had said on social media at the time: “To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week.”

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas authorities also found that SpaceX was responsible for repeated spills and the release of pollutants into Texas waterways.

Lueders argued in her letter in December that SpaceX already maintained infrastructure such as roads, education services and medical care at the site.

She promised the creation of the new city would not undermine the company’s efforts to mitigate the base’s environmental impact.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/4/starbase-residents-of-texas-site-home-to-musks-spacex-back-city-status
Elon musk,Anti-Musk demonstrators stage ‘Tesla takedowns’ on Global Day of Protest,"Crowdsprotestingbillionaire Elon Musk’s purge of the US government under President Donald Trump have been congregating outside Tesla dealerships throughout the US, and in some cities in Europe, in the latest attempt to put a dent in the enormous fortune of the world’s richest man.

The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk’s role as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he’s gained access to sensitive data and shut down entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending.

Most of Musk’s estimated $340bn fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Trump.

Tesla Takedown has been organised by a group that includes disillusioned owners of the carmaker’s vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Representative Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.

Earlier protests were somewhat sporadic.

But Saturday’s demonstrations mark the first attempt to surround all 277 of the carmaker’s showrooms and service centres in the US in hopes of deepening a recent decline in the company’s sales.

In front of the New York store in Manhattan, between 500 and 1,000 people gathered, demanding Musk’s resignation from government.

The protesters were gathered at the call of environmentalists from Planet Over Profit, who believe that “stopping Musk will save lives and protect our democracy.”

For Amy Neifeld, a 70-year-old American psychologist who had not taken to the streets since the anti-Vietnam War protests in the 1970s, Elon Musk is leading the United States towards “fascism”.

“I’m Jewish and I grew up with a deep awareness of what fascism is. And it’s only gotten worse since the election” of Donald Trump, she told the AFP news agency.

“We have to do something very quickly, because he’s moving very quickly,” Neifeld added.

In London, about two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.

One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute — a gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Trump’s January 20 inauguration.

A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk’s straight-arm gesture that said, “You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don’t buy a Swasticar.”

“We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we’re facing,” Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest told The Associated Press.

Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set Tesla vehicles on fire and committed other acts of vandalism that US Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as “domestic terrorism”. Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should “stop acting psycho”.

Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance of Saturday’s protests to remain peaceful.

But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was not immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.

Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk allied himself with Trump have been looking to sell or trade in their cars, while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire’s efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.

But Musk did not appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company’s Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain “the best-selling car on Earth again this year.”

Elon musk,"Elon Musk deletes post about Harris, Biden assassination after backlash","Tech billionaire Elon Musk has deleted a social media post about the lack of assassination attempts on United States President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris following widespread criticism.

In the wake of a second apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Sunday, Musk wrote in a post on X that “no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala” along with an emoji of a face with a raised eyebrow.

The chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who has emerged as an outspoken Trump supporter in recent months, wrote the post in response to another X user questioning why people were trying to kill the Republican candidate.

Musk later wrote that the post had been a joke.

“Well, one lesson I’ve learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn’t mean it’s going to be all that hilarious as a post on X,” Musk wrote.

“Turns out that jokes are WAY less funny if people don’t know the context and the delivery is plain text,” he said in a follow-up post.

South Africa-born Musk’s post sparked backlash from across the political spectrum, with “DeportElonMusk” trending on X at one point on Monday.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates condemned Musk’s comments as “irresponsible.”

“As President Biden and Vice President Harris said after yesterday’s disturbing news, ‘there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country’ and ‘we all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence’,” Bates in a statement.

“Violence should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about.”

Musk, who is regularly ranked as the world’s richest man, formally endorsed Trump for the 2024 election in July after the Republican candidate narrowly survived an attempted assassination by a gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Earlier this month, Trump announced that he would appoint Musk to lead a “government efficiency commission” if he regains the White House in November.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/9/17/elon-musk-deletes-post-about-harris-biden-assassination-after-backlash
Elon musk,"Elon Musk under investigation, Twitter Inc says in court filing","Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is under investigation by United States federal authorities for his handlingof a $44bn deal to take over Twitter Inc, the social media company has said in a court filing.

Twitter Inc’s court filing, which was released on Thursday, said that Musk was under investigation, but it did not say what the exact focus of the investigation was and which federal authorities were involved.

Twitter, which sued Musk in Julyto force him to complete the $44bn dealto buy the social media company, said that lawyers for the Tesla Inc CEO had claimed “investigative privilege” in their refusal to hand over documents the company had sought as part of their legal case.

Twitter said that in late September, Musk’s attorneys had provided a “privilege log” identifying documents that would be withheld. That log referenced drafts of a May 13 email to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a slide presentation to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

The court filing, which asked Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick to order Musk’s attorneys to provide the withheld documents, was made on October 6 — the same day that McCormickpaused litigation between the two sides after Musk reversed courseand said he would proceed with the deal to buy Twitter.

McCormick has given Muskuntil October 28 to close the acquisition. If the deal does not get done by then, a trial date will be set for November.

“This game of ‘hide the ball’ must end,” Twitter said in the court filing.

Alex Spiro,a lawyer for Musk, told the Reuters news agency that Twitter’s court filing was a “misdirection” and countered: “It is Twitter’s executives that are under federal investigation.”

Twitter declined to comment on Spiro’s statement and also declined comment when asked by Reuters about its understanding of any investigation into Musk. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and the FTC declined to comment.

The SEC has questionedMusk’s comments about the Twitter acquisition, including whether a 9 percent stake that he had built up before announcing his bid had been disclosed late and why it indicated that he intended to be a passive shareholder.

Musk later refiled the disclosure to indicate he was an active investor. In June, the SEC asked Musk in a letter whether he should have amended his public filing to reflect his intention to suspend or abandon the deal.

Tech news site The Information reported in April that the FTC was scrutinising whether Musk failed to comply with antitrust reporting requirements relating to an investor’s intentions of being a passive or active shareholder.

Twitter said in June, however, that the takeover deal with Musk had cleared an antitrust waiting period for review by the FTC and US Justice Department.

On Wednesday, Musk said that he had launched a new fragrance called “Burnt Hair” to raise funds for his Twitter acquisition, and had sold $1 million worth of the perfume within days of its launch.



“Please buy my perfume, so I can buy Twitter,” he wrote on the platform where he has almost 109 million followers. He claimed to have sold 20,000 bottles of the scent.

“With a name like mine, getting into the fragrance business was inevitable — why did I even fight it for so long!?” he wrote.

Musk’s Twitter bio now describes him as a “Perfume Salesman” and a link to the product’s sales page features a ruby red bottle with the tagline, “The Essence of Repugnant Desire.”

Each bottle retails for $100 and shipping is scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2023.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/14/elon-musk-under-investigation-twitter-inc-says-in-court-filing
Elon musk,Elon Musk reinstates Donald Trump’s Twitter account,"Elon Musk has reinstated Donald Trump’s account on Twitter, nearly two years after the former United States president wasbanned from the social media platformfor inciting violence.

Trump’s account reappeared on Twitter on Saturday after Musk, the platform’s new owner, ran a poll on the social media site that showed narrow support for allowing Trump to return.

More than 15 million people voted in the poll asking whether Trump’s account should be reinstated, with a slim majority of 51.8 percent voting in favour.

“The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated,” Musk tweeted.

But Trump said earlier on Saturday that he had no interest in returning to the platform.

“I don’t see any reason for it,” the former president said via video when asked whether he planned to return to Twitter by a panel at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership meeting.

The people have spoken.

Trump said he would stick with his new platform Truth Social, the app developed by his Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) start-up, which he said had better user engagement than Twitter and was doing “phenomenally well”.

Trump, who on Tuesdaylaunched a bid to regain the White House in 2024, also praised Musk and said he had always liked him.

But the former president also said Twitter suffered from bots, fake accounts and that the problems it faced were “incredible”.

Musk first said in May he planned to reverse the ban on Trump, and the timing of any return by the former president was closely watched — and feared — by many of Twitter’s advertisers.

Musk has since sought to reassure users and advertisers that such a decision would be made with consideration by a content moderation council composed of people with “widely diverse viewpoints”, and no account reinstatements would happen before the council convened.

He also said Twitter would not reinstate any banned users until there was a “clear process for doing so”.

This week, Musk reinstated comedian Kathy Griffin, who had been banned for changing her profile name to “Elon Musk”, which violated his new rule against impersonation without indicating it was a parody account.

There has been no new information about the process for reinstatement or the moderation council.

If Trump does not return to Twitter, it could reduce concerns among major advertisers, who are alreadyrattled by Musk’s drastic reshaping of the platform.

He has halved the workforce and severely cut the company’s trust and safety team, which is responsible for preventing the spread of misinformation and harmful content.

These actions and Musk’s tweeting have pushed big companies to halt advertising on the site as they monitor how the platform handles hate speech.

Elon musk,Elon Musk tells Twitter engineers to fly-in for meeting: Report,"Elon Musk on Friday asked any remaining Twitter employees who write software code to report to the 10th floor of the office in San Francisco by early afternoon, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.

The billionaire said in a follow-up email: “If possible, I would appreciate it if you could fly to SF to be present in person,” adding he would be at the company’s headquarters until midnight and would return Saturday morning.

He said the engineers should report at 2pm Friday (22:00 GMT).

The emails came a day after hundreds of Twitter employees apparently decided toleave the beleaguered social media companyfollowing a Thursday deadline from Musk that staffers sign up for “long hours at high intensity”.

The exodus adds to therapid change and chaos that have marked Musk’s first three weeksas Twitter’s owner, during which the company’s headcount had already been more than halved by layoffs and other departures to approximately 3,700 workers.

Twitter told employees on Thursday that it would close its offices and cut badge access until Monday, according to two sources. Reuters could not immediately confirm whether the headquarters reopened.

As of midday Friday, the company had not yet cut off access to company systems for employees who had declined to accept Musk’s offer, two other sources told Reuters.

One of those sources also said the company was planning to shut down one of Twitter’s three main US data centres, at the SMF1 facility near Sacramento, for cost-saving reasons.

Amid the changes, ratings agency Moody’s withdrew its B1 credit rating for Twitter, saying it had “insufficient or otherwise inadequate information to support the maintenance of the rating”.

A White House official also weighed in, saying Twitter should tell Americans how the company was protecting their data, a CNN reportertweeted.

In his emails on Friday, Musk ordered employees to email him a summary of what their software code has “achieved” in the past six months, “along with up to 10 screenshots of the most salient lines of code”.

“There will be short, technical interviews that allow me to better understand the Twitter tech stack,” Musk wrote in one of the emails.

Musk said earlier this week thatsome Tesla engineers were assistingin evaluating Twitter’s engineering teams, but he said it was on a “voluntary basis” and “after hours”.

He said he would try to speak with remote employees by video, and that only people who could not physically get to the company’s headquarters or have a family emergency would be excused.

In his first email to Twitter employees this month, Musk said: “We are also changing Twitter policy such that remote work is no longer allowed unless you have a specific exception.”

“Managers will send the exceptions lists to me for review and approval.”

Musk wrote on Twitter late on Thursday that he was not worried about resignations as “the best people are staying”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/11/18/elon-musk-tells-twitter-engineers-to-fly-in-for-meeting-report
Elon musk,Elon Musk meets Netanyahu during Israel visit,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, touring a kibbutz targeted by Palestinian gunmen during an October 7 attack and expressing support for Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The visit comes amid a period of controversy for Musk, who recentlysparked outrageby calling an anti-Semitic social media post – one promoting the conspiracy theory that white people in the West are being “replaced” through immigration from the Global South with the help of progressive Jews – “the actual truth”.

After touring the decimated kibbutz ofKfar Azawith Netanyahu, Musk said in a conversation with the prime minister on X Spaces that it was “jarring to see the scene of the massacre” and that Israel has “no choice” but to eliminate Hamas.

The trip comes on the fourth day of an ongoing truce between Israel and Hamas, during which Israel is recovering dozens of captives in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.

Musk is also scheduled to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, whose office said in a statement that the meeting would underscore “the need to act to combat rising antisemitism online”.

Under Musk’s tenure, critics have said that the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has seen a proliferation of hate speech and anti-Semitism content, and several companies suspended advertising on the platform after a report accused X of running their ads alongside content from neo-Nazis and white nationalists.

X Corp is currently suing non-profit Media Matters on the grounds that it has driven away advertisers by portraying the site as rife with anti-Semitic content.

Musk has also threatened to file suit against the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish advocacy group, over its claims that problematic and racist speech has soared on the site since he completed his $44bn takeover.

As Musk arrived, Israel announced it had struck an agreement “in principle” to use SpaceX’s Starlink communications channel in Gaza, where Musk had previously suggested it could be utilised to enhance communications.

The agreement marked a major shift for Israel, whose communication minister previously dismissed the idea of opening up Starlink to Gaza because it said Hamas would use it for “terrorist activities”.

But on Monday, Israeli Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi announced Israel had reached an agreement in principle under which “Starlink satellite units can only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications, including the Gaza Strip”.

In an X post addressed to Musk, Karhi said he hoped the entrepreneur’s visit to Israel “will serve as a springboard for future endeavors, as well as enhance your relationship with the Jewish people and values we share with the entire world”.

Elon Musk, I congratulate you for reaching a principle understanding with the Ministry of Communications under my leadership.

X has been a key source of information and debate about the Gaza war, with government officials, as well as pro-Israel and pro-Palestine users, sharing content. However, critics say it has also amplified misinformation, conspiracy theories, and hateful content, including anti-Semitism, during the conflict.

Following the outbreak of the Gaza war on October 7, anti-Semitism incidents in the United States rose by nearly 400 percent from the year-earlier period, according to the ADL.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations reported a 216 percent increase in Islamophobic and anti-Arab incidents between October 7 and November 4.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/elon-musk-arrives-in-israel-flight-tracker
Elon musk,Elon Musk is the X-factor in the new Trump administration,"Billionaire Elon Musk dedicated significant personal time and at least$260mto Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.

That massive investment paid off for Trump, who has now returned to the White House. And it’s paid off for Musk, who has bought himself a choice seat at the new president’s table – he literally dined with the Trump family on Thanksgiving.









Musk has also been given a potentially powerful role as head of the “Department of Government Efficiency”, a nebulous nongovernmental entity charged with auditing the entire federal government. And as Trump begins to reassert his foreign policy in his early days back in office, Musk has made himself a key presence in Trump’s ad hoc diplomacy.

Musk joined Trump on acallto Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and at the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Musk’s growing role as an adviser, and perhaps more, on issues of foreign policy presents one of the biggest wild cards for the new Trump administration. If Musk remains as influential in the Trump administration as he has been during the campaign and transition periods, we are poised to see an American foreign policy driven by Musk’s net worth, his worldview, and, most notably, his ego.

Musk’s nine-figure investment in getting Trump elected has already benefitted Musk financially. Tesla’s market cap topped$1 trillionand Musk’s personal fortune grew to more than $300bn immediately after Trump’s win. Investors are counting on Musk’s companies benefitting from access to Trump, and they have good reason to believe that even American foreign policy will bend to serve these corporate interests.

Musk has managed to funnel American taxpayer dollars into his business ventures for years by painting his bottom line as a public good. Early in the Obama administration, the federal government extended a$465m loanto Tesla as part of its economic stimulus and clean energy agendas, helping the company move from a niche player to a major force in the auto industry. In 2015, the Los Angeles Times documented nearly$5bnin government subsidies acquired by Musk’s companies, including Telsa and SpaceX, and that number has only grown over time. For instance, although Musk had initially donated the use of his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine during its war against Russia, the Pentagon quietlypicked up the tabfor an undisclosed amount after Musk threatened to cut the service off.

But even these examples pale in comparison to the extent to which American foreign policy may be dictated by Musk’s corporate interests going forward. Amid European efforts to regulate Musk’s social media platform X and punish Musk for noncompliance, incoming Vice President JD Vancesuggestedthat continuing American support for NATO be conditioned on Europe rolling back its efforts against X.

Musk haslobbiedthe Trump administration tokill a tax crediton electric vehicles, a move that would deal a blow to US car manufacturers like General Motors and Ford – helping Musk’s own Tesla by hurting these competitors – and benefit China, which already has a huge lead on the EV market, including much of Tesla’s production.

Musk’s influence on foreign policy may have an outsized impact on areas of the world where Trump is simply uninterested. Take sub-Saharan Africa, a region that Trump mostly ignored outside of dismissing countries there as “s***holes” and targeting several of them with his so-called “Muslim ban”. Musk’s Starlink service is rapidlyexpanding across Africa. This has boosted internet access in a number of countries, but continued expansion faces regulatory hurdles. This is a policy area in which Musk could use the levers of American influence to pressure these governments to drop their attempts to restrict or regulate Starlink. Such a move would have both benefits and costs for the countries involved, expanding connectivity for their citizens but potentially costing telecom jobs if local providers are pushed out of business. But the benefits to Musk are clear, and Musk is well-positioned to use his leverage here and elsewhere to the benefit of his corporate empire.

Outside of promoting positions and policies that would increase his already massive net worth, Musk has also established an increasingly conservative political agenda which sometimes supersedes his financial interests. Musk’s impulsive purchase of Twitter seems to have been driven by his absolutist position on “free speech” and his desire to own a platform where he can freely share his own opinions about the world. As Musk has drifted to the far right in his own views, which he regularly shares on X, he has found a kindred spirit in Donald Trump. In recent months, Musk has tweeted in favour of cuttingforeign aidand expressed scepticism atinternational treatiesthat “restrict the freedoms of Americans,” ideas that resonate with Trump.

Trump and Musk indeed share a penchant for cosying up to authoritarians and the far right. After sparking controversy on Inauguration Day by giving what appeared to be aNazi salute– an accusation that Musk has subsequently mocked online – the billionaire appeared by video at an event held by Germany’s far-right AfD party. Musk has previouslyinsistedthat “only AfD can save Germany.” Musk has similarly backedfar-rightopposition parties in countries such as the UK. In the past, Musk made statements appearing toappeaseRussian control over Crimea – apparently after Musk had communicated with Putin over the issue – and Chinese ambitions to take control of Taiwan. Musk is also developing arelationshipwith Argentina’s right-wing President Javier Milei, who hasslashed the country’s budgetin a move to fight out-of-control inflation, but at the cost of plummeting GDP and rising poverty. Musk sees Milei’s policies as a model to be duplicated in the US. When it comes to alienating longstanding American allies and placating autocrats and ideologues, Musk is set to reinforce Trump’s own tendencies.

But figuring out the ideological direction that Musk will turn American foreign policy is perhaps not the most relevant frame for viewing his involvement with the incoming administration. From Musk’s point of view, his concerns about the directions that the world will take on important issues like war and peace seem rooted less in principle and more in the idea that he should be the one guiding these outcomes. Musk is an egoist; he wants to be the one implementing the grand visions for the world, even if his mercurial nature means that the content of those visions changes frequently.

Look at his involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war. Shortly after the Russian invasion in 2022, Musk challenged Vladimir Putin to afistfightto resolve the issue. When that solution did not work, Musk volunteered the use of his Starlink services to Ukraine, giving the country’s military a much-needed logistical lifeline. But Musk’s donation of his Starlink satellite internet services to Ukraine has not simply been an act of generosity or solidarity with Ukraine. Rather, it’s part of a larger effort by Musk to manage the conflict. This can be seen by Musk’s decisions tolimitwhat Starlink can be used for – over the objections of the Ukrainian government and its military strategists. Furthermore, Musk has reportedly had initially undisclosedconversationswith Vladimir Putin, and the businessman offered an unsolicited “peace plan” that was quickly rejected by Zelenskyy as appeasement to Russia.

In short, Musk unilaterally decided to insert himself as a major player in the Russia-Ukraine war. Having attempted to micromanage the conflict as a private citizen, Musk’s growing role as a quasi-government agent for Trump will only magnify his sense of self-importance in global affairs.

As a businessman, Musk has taken the approach of casting a wide net, invested in everything from electric vehicles to space travel to social media in order to create a many-headed corporate hydra. As he enters politics, his ill-defined Department of Government Efficiency has seen itself as having the entire federal government as its jurisdiction. Musk is likely to take a similarly all-encompassing view of foreign policy, stepping into any and every situation in which he sees himself as smarter than the experts.

And Trump, who values loyalty and wealth above credentials when selecting his top aides, seems to be encouraging this type of overreach.

Muskmetwith Iran’s ambassador to the UN in a conversation towards resetting relations between the two countries. This task is a tall order after Trump authorised the killing of a top Iranian general during his first presidency and Iran allegedly authorised an assassination plot against Trump in retaliation. Most administrations, seeking to negotiate such a significant reboot of bilateral relations with a major geopolitical foe in the middle of a precarious time for the Middle East, would assign the task to top-level professional diplomats rather than a mercurial billionaire.

But Donald Trump is not most presidents and Elon Musk is not most billionaires. The semi-isolationist “Make America Great Again” Trump is only somewhat interested in the rest of the world, and Musk has grand designs to rework the world, andother worldsas well, according to his own whims. Whether it’s Middle East diplomacy, European conflict or African infrastructure, look for Elon Musk to assert that he knows best, with the weight of the US government now behind him.

Elon musk,"Elon Musk’s DOGE seeks access to US taxpayers’ data, sparking privacy fears","Elon Musk’s task force for streamlining the United States government is seeking access to troves of taxpayer information, media outlets have reported, prompting fears of privacy violations and retribution against political rivals.

In the latest phase of his sweeping cost-cutting drive, Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are pushing to access the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) protected Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS), outlets including The Associated Press, CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post reported on Monday.

The IDRS gives IRS employees access to sensitive taxpayer data belonging to millions of Americans, such as Social Security numbers, home addresses, property records and salary information.

DOGE had yet to gain access to the system as of Sunday evening, multiple media outlets reported.

White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said direct access to the IRS database was necessary to root out “deeply entrenched” waste, fraud and abuse.

“DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on,” Fields said.







The move has alarmed Democratic lawmakers and other critics of US President Donald Trump’s administration amid concerns that Musk, the world’s richest person, istaking controlof large areas of the federal government with little oversight.

In a letter to the IRS on Monday, Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren expressed concern that Musk was seeking to weaponise the tax system to target US citizens and businesses as part of a political agenda.

“The IRS must immediately disclose to the Senate Committee on Finance the full extent of the potential access to IRS systems and data granted to DOGE team members so that the Committee can address any efforts by DOGE personnel to gain access to taxpayer records at the IRS, which may constitute criminal violations of federal privacy laws,” Wyden and Warren wrote.

On Monday, Musk appeared to signal his intention to use taxpayer data to target Trump’s political opponents in a post on his social media platform X.

After an X user said in a post responding to Democratic Senator Adam Schiff that Musk wanted to “snoop around” the finances of the California lawmaker, not members of the general public, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO shared the post with an emoji of an index finger pointing downward.

Meanwhile, a new X account called DOGE IRS asked members of the public to share “insights on finding and fixing waste, fraud and abuse” at the IRS.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/18/elon-musks-doge-seeks-access-to-us-taxpayers-data-sparking-privacy-fears
Elon musk,Zelenskyy adviser claims Elon Musk allowed Russians to hit Ukrainian cities,"Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has slammed Elon Musk for indirectly allowing Russian forces to attack Ukrainian cities after it was revealed his Starlink satellite communications interfered with a drone operation.

Details of the incident are laid out in a biography of Musk by Walter Isaacson, due out on Tuesday. The book describes how the network turned off communications near the coast of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula as Ukrainian drones were approaching Russian warships, resulting in “lost connectivity”.

Musk allegedly ordered Starlink engineers to turn off the communications as he feared Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond with nuclear weapons to a Ukrainian attack on Crimea, according to Isaacson’s book.

“I think if the Ukrainian attacks had succeeded in sinking the Russian fleet, it would have been like a mini Pearl Harbor and led to a major escalation,” Musk isquoted as saying. “We did not want to be a part of that.”

Podolyak chose X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk owns, to launch a scathing attack on the tech billionaire.

In his post, he said by “not allowing” Ukrainian drones to attack Russian warships, Musk “allowed this fleet to fire Kalibr missiles at Ukrainian cities” – an action he said resulted in the death of civilians and children.

Responding to the excerpt in the book, Musk on Friday said he refused the request saying he feared complicity in a “major” act of war.

In the post on X, Musk said he had no choice but to reject an emergency request from Ukraine “to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol”.

“The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor,” Musk wrote. “If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.”

Podolyak has criticised Musk before. In February, he wrote, “A year of Ukrainian resistance & companies have to decide: Either they are on the side of Ukraine & the right to freedom, and don’t seek ways to do harm. Or they are on Russia’s side & its ‘right’ to kill & seize territories.”

SpaceX’s Starlink service, which boasts a fast-growing network of more than 4,000 satellites in low Earth orbit, has been used by Ukrainian troops for various efforts, including battlefield communications.

SpaceX, through private donations and under a separate contract with a United States foreign aid agency, has provided Ukrainians and the country’s military with Starlink since the beginning of the war in 2022.

Musk has been accused in the past of posting Russian narratives, which include suggesting parts of occupied Ukraine be handed over to Russia.

The European Commission alsopublished a reportthat shows X, formerly known as Twitter, has played a significant role in spreading Russian propaganda.

In Isaacson’s book, Musk complained about Starlink’s involvement in the conflict. “Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars.

Elon musk,Musk’s $101bn Tesla pay package again rejected by US judge,"A judge in the United States has upheld a decision to deny Tesla CEO Elon Musk a multibillion-dollar pay package despite shareholders voting to restore the compensation deal.

The decision by a Delaware judge on Monday reaffirmed an earlier ruling to void the pay deal on the basis that Tesla’s board was too close to Musk and had not sufficiently protected shareholders’ interests.

Chancellor Kathaleen St Jude McCormick of Delaware’s Court of Chancery found that there was no legal precedent to reverse her earlier ruling and that if courts condoned “the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable”.

“The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,” McCormick wrote in a 103-page opinion.

McCormick also found that Tesla had made “material misstatements” to shareholders about the effect of their vote to reinstate Musk’s pay deal.

Tesla shares dropped 1.4 percent in after-hours trading following the ruling.

McCormick also rejected a request for $5bn in fees sought by the lawyers of plaintiff Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder who brought the original lawsuit accusing Tesla’s board of not acting independently of Musk, instead granting the amount of $345m.

After McCormick’s decision to block the deal earlier this year, Tesla shareholders in June overwhelmingly voted to reinstate the package.

Tesla on Monday said the court’s decision was “wrong” and that it would appeal the decision.

“This ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs’ lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners – the shareholders,”’ the electric car company said on X.

Musk on X said that “shareholders should control company votes, not judges,” and described McCormick as an “activist posing as a judge”.

Under the terms of his 2018 pay deal, Musk agreed to be paid in Tesla stock options each time the company reached certain goals instead of receiving a salary.

Musk hit all of the targets, which focused on metrics including market capitalisation, earnings and sales, helping make him the world’s richest man.

Elon musk,Elon Musk says Twitter hiding key witnesses in bot battle: Report,"Elon Musk is accusing Twitter Inc. of hiding key witnesses in their legal battle over whether he must consummate a $44 billion buyout of the company, according to people familiar with the allegations.

Musk contends the social media company isn’t producing the names of employees specifically responsible for evaluating how much of Twitter’s customer base is made up of spam and robot accounts, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

Musk’s lawyers have asked the judge in the case to force Twitter to identify the workers so the defense can get their records and question them, the people said.

A letter asking Delaware Chancery Court JudgeKathaleen St. J. McCormickto compel Twitter to hand over the names was filed Tuesday under seal. Under the court’s rules, Twitter’s attorneys have five business days to decide what should be redacted from the filing as proprietary information.

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on the filing.

The letter comes as the Tesla Inc. co-founder said Tuesday he is selling$6.9 billionof Tesla shares to avoid a sudden sale in the event he is forced to go ahead with the deal to acquire Twitter. That has prompted some analysts to predict the billionaire may settle the case.

So far Twitter has handed over the names of “records custodians,” who aren’t as familiar with the data at issue, the people said. Musk wants McCormick to force Twitter to come up with the names of the employees charged with monitoring those accounts, they said.

Both sides have issued a torrent of subpoenas to banks, investors and lawyers involved in the teetering transaction as they seek ammunition for an Oct. 17 trial.

“It’s another salvo in the discovery wars that are common in this kind of litigation,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who specializes in securities and merger and acquisition law. “Both sides are jockeying for position by targeting different information.”

Twitter’s lawyers say they’ll need only four days in court to prove Musk is using questions about spam and bot accounts as a pretext to walk away from the deal. The company said it has turned over all its information about those accounts and that it intends to make Musk pay the $54.20 per share he originally agreed to.

Musk counters in court filings that Twitter’s handover of the that material hasn’t been robust and that the company has failed to produce evidence that spam bots account for fewer than 5% of its active users, as it has said in regulatory filings. He argues this gives him a legitimate basis for canceling the buyout.

He alleges Twitter’s disclosures show that the actual number of monetizable daily active users, or mDAU as the industry calls it, is 65 million less than the 238 million Twitter has claimed. He says Twitter also misrepresents how many of those users view advertising, the company’s main source of revenue. By his estimate, fewer than 16 million users see the majority of ads and should be counted as monetizable.

Elon musk,Can Elon Musk’s Starlink provide internet service to Gaza?,"As Gaza experienced anear-total communications blackout on Friday, a campaign began trending on social media platforms, calling on billionaire tycoon Elon Musk to power the bombarded enclave with Starlink internet.

The satellite internet venture operated by SpaceX is comprised of a “constellation of thousands of satellites” that orbit very close to Earth at about 550km (340 miles) from the surface, making it easier to provide internet services in rural and isolated regions of the world where the internet terminals and cables aren’t strong.

SpaceX CEO Muskinitially respondedto a post calling for Starlink support for Gaza, saying that it wasn’t clear who had authority for ground links in the besieged enclave and that “no terminals from Gaza have attempted to communicate with our constellation”.

After the calls for Musk to support communication in Gaza through Starlink gained momentum, the billionare businessman announced that “Starlink will support connectivity to internationally recognized aid organizations in Gaza.”

While Starlink’s tagline is the promise of “connectivity where you least expect it”, Marc Owen Jones, associate professor of Middle East Studies at Hamad Bin Khalifa University based in Doha, is uncertain if it can work in Gaza.

“We’ve seen 500,000 posts on X saying Starlink should power Gaza. But people don’t actually appreciate that ‘Starlink for Gaza’ is an impossibility,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Starlink terminals or dishes in Gaza would be difficult to smuggle in and distribute at scale. The Israeli government is unlikely to allow legal imports of it,” Owen Jones told Al Jazeera.

“But let’s say Starlink got in. How will it be powered? There is no fuel in Gaza right now.”

The Gaza Strip has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007. Israel controls Gaza’s airspace and territorial waters, and regulates all the goods and services that enter and leave through two of Gaza’s three border crossing points. The third crossing is controlled by Egypt.

Owen Jones also noted that the Starlink network relies on ground stations that would need approval within Gaza, which he says is unlikely to get under the current situation.

“Owning a Starlink terminal with two-way transmission could endanger Gazans if detected by Israeli authorities,” he said, adding that the internet provision would likely meet opposition from the United States and Israel administrations.

On Saturday, Israel’s Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi lashed out at Musk on the social media platform X for considering provision of Starlink to aid organisations in Gaza. Karhi said Israel will cut off any ties with Starlink.

“HAMAS will use it for terrorist activities. There is no doubt about it, we know it, and Musk knows it,” Karhi said.

Musk responded by saying that his company is “not so naive” and would do “a security check with both the US and Israeli governments before turning on even a single terminal”.

This isn’t the first time Musk has been asked to provide Starlink internet services in warzones.

In February 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine, Musk instantly ensured Starlink terminals would be made available to help people and the army in Ukraine after internet services were disrupted due to the war.

But a year into the conflict, concerns over Starlink aiding Russia’s military have been raised.

In September, Musk faced criticism from leaders in Ukraine for refusing to have Starlink services in Russian-annexed Crimea.

On the social media platform X, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak alsoclaimedthat Starlink allowed Russian drones to hit Ukrainian cities.

“Sometimes a mistake is much more than just a mistake. By not allowing Ukrainian drones to destroy part of the Russian military (!) fleet via Starlink interference, Elon Musk allowed this fleet to fire Kalibr missiles at Ukrainian cities,” Podolyak said on X.

Musk replied by saying he had no choice but to reject an emergency request from Ukraine “to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol” – a response that has beenpraisedby Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Meanwhile, despite issues over its use in Crimea, Starlink is still in use on all other fronts in Ukraine.

After a communications blackout that lasted for almost 36 hours, the Paltel Group, which provides communications services in Gaza, said that telecommunication services are “gradually being restored” in the Gaza Strip.

But with Musk’s Starlink proposal for Gaza only seeking to cater to international aid organisations, efforts continue across the globe to ensure that ordinary civilians in Gaza are able to continue communicating with each other in case telecommunication services are disrupted again.

Egypt-based journalist and writer Mirna El Helbawi began a social media campaign of collecting eSIMS from around the world to help people in Gaza.

An eSim card allows users to activate a mobile network’s cellular plans without using a physical SIM card.

“Until we fix the Starlink issue with Egyptian and Palestinian red crescent; If anyone in Gaza, needs an European E-sim to activate their internet connection, let me know,” Helbawi said.

Until we fix the starlink issue with Egyptian and Palestinian red crescent; If anyone in Gaza, needs an European E-sim to activate their internet connection, let me know. I have my european followers on instagram who are willing to help.pic.twitter.com/VUn9nryhNf

— Mirna El Helbawi (@Mirna_elhelbawi)October 28, 2023



Since then, El Helbawi expressed on X that she has managed to send free eSIMS to several journalists, people, and a few doctors in Gaza.

She added that she has now teamed up with telecommunications startup Simly to ensure “everyone gets stable and consistent internet access there [in Gaza]”.

Some social media users who have sent eSIMS to help people in Gaza suggested using applications likeNomadto purchase eSim cards.

After choosing the “Middle East” mobile data plan on the app and paying for the service provider of choice, people receive a QR code.

This code can then be sent to civilians in need in Gaza through organisations or people on the ground who are helping to distribute eSIMS.

I sent mine to@BasharChaheenbtwhttps://t.co/RlXlpUnlWq

— Hashashin (@HashashinTag)October 28, 2023



In addition to efforts with eSIMS and SIM cards, the Qatari telecommunications company Ooredoo Group has also been helping people in the Gaza Strip communicate since 2017 with the launch of Wataniya Mobile.

Since the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, Egypt’s role in Gaza has gained importance.

Cairo controls the Rafah border crossing, which has proved as a lifeline for the people in Gaza since last week, when aid trucks were allowed to enter the territory through the crossing. More than 8,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israeli bombings while a total siege means there’s not enough food, fuel or water to meet basic needs.

Some on social media have also questioned whether Musk’s Starlink could set up terminals at the Rafah crossing so that internet services in Gaza could be supported.

But Owen Jones told Al Jazeera that even if they [Egypt] allowed it or were allowed to set up Starlink terminals, “it would have limited efficacy”.

Meanwhile, according to local media reports in Egypt, Vodafone Egypt has announced that mobile communication stations have been prepared to be sent to the border between Egypt and Gaza in order to boost internet and mobile phone networks in Gaza.

While international aid organisations have welcomed Musk’s proposal to help them with Starlink, questions remain over how it will be installed in an enclave that continues to be bombarded relentlessly and remains under a blockade.

“We could really benefit from Starlink to try getting in touch with our staff and health facilities in Gaza. How can we make it happen?” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom GhebreyesusaskedMusk on X.

SpaceX and Musk haven’t yet responded to how installations for aid organisations will begin working.

According to Owen Jones, Musk is wading into uncharted territory.

“I don’t think he gets the dominance of Israel’s control over the area, the dangers Starlink might put Gazans in,” Owen Jones said. “He is doing this to simply look good in light of the campaign for Starlink to be given to Gazans.”

Elon musk,Elon Musk believes he got Trump elected. Now he’s coming for Europe,"Depending on who you talk to in Europe,Elon Muskis either a courageous champion of free speech hero or a petulant and dangerous troublemaker.

“He’s using his superpowers to say, ‘I’m going to give a voice to the voiceless.’ He’s a once-in-a-multigeneration human being. He’s my hero. He’s amazing,” said author Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a critic of Islam and former Dutch politician, on the podcast, Honestly.

According to Ian Hislop, editor of the British satirical newspaper Private Eye, Musk is “a classic social media adolescent who hasn’t grown up – the temper tantrums, the lack of responsibility.”

He recently told LBC radio in the United Kingdom that Musk is “riddled with contradictions, and at some point, I am hoping that even his followers will begin to notice that from sentence to sentence, he makes no sense.”

Musk, the tech billionaire who owns X and backed United States President Donald Trump, is at the centre of several debates in Europe having fanned British politics into a firestorm by amplifying attacks on Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer and platforming Germany’s far right.

At one point on X Muskasserted, “Starmer is evil.”







He threw his narrative-shaping powers behind an opposition Conservative campaign in the UK to reopen an inquiry into what it called a sexual abuse coverup by police and prosecutors.

The abusers in question, dubbed grooming gangs, were British men of Pakistani heritage who sexually assaulted white underage girls in towns across the Midlands in the late 1990s and 2000s.

After a Times investigation in 2013 into the scandal – that these organised criminal rings had operated for years without major police intervention, an inquiry followed.

Starmer refused to reopen the inquiry on the grounds that the Conservative and populistReformparties sought only to feed a far-right, anti-immigrant hysteria, but Musk continued to assail him for “harbouring known terrorists”.

Musk falsely claimed that posting a meme critical of Starmer “could get you sent to prison in Britain”, and amplified claims by the right-wing news outlet GB News asserting, “UK politicians are selling your daughters for votes.”

Musk is also busy meddling in German politics, in advance of acritical election next monththat the governing Social Democrats are set to lose.

“My recommendation to the people of Germany is that you must vote for change. Voting for [the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland, or AfD] is simply the sensible and common sense move … Nothing outrageous is being proposed. Just common sense… only AfD can save Germany,” Musk asserted on X.

On January 9, he conducted an interview with AfD leader Alice Weidel, in which she recast Adolph Hitler’s Nazis as the forerunners not of her party, which sprang from the Neonazi movement, but of Germany’s Social Democrats.

“The biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Hitler as right and conservative. He was exactly the opposite,” Weidel told Musk. “He was a communist, socialist guy … We are exactly the opposite. We are a libertarian conservative party. We are wrongly framed the entire time, and we would like to free the people.”

Within a week, the interview had been viewed 16 million times and sparked the envy of the leader of Germany’s Free Democrats.

“The most pathetic figure I have seen is Christian Lindner, writing to Musk saying, ‘Don’t support the AfD, support me because I am the true libertarian here in Germany,’” said Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, who heads the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.

“European leaders are totally lost in the short-term issues. Who will vote for Christian Lindner after he has asked Musk to interfere in the German election?”

Weidel says she will release the energies of the German people to innovate and pursue enterprise, which in her view, is hampered by bureaucracy, over-regulation, over-taxation and immigration – positions identical to those of US President-elect Donald Trump, whom Musk also promoted on X.







Musk’s power through his social media site to shape what many people perceive to be the truth is causing deep concern on both sides of the Atlantic.

In a farewell speech to the American people on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said, “Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy … I’m equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex … Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation that enables the abuse of power.”

There are similar concerns in Europe that the inordinate sum Musk paid for Twitter – $44bn – which he renamed X, only made sense if it was to be recouped through influence.

“Musk is convinced … that the decision … to buy Twitter is a turning point in American history, and by doing that Musk saved American democracy,” said Torreblanca. “Otherwise, Democrats would have been in power forever,” he told Al Jazeera.

“He thinks it is now the time to promote this agenda globally, to fight progressives wherever they are.”

Digital experts place X’s penetration somewhere between 50 and 100 million users on the continent of 550 million people, but Musk’s reach is amplified through the news media and his influence on other platform owners.

Musk’s close alliance with Trump also creates the perception that he speaks for the president, and gives him power over his peers.

On January 7, Facebook and Instagram CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a video saying, “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritising speech … we’re going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes, similar to X.”

This, says Torreblanca, means “something will be taken down only if another reader asks them to do so, which is basically to delegate to users the integrity and quality of the platform which is unacceptable to European legislation.”

Europe’s Digital Services Act makes it mandatory for platforms to moderate content because they are liable for content that is harmful or violent or offensive to different groups.

The overwhelming support the DSA has from a broad political spectrum – conservatives, socialists and Greens – means the EU can enforce it in a neutral and even-handed manner, said Torreblanca, avoiding the dramatic confrontation and ban imposed by Brazil last year.

“In practice, our competition authorities in the EU are autonomous to make investigations and fine [a] company,” said Torreblanca, “and I think the best way Europe should do this is in a politically impassionate way.”

The European Commission may be Europe’s only authority capable of standing up to Musk. The UK and Germany did not individually threaten X with a suspension or legal action. But even the Commission may be intimidated, said Giorgos Verdi, who works with the ECFR in Brussels.

“[Musk’s] new connections with Trump make it very difficult to respond,” Verdi told Al Jazeera. “Trump views the US tech champions as very important instruments when it comes to the trade war with China. If the EU forces those companies to slow down by following regulations, this could become a national security issue for the US.”

Musk may even be educating those focused on pushing Kremlin narratives, believed Maxim Alyukov, a research fellow at Manchester University’s Department of Russian and Eastern European Studies.

“Russian influence operations are actually modelled on examples of Trump or Musk,” said Alyukov.







“They select certain incidents, like scandals in the UK … and then they try to present certain politicians as the solution to this problem. That is exactly what Musk does,” he told Al Jazeera.

Musk promoted the UK’s Reform Party as the solution to what he and the hard right often term “uncontrolled” immigration and gang rape.

Musk and Moscow both realised they needed dedicated ecosystems to normalise and disseminate their views, said Alyukov, who recently co-wrote a study of outlets Moscow funded in Europe, which pose as legitimate news services but release Russian messaging at key moments, such as elections.

“You don’t do outright censorship. You create a conducive ecosystem to making your voice heard, and what [Musk] did was he basically got himself an ecosystem,” Alyukov said.

Musk has fused his companies’ interests with the state’s, making himself indispensable.

Space-X launches NASA’s payloads, Starlink provides the Pentagon with the largest global system of communications satellites, and Tesla disrupted a global car industry that had marginalised Detroit carmakers, bringing the US back to the fore.

X has now become the dominant global communications platform, and Musk is weaponising it against news media, telling followers, “X is the future, it’s citizen journalism … It’s by the people, for the people.”

That has set much of the newsgathering agenda, with newspapers scrambling to investigate whether a rumour on X is a story or a canard.

“I think he thought … ‘I can say anything I like, it doesn’t have to be true, it’s better if it’s not true, and no one will stop me,” said Hislop. “We’re in an era of total fatuity.”

“The economy has been geopoliticised,” said Verdi. “It’s not just about applying ethical principles to technology equally. It’s also about power.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/21/elon-musk-believes-he-got-trump-elected-now-hes-coming-for-europe
Elon musk,What Musk and Trump describe is not the South Africa I know and love,"As a white South African man now living in the United States, I am acutely aware of the oversized role played by Elon Musk and a few other white men with strong South African ties in the US’slurch towards authoritarianism. These include far-right tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who spent formative years of his childhood in apartheid South Africa; US President Donald Trump’s Cape Town-born “AI and crypto tsar” David Sacks; and Joel Pollak, the South African-American conservative political commentator currently serving as the senior editor-at-large of the Breitbart News Network.

While I am no billionaire and have no influence over government policy, these men and I still have quite a bit in common. I was born in apartheid South Africa about the same time as Musk, Pollak and Sacks and benefitted from the system. Like them,I eventually migrated to the US. Like Musk, I went to Veldskool, or “field school” – a weeklong camp during high school during which teachers tried to indoctrinate us into Christian nationalism, the whites-only political ideology of the apartheid government. Also like him, I was a nerdy boy who was relentlessly bullied in school.









However, I am also very different from these men – and not just because I do not have billions in the bank or a direct line to the US president. UnlikeMusk, I do not support racist pseudoscience.Unlike Musk and the administration these men serve, I question the apartheid-era policies that allowed a small minority – white South Africans – to control a disproportionate amount of land and resources. And most importantly, I take pride in the achievements and progress of post-apartheid South Africa.

In the early 1990s when South Africa was making a transition from apartheid to democracy, I was working as a radio journalist at the country’s national broadcaster. I remember the pride and elation felt across the country as South Africans of all races and backgrounds lined up to vote on April 27, 1994, in their first democratic elections. Over the next few years, my colleagues and I were part of the effort to transform the South African Broadcasting Corporation from a government mouthpiece to a genuine public broadcaster.

As South Africans won the fight for democracy, they faced another battle, this time against the AIDS pandemic. Once again, the country, and its people rose up to the challenge. Millions of South Africans organised and took to the streets to demand and ultimately achieve access to antiretroviral medications. After relentless pressure, the government agreed to commit to treatment. The US government also did the right thing and agreed to generously fund AIDS drug treatment in the country through the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). South Africa has beenone of the biggest recipients of PEPFAR aid, receiving $332.6m in 2024. This aid saved countless South African lives.

Now, no doubt with full support from his billionaire friends nostalgic for the miserable days of apartheid, Trump has cut this funding. The cuts for AIDS treatment came with Trump’s recent executive orders halting US aid to South Africa and offering support and refuge to white South Africans he described as “victims of unjust racial discrimination”. Later, the Trump administration also decided to expel the South African ambassador to the US,Ebrahim Rasool.

Trump is following Musk’s lead in branding post-apartheid South Africa a country riddled with racial discrimination. Musk has previously described his birth nation as having “racist ownership laws” and accused its government of failing to stop what he calls a “genocide” against white farmers.

What Musk and Trump describe is not anything like the country I know and love.

My South African husband and I moved to the US in 2010 because I was offered a chance to play a part in supporting public health activists internationally through a job at the Open Society Foundations in New York.

We decided this was too exciting an opportunity to turn down – but moving to the US from South Africa was not an easy decision. We had a very comfortable life, and moving to the US actually meant losing a number of rights and protections we had in South Africa, such as good labour protections, paid family leave and – as a gay couple – the right to marry. (Same-sex marriage would not become legal nationwide in the US for another five years.) South Africans of all races also enjoy the right to abortion and the constitutional rights to health, education and housing – even if these are still far from being a reality in practice.

I became a US citizen in December 2023. It was a bittersweet time. My father, Malcolm, had died a few days before – and I had to postpone heading home for the memorial until I was able to obtain my new US passport. He was a man of faith – a minister in the Congregational Church – who donated his body to science. A devout Christian who was loving and supportive when I came out as gay and even when I told him I was leaving the church, he deeply admired the anti-Nazi German dissident Dietrich Bonhoeffer and urged my siblings and me to always have the courage of our convictions.

Unlike Musk, Thiel, Sacks and Pollak, I have no nostalgia for apartheid, and if I am to have the courage of my convictions as my father taught me, I feel I must speak out when Musk cynically labelsefforts to undo the legacy of segregation “racism” and leads the way in cutting the funding for international health and development assistance (a tiny fraction of the US federal budget) that, according to experts, could result inmore than 500,000 deathsin South Africa over the next decade.

I feel compelled to speak out because Musk and his uberwealthy South African-born or -raised friends – people with more money than many of us can fathom – are now directly working with the American president to take everything away from those who have almost nothing.

Their model is not the one we should be following. There are far better examples in the past and present. TakeJennifer Davis, who helped forge constructive connections between South Africa and the US based on human rights and justice. Or the many members of theCHANGE coalition, led by organisations such asHealth GAPin the US and theHealth Justice Initiativein South Africa, who are right now collaborating to challenge and reverse Trump’s aid cuts. Or the millions of people in both countries who are showing up every day to do the work necessary to make the US and South Africa better for all their people, no matter their race, sexuality or bank balance, motivated and inspired by the values of democracy, social justice and Ubuntu – the idea that we are all connected and responsible for one another.

Musk and his like-minded friends may now have all the power, but they are just a tiny minority. Justice- and democracy-loving people of South Africa and the US won against their kind before, and I am certain they will do so again.

Elon musk,Elon Musk says he will move companies out of California over trans law,"Elon Musk has said he will move SpaceX and X out of California over a law that bans schools from forcing teachers to notify parents when their child changes their gender identity.

Musk said on Tuesday that he would relocate the companies’ headquarters to Texas after California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first-of-its-kind law barring policies that require educators to disclose when a student asks to use a different name or pronouns.

“This is the final straw,” Musk said on X. “Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas.”

Musk, who has an adult transgender daughter, added that he had previously told Newsom “that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children”.

This is the final straw.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)July 16, 2024



Musk said in a follow-up post that he would also relocate X, formerly Twitter, from San Francisco to Austin, saying he had “had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building”.

Musk, the world’s richest man, has in recent years gravitated towards Texas, which has no state corporate or income tax and is known for its conservative politics.

In 2021, Musk shifted Tesla’s headquarters from Palo Alto in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, and changed his residence from California to Texas.

Tesla, the world’s most valuable car company, still maintains an “engineering headquarters” in California.

Musk has become increasingly outspoken about his political views since taking over X in 2022, often taking aim at policies and public figures he considers excessively left-wing, or “woke”.

Musk on Saturday announced that he was endorsing Donald Trump for president shortly after the Republican candidate narrowly survived an attempted assassination.

California is considered one of the most liberal US states, with the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature controlled by the Democratic Party.

Texas has long been a conservative stronghold, with all three branches of the state government held by the Republican Party.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/7/17/elon-musk-says-he-will-move-companies-out-of-california-over-trans-law
Elon musk,Elon Musk takes stand in trial over Tesla purchase of SolarCity,"Tesla founder Elon Musk took the witness stand Monday to defend his company’s 2016 acquisition of a troubled company called SolarCity against a lawsuit that claims he’s to blame for a deal that was rife with conflicts of interest and never delivered the profits he’d promised.

And to the surprise of no one, the famously colourful billionaire did so in the most personally combative terms.









“I think you are a bad human being,” Musk told Randall Baron, a lawyer for shareholders who was pressing Musk to acknowledge his mistakes in helping engineer the acquisition of SolarCity, a manufacturer of solar panels.

“I have great respect for the court,” Musk later added, “but not for you, sir.’’

The long-running shareholder lawsuit asserts that Musk, who was SolarCity’s largest stakeholder and its chairman, and other Tesla directors breached their fiduciary duties in bowing to Musk’s wishes and agreeing to buy the company. In what the plaintiffs call a clear conflict of interest, SolarCity had been founded by Musk and two of his cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive.

In the Delaware Court of Chancery in the United States on Monday, Baron aimed to establish that Musk has sought to run Tesla without interference and therefore bears responsibility for any failures. The lawyer showed a video clip in which Musk said he liked running his own companies because he doesn’t want anyone to make him do what he doesn’t want to do.

As an example of what he characterised as Musk’s imperious management style, Baron mentioned that the CEO once declared himself “Technoking of Tesla’’ and gave his chief financial officer the title “master of coin’’ — a reference to HBO’s “Game of Thrones” — in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

The hostility between the billionaire CEO and the plaintiffs’ lawyer dates to at least 2019 and a deposition in which Musk insulted Baron and questioned his professionalism. On Monday, Baron played clips from that deposition to try to portray Musk’s stance toward what he might regard as criticism.

Pushing back, Musk insisted Monday that “I don’t want to be the boss of anything.”

“I prefer to spend my time on design and engineering,’’ he said.

Musk, who is well-known for rejecting scepticism of himself or his company, insisted that he welcomes criticism:

“If I’m mistaken,” he said on the witness stand, “I view critical feedback as a gift.’’

Musk said his offbeat titles and other quips simply reflect his sense of humour.

“I think I’m funny,’’ he offered.

What’s more, he said, the resulting media attention often plays to Tesla’s benefit.

“If we’re entertaining, people will write stories about us, and the company can save on advertising.”

Regarding Tesla’s all-stock acquisition of SolarCity, Musk asserted that he had nothing to gain financially from it because he owned shares of both companies.

Musk also argued that SolarCity’s failure to meet aggressive sales forecasts and its loss of market share were only temporary setbacks. He said they reflected his decision to divert Tesla resources towards salvaging production of the Tesla Model 3 electric car – and then running “headlong into a pandemic’’.

The effort to salvage Tesla 3 was “all-hands-on-deck’’ operation – so desperate that even the company’s lawyers were enlisted in the effort, Musk said, drawing laughter in the court.

Musk’s defence noted that SolarCity had been in Tesla’s plans as early as his 2006 master plan for the electric carmaker. In saying so, he asserted that the joining of the companies 10 years later wasn’t an emergency bailout, as the plaintiffs have alleged.

But Baron pointed out that the 2006 document mentioned only a potential marketing arrangement, not a full-fledged merger or acquisition, between Tesla and SolarCity.

Seven shareholder lawsuits, consolidated into one, alleged that Tesla directors breached their fiduciary duties in bowing to Musk’s wishes and agreeing to buy the struggling company. Last August, a judge approved a $60m settlement that resolved claims made against all the directors on Tesla’s board except Musk without any admission of fault. That left Musk, who refused to settle, as the sole remaining defendant. The trial that begins Monday had been scheduled for March of last year but was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, has called the acquisition a “clear black eye” for Musk and Tesla, in large part because SolarCity has failed to turn a profit.

“It basically was putting good money after bad,” Ives said. “For all the successes and all of the unimaginable heights Musk has achieved, this is one of the lowlights.”

Even if the trial ends with Musk having to pay personally for the whole SolarCity deal, $2.5bn won’t much hurt the world’s third-wealthiest person. Forbes magazine has estimated that Musk is worth roughly $163bn.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/7/12/elon-musk-set-to-testify-over-tesla-purchase-of-solarcity
Elon musk,"Zelenskyy, Musk in Twitter showdown over Ukraine ‘peace’ plan","A poll by the outspoken billionaire Elon Musk asking Twitter users to weigh in on a plan to end the Ukraine war has sparked a flurry of criticism, including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The controversial “peace” proposal put forward by the entrepreneur behind Tesla Inc and SpaceX included United Nations-supervised elections in thefour Ukrainian regionsrecently annexed by Russia, and recognising Crimea as Russian territory.

Ukraine-Russia Peace:

– Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.

– Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).

– Water supply to Crimea assured.

– Ukraine remains neutral.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)October 3, 2022



Crimea, which was occupied by Russia in 2014, is strategically important for its access to the Black Sea.

Most nations recognise Crimea as an autonomous region within Ukraine and reject Russia’s annexation of the territory as illegal.

The initial four-point proposal was amended later on Monday in a subsequent tweet asking users if they would support another referendum in Crimea – the last one, which was widely condemned as illigitemate, was held in 2014.

Musk has previously shown solidarity with Ukraine and provided through his company SpaceXequipment for its Starlink internet service, so that the war-torn country could maintain online access to the rest of the world.

But Ukrainians viewed his proposals as a betrayal of his earlier support.

Zelenskyy replied by launching a Twitter poll accusing Musk of contradicting himself.

Which@elonmuskdo you like more?

— Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)October 3, 2022



Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, had a blunt response to Musk’s initial poll.

“F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk,” he wrote on Twitter.

Musk responded to Zelenskyy in a public tweet late on Monday, saying he still supported Ukraine but feared the consequences of escalating the war.

“This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then,” Musk said.

“Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war,” he added.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda weighed in on the dispute between Ukraine and the Tesla CEO.

“Dear @elonmusk when someone tries to steal the wheels of your Tesla, it doesn’t make them legal owner of the car or of the wheels. Even though they claim both voted in favour of it. Just saying,” he tweeted.

Musk then sent out a third tweet arguing that Russia would go into “full war mobilisation”, as opposed to thepartial mobilisationannounced on September 21, if Crimea was at risk.

“Death on both sides will be devastating,” he said.

“Russia has >3 times population of Ukraine, so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine, seek peace,” he said.

One user replied by launching a poll asking: “Who should decide Ukraine’s fate: Ukrainians or Elon Musk?”

The billionaire’s Tweets on Tuesday gained the appraisal of Moscow and its allies.

The Kremlin said it was a “positive step” that Musk was outlining a possible peace deal. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov also told reporters in a conference call that Moscow had always been open to a negotiated end to the conflict.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Musk “did well” and that he was “worthy of being awarded with a new officer rank”.

“Next post, he’ll say something along the lines of ‘Ukraine is an artificial state’,” he said on his Telegram channel.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces achieved theirbiggest breakthrough in the country’s southsince Russia invaded, pushing across Russian lines on Monday and advancing along the Dnieper river.

Musk is involved in a court battle over the purchase of Twitter, after the social media giant approved his $44bnofferto buy the company.

Elon musk,Jeff Bezos topples Elon Musk to reclaim title of world’s richest man,"Jeff Bezos has dethroned Elon Musk to reclaim his title as the world’s richest man.

The Amazon founder’s net worth currently stands at $200bn, topping the Tesla chief’s $198bn, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index showed on Tuesday.

Bezos has gained $23bn so far in 2024, while Musk has lost about $31bn, according to the index.

The billionaires’ wealth gains and losses closely tracked the stock market fortunes of Amazon and Tesla, who count their founders as their biggest shareholders.

Amazon’s share price has surged by more than 18 percent this year, while Tesla’s has dropped by 24 percent.

Despite selling $8.5bn worth of Amazon shares earlier this month, Bezos remains the biggest shareholder in the e-commerce giant with a 9.56 percent stake.

Musk has an equity stake in Tesla of about 20 percent.

In January, a judge in the United States struck down a Tesla pay package for Musk valued at up to $55.8bn after finding that the process for approving his remuneration was deeply flawed.

Musk, who also runs X and SpaceX, rose to the top of the rich list in May after toppling Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of luxury goods company LVMH, who now ranks third with $197bn.

Elon musk,US Election 2024,"Elon Musk’s claims about the risks of voter fraud in the United States presidential election prompted a flurry of concerned correspondence to election officials in a key swing state, newly released emails reveal.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO’s commentary on X prompted a Republican state senator and others in Pennsylvania, the most important battleground state with 19 Electoral College votes, to contact the top election official in one district to discuss concerns about overseas voting, according to the emails, which provide new insight into the billionaire’s behind-the-scenes effect on the vote.

The office of Senator Chris Gebhard in October contacted the director of elections for Lebanon County, a heavily Republican district located northwest of Philadelphia, to express the lawmaker’s “concerns with what is being communicated” about the November 5 election, the emails show.

“Can you help us out by giving us a statement? I dropped off one of the emails,” Daniel Bost, an aide to Gebhard, wrote in an October 10 email to Sean Drasher.

Bost provided Drasher with a “printout” of an X post by Musk by way of illustrating the senator’s concerns, according to an email Drasher sent to a state-level election official seeking advice on how to respond to the lawmaker.

Though it is not clear which of Musk’s posts the officials were referring to, Drasher said in his email to Jonathan Marks, Pennsylvania’s deputy secretary for elections and commissions, that it detailed “the Blue push to register overseas voters”, referring to the traditional colour of the Democratic Party.





Al Jazeera obtained the emails through a records request submitted under Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law.

In the run-up to the election, Musk, one of US President-elect Donald Trump’s most powerful allies, posted prolifically on X about the supposed risks of voter fraud.

Many of those posts included false or unsubstantiated claims, such as hundreds of thousands of migrants had been flown to swing states and put on a fast-track to citizenship as part of a plan to give Democrats an electoral advantage.

Although not involving Musk, Republicans filed lawsuits in multiple states, including Pennsylvania, casting doubt on the security of overseas voting in the weeks before the vote.

In late October, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit, in which six Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania called for new checks to confirm the identities of voters overseas, ruling that the lawmakers had no justifiable reason for making their claim so close to the election and had relied on “hypothetical concerns”.

Trump also singled out overseas voting for criticism during his campaign, falsely claiming that people overseas are sent ballots “without any citizenship check or verification of identity whatsoever”.

The outreach to Drasher prompted by Musk’s social media activity apparently left the election official conflicted about how to respond, in part because of his own concerns about overseas voting, according to the emails.

Drasher said that although the “tone and some of the details” of Musk’s posts did not seem credible to him, he himself had “real concerns” about the voter registration process.

“I don’t feel I can directly address Senator Gehbard [sic] without sounding foolish or uninformed,” Drasher wrote in an October 10 email to Marks.

“Ironically I’m now being confronted with something that I also wanted to call out. Could you help me understand? Or, would you be willing to address this with Sen Gebhard yourself and then fill me [in] so I also understand?”

Drasher reiterated his concerns about overseas voting registration the following day in an email to his Lebanon County colleagues.

“This puts us in a bit of an uncomfortable position because, frankly, I don’t like the UMOVA/UCOVA statutes myself,” he wrote, referring to legislation that facilitates overseas and military absentee voting.

“I want to see them changed. And in my opinion, some of the things you see out on Twitter end up being completely valid concerns. I take comfort in the fact that this affects a tiny number of voters; And in our County its [sic] barely statistically relevant.”

Drasher said that given the attention elected officials were paying to the issue, it would be “only a matter of hours before we start getting calls from constituents who will also be looking for answers”.

“I will bow to our excellent solicitor on this, but my own feedback is once again: We can only follow the law as written and we will happily enforce any changes as soon as the Legislature moves on them,” he wrote.



When contacted by Al Jazeera, Drasher said he could not remember the exact X post that had prompted the discussions in his office.

Asked to elaborate on his concerns about overseas voting, Drasher said it was his job to be concerned about “all” aspects of voter registration.

“My concern is that I need to more fully understand the process and rationale behind its structure,” he said.

Requests sent to X seeking Musk’s comment did not receive a response.

The Pennsylvania Department of State did not follow up on requests for comment.

About 4.4 million US citizens were living abroad in 2022, about 2.8 million of whom were voting age, according to the Federal Voting Assistance Program.

Elon musk,Saudis ‘second largest investors’ in Twitter after Musk takeover,"Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Company (KHC), along with the private office of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, will continue their ownership of Twitter shares valued at $1.89bn afterElon Musk’s takeoverof the social media company, making them jointly the second largest investors, according to a statement released by theSaudi prince.

Bin Talal, who shared the statement on his Twitter account on Friday, and made reference to Musk as “Chief Twit”, stated that the deal was in line with the long-term strategy of KHC.

The company was founded by bin Talal, and is 16.9 percent owned by the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund.

As of January 2022, Saudi Arabia, with a population of 34.8 million, had the eighth most Twitter users of any country in the world, with more than 12 million users.

Musk, the richest person in the world, announced on Thursday that he had completed a$44bn acquisition.

“The bird is freed,” Musk tweeted, referencing Twitter’s bird logo in an apparent nod to his desire to see the company have fewer limits on content that can be posted.

However, the CEO of the electric car maker Tesla Inc, and self-described free speech absolutist, has also said he wants to prevent the platform from becoming an echo chamber for hate and division.

Musk fired Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and legal affairs and policy chief Vijaya Gadde, according to people familiar with the matter. He had accused them of misleading him and Twitter investors over the number of fake accounts on the platform.

Agrawal and Segal were in Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters when the deal closed and were escorted out, the sources added.

Musk, who also runs rocket company SpaceX, plans to become Twitter’s interim CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The acquisition marks the end of a long-running saga; Musk first offered to buy Twitter in April, before attempting to back out of the deal, and then eventually completing the purchase to take the social media company private.

In contrast to Friday’s statement, bin Talal had initially rejected Musk’s offer in April, saying it did not come close to the “intrinsic value” of Twitter.

At the time, Musk replied by asking what Saudi Arabia’s views on journalistic free speech were.

Elon musk,Trump pledges to tap Elon Musk to head government efficiency commission,"Former United States President Donald Trump has pledged to create a “government efficiency” commission headed by entrepreneur Elon Musk if he is victorious in seeking re-election this November.

Trump made the pledge as he laid out hiseconomic visionin a campaign speech at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.

Promises of economic prosperity have been a backbone of Trump’s re-election bid in 2024, and he used Thursday’s speech to showcase his plans for a “national economic renaissance”.

They include oft-repeated proposals to slash regulations on energy production, cut government spending and lower corporate taxes for US companies.

Less familiar were his plans to embrace cryptocurrency and create the Musk-led commission, which he said would eliminate “fraud and improper payments” within six months of being formed.

“I will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms,” Trump said.

The US government already has the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO), a federal watchdog agency tasked with investigating federal spending and performance. Trump did not offer details about the proposed new commission or how it would operate.







Still, the pledge was swiftly condemned by the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents about 750,000 federal workers.

In a statement to the Reuters news agency, Everett Kelley accused Trump and Musk of wanting to gut the nonpartisan civil service sector and replace fired workers with political allies.

“There’s nothing efficient about that,” Kelley said.

For his part, Musk wrote on X that he would accept the post if Trump were to win the November 5 election. He had previously said during a podcast in August that he had discussed the commission with Trump.

“I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises,” said Musk, who purchased the social media company X, then known as Twitter, in 2022. “No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.”

He quickly lifted Trump’s ban from the platform after acquiring it. He later endorsed Trump for president following anassassination attemptagainst the Republican leader in July.

The economy has emerged as a key issue in the 2024 presidential election, in which Trump is facing off against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate. That comes as US consumers continue to struggle with the cost of living, despite inflation slowing over the past two years.

Last month, Harris unveiled a populist-leaning economic vision that would ban “price gouging” on groceries. It also would boost first-time homebuyers, offer a child tax credit and create tax incentives for affordable home builders.

On Wednesday, she also said she would seek an increase to the capital gains tax for wealthy Americans — but that it would be lower than a similar increase proposed by President Joe Biden.

Harris plans to implement a 28 percent tax on investment profits for those in the highest income bracket, less than the 39.6 percent proposed by Biden. The move has been seen as an effort to broaden Harris’s appeal among the ultra-wealthy.







Speaking before several prominent CEOs on Thursday, Trump reiterated hisplanto cut the US corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 21 percent, but only for companies that manufacture domestically.

He also said he would open up tracts of federal land to homebuilding in a bid to drive down housing costs. These new housing zones would be “low tax” and “low regulation”, Trump said, without elaborating.

Polls have indicated that voters generally view Trump as better suited to handling the economy than Harris, although the pair remain neck and neck in national polls, as well as surveys of battleground states.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/5/trump-pledges-to-tap-elon-musk-to-head-government-efficiency-commission
Elon musk,"Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI may go to trial in part, judge says","A United States federal judge has said that parts of Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI to halt its conversion to a for-profit entity might go to trial, adding that the Tesla CEO will have to appear in court and testify.

“Something is going to trial in this case,” US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, said early in the court session on Tuesday.

“[Elon Musk will] sit on the stand, present it to a jury, and a jury will decide who is right.”

Rogers was considering Musk’s recent request for a preliminary injunction to block OpenAI’s conversion before going to trial, the latest move in a grudge match between the world’s richest person and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that is playing out publicly in court.

The last time Rogers provided a preliminary injunction was in Epic Games’s case against Apple in May 2021.

Musk co-founded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 but left before the company took off and subsequently founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023.

OpenAI is now trying to transition from a nonprofit into a for-profit entity, which itsaysit needs to do to secure the capital required to develop the best artificial intelligence models.

Last year, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman, saying that OpenAI’s founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it is now focused on making money.

He later expanded the lawsuit to add federal antitrust and other claims, and in December asked the judge presiding over the case to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a for-profit.

At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI’s CEO.

Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.

Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so, except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that removed him was replaced.

In response to Musk’s lawsuit, OpenAI has said it will move to dismiss Musk’s claims and that Musk “should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom”.

OpenAI has sought to demonstrate Musk’s early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.

The stakes on OpenAI’s corporate transition have now escalated, as OpenAI’s last fundraising round of $6.6bn and a new round of up to $25bn under discussion with SoftBank are conditioned on the company restructuring to remove the nonprofit’s control.

Such a restructuring would be highly unusual, said Rose Chan Loui, the executive director of the UCLA Law Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits. Nonprofit conversions to for-profits have historically been for healthcare organisations like hospitals, not venture capital-backed companies, she said.

Musk is not the only one challenging OpenAI’s for-profit transition. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms has asked California’s attorney general to block it, and the office of Delaware’s attorney general has said it is reviewing the conversion.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/4/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-may-go-to-trial-in-part-judge-says
Elon musk,South Africa leader calls Elon Musk over ‘distortions’ after Trump attack,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke to Elon Musk regarding “misinformation” about South Africa after US President Donald Trump said he would suspend aid to the country over its land reform policy.

South African-born billionaire Musk, who is close to Trump, waded into the dispute on Monday with a post on X accusing South Africa of having “openly racist ownership laws”, suggesting white people were the victims.

Trump on Sunday accused South Africa of confiscating land and badly treating “certain classes of people”.

Ramaphosa responded by saying the government had not confiscated any property and the policy is aimed at ensuring equitable public access to land.

The presidency said in a statement that Ramaphosa and Musk spoke on Monday “on issues of misinformation and distortions” about South Africa.

“In the process, the president reiterated South Africa’s constitutionally embedded values of the respect for the rule of law, justice, fairness and equality,” it said, giving no further details.

— The Presidency 🇿🇦 (@PresidencyZA)February 4, 2025



The US president had already announced a temporary freeze on almost all foreign assistance as part of his “America First” agenda, pausing billions of dollars in global funding.

Last month, Ramaphosa signed a bill into law that would make it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest to address racial disparities in land ownership after apartheid ended in 1994.

According to the government, the bill does not allow it to expropriate property arbitrarily; the landowner must reach an agreement.

Writing on Truth Social, Trump stated: “I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed.”

In response, South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said: “We trust President Trump’s advisers will make use of the investigative period to attain a thorough understanding of South Africa’s policies within the framework of a constitutional democracy.

“It may become clear that our expropriation act is not exceptional, as many countries have similar legislation.”

Ramaphosa added that except for the AIDS relief programme run by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), no other significant funding is provided to South Africa by the United States.

Elon musk,Elon Musk’s Tesla building giant battery to plug into Texas grid,"Elon Musk is getting into the Texas power market, with previously unrevealed construction of a gigantic battery connected to an ailing electric grid that nearly collapsed last month. The move marks Tesla Inc.’s first major foray into the epicenter of the U.S. energy economy.

A Tesla subsidiary registered as Gambit Energy Storage LLC is quietly building a more than 100 megawatt energy storage project in Angleton, Texas, a town roughly 40 miles south of Houston. A battery that size could power about 20,000 homes on a hot summer day. Workers at the site kept equipment under cover and discouraged onlookers, but a Tesla logo could be seen on a worker’s hard hat and public documents helped confirm the company’s role.

Property records on file with Brazoria County show Gambit shares the same address as a Tesla facility near the company’s auto plant in Fremont, California. A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lists Gambit as a Tesla subsidiary. Executives from Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

As winter storms pummeled Texas in February and left millions without power for days, Musk took to Twitter to mock the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, the nonprofit group that manages the flow of electric power to more than 26 million customers. “Not earning that R,” he wrote. Musk, 49, recently moved to Texas and his various companies are expanding operations in the state.

The battery-storage system being built by Tesla’s Gambit subsidiary is registered with Ercot. Warren Lasher, senior director of system planning at Ercot, said the project has a proposed commercial operation date of June 1. The site is adjacent to a Texas-New Mexico Power substation.

While Tesla is known for its sleek, battery-powered electric vehicles, it’s always been more than a car company: its official mission is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” Utility-scale batteries are needed to store the electricity produced by wind and solar, but they can also become lucrative opportunities. By storing excess electricity when prices and demand are low, battery owners can sell it back to the grid when prices are high.

Tesla has spent years expanding into residential energy technology. Back in March 2015, Musk unveiled a home battery product, dubbed the Powerwall, with a splashy event at its design studio near Los Angeles. Scores of utility and energy executives attended. A year later Tesla acquired SolarCity, the solar-panel installer founded by Musk and his cousins. Musk then hawked a “solar roof” that has gone through several iterations without becoming a strong contender in the market.

But the company’s product lineup already reaches beyond the home and into the electrical grid. The Tesla Powerpack and even larger Megapack were designed with utility customers in mind. Tesla’s battery project in South Australia, launched in 2017, is adjacent to a wind farm and can store surplus electricity generated on gusty nights for daytime demand. At 100 megawatts, it was the largest battery project in the world at its launch.

While Tesla’s focus on energy often takes a back seat to the increasingly competitive business of manufacturing and selling electric cars, Musk and his executive team continue to highlight energy as a key part of their growth. “I think long-term Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive,” Musk said during an earnings call in July 2020. “The energy business is collectively bigger than the automotive business.”

Tesla’s battery packs are connected to Southern California Edison’s Mira Loma substation, located east of Los Angeles. The 20 megawatt system, which has been online since December 2016, supports grid operation during peak hours and helps the utility make the most of its renewable resources. In the San Francisco Bay Area, PG&E Corp. and Tesla are constructing a 182.5 megawatt system at an electric substation in Moss Landing that should be operational by August.

Tesla Energy could represent up to 30% of the company’s total revenue by the 2030s, up from roughly 6% today, according to analyst Alexander Potter of Piper Sandler. His research has highlighted the potential for Autobidder, a software platform Tesla designed for utilities. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn has described Autobidder as an “autonomous energy market participation system that does high-frequency trading.” Potter has a $1,200 price target on Tesla stock, the highest on Wall Street.

“Tesla’s energy storage business on a percentage basis is growing faster than their car business, and it’s only going to accelerate,” said Daniel Finn-Foley, head of energy storage at Wood MacKenzie Power and Renewables. “They are absolutely respected as a player, and they are competing aggressively on price.”

Musk’s empire has numerous branches in Texas, and with the billionaire’s recent relocation from California, the Lone Star state now appears set to become the center of his universe. Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, is building and testing Starship, a new rocket and spacecraft designed to take humans to Mars, at a facility in Boca Chica on the southern tip of the Gulf Coast. Another rocket-testing facility is located in McGregor, near Waco.

SpaceX has posted engineering positions in Austin for a “new, state of the art manufacturing facility” for Starlink, a space-based high speed Internet service. Tesla is also building a new factory in East Austin for its forthcoming Cybertruck, an electric pickup. Gigafactory Texas, as the facility is known, will create 5,000 mid-level manufacturing jobs and is supposed to produce the first vehicles by the end of this year.

Musk’s focus on Texas comes as the dominant U.S. energy hub—with its abundant natural gas, oil, solar and wind resources—is being transformed by the surging growth of renewables. For more than a century the Texas grid has transported power from large plants to customers over miles of transmission lines. The recent storms have highlighted just how fragile that legacy system is in the era of climate change. With the build out of giant batteries like those made by Tesla’s Gambit project and others, the state’s power grid could be remade around distributed generation that may prove more resilient.

About 2,100 megawatts of battery storage and 37,000 megawatts of solar and wind are in advanced stages of connecting to Ercot’s grid. “It’s not only stunning but the financing is already in place,” Jigar Shah said on March 2, a day before the clean-energy pioneer was named as director of the U.S. Energy Department’s loan finance office.

The Gambit project was originally developed by San Francisco-based Plus Power, a privately held renewables company that has battery operations in several states. Scott Albert, the former city manager of Angleton, said it was obvious that Plus Power was working with Tesla. A project summary available on the city’s website features images of Tesla’s utility-scale battery products, and some of Plus Power’s principal staffers previously worked at Tesla. (Plus Power confirmed its sale of the project to an undisclosed party and declined further comment.)

The Gambit project is not hard to find in Angleton, a small town of roughly 3,000 people in the middle of the Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge. But people on the construction site appear to have instructions to avoid drawing attention or answering questions from passersby. A photographer who attempted to observe from the front gate was told by a worker that it was a “secretive project.” White sheets obscured what appeared to be Tesla’s modular Megapacks.

In Texas, Albert said, it’s common for developers in real estate or energy to begin projects with several potential partners or purchasers waiting in the wings. It made sense to him that the project ended up with the state’s biggest billionaire. “Elon Musk has a lot of activity in Texas right now,” said Albert. “It wouldn’t surprise me if Musk is thinking about starting his own power company.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/8/elon-musks-tesla-building-giant-battery-to-plug-into-texas-gri
Elon musk,Elon Musk to give $45m a month to pro-Trump election group: Report,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has said he plans to donate approximately $45m each month to a new super political-action committee (Super PAC) supportingDonald Trump‘s election bid, according to a United States media report.

Musk’s donations will go to a group dubbed America PAC, which will focus on supporting Trump by promoting voter registration, early voting and mail-in ballots among residents in swing states ahead of the November general election, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter.

Musk formally endorsed Trump’s candidacy for US president on Saturday after the former president surviveda shooting at a political rallyin Pennsylvania.

“I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk wrote on the social media platform X, which he acquired in 2022 when it was known as Twitter.

According to the report, Musk plans to start donating next month.

Musk, the wealthiest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $250bn, has grown increasingly friendly with Trump over the course of the2024 US election.

In March, the two met in person during a donor breakfast hosted at the Florida residence of billionaire Nelson Peltz.

Though individual campaign donations in the US are capped at $3,300 per person, loopholes in the US campaign finance system allow political mega-donors to contribute to funds known as political action committees, better known as “PACs,” which support candidates.

America PAC has hired hundreds of employees for its efforts to get Trump elected, and has been registering voters, having conversations with constituents in swing states and urging voters to request mail-in ballots, some of the people familiar with the matter said.

Elon musk,Hamas invites Elon Musk to Gaza to witness ‘massacres and destruction’,"Hamas invited Elon Musk to the Gaza Strip to witness the scope of the devastation caused by Israel’s bombardment, but the tech billionaire said it was “dangerous there right now”.

The invitation from senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan came on Tuesday.

Seems a bit dangerous there right now, but I do believe that a long-term prosperous Gaza is good for all sides

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)November 28, 2023



“Seems a bit dangerous there right now, but I do believe that a long-term prosperous Gaza is good for all sides,” Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns.

He hadvisiteda kibbutz the previous day that was targeted by Hamas gunmen during theOctober 7 attackin southern Israel and declared his commitment to do whatever was necessary to stop the spread of hatred.

Hamdan called on Musk, who recently met Israel’s prime minister and president, to also visit Palestine and acquire a more rounded perspective.

“We invite him to visit Gaza to see the extent of the massacres and destruction committed against the people of Gaza, in compliance with the standards of objectivity and credibility,” Hamdan said in a press conference in Beirut.

“Within 50 days, Israel dropped more than 40,000 tonnes of explosives on the homes of defenceless Gazans,” the official added.

Musk has recently facedcriticismthat his social media platform is rife withanti-Semitismand white nationalist rhetoric promoting violence and hatred.

During his visit to Israel, Musk expressed shock upon seeing the decimated kibbutz ofKfar Aza,saying that Israel had“no choice” but to eliminate Hamas.

He also struck an agreement under which “Starlink satellite units [would] only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications, including the Gaza Strip,” a sharp turn from his previousmusing that he could provide Starlinkto enhance communications in Gaza amid numerous telecommunications blackouts.

The Hamas official also called on the United States “to review [its] relationship with Israel and to stop supplying them with weapons,” and for the international community to quickly send specialised civil defence teams to help retrieve thousands of bodies from beneath the rubble.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/hamas-invites-elon-musk-to-gaza-to-see-the-destruction-with-his-own-eyes
Elon musk,Russia’s Putin praises Elon Musk days after Ukraine Starlink controversy,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed tech billionaire Elon Musk as an “outstanding person” and businessman whose SpaceX company has become a key player in the space transportation industry.

Putin’s public praise of Musk on Tuesday comes days after the South African-born and United States-based entrepreneur said herefused a Ukrainian requestlast year to activate his Starlink satellite communication network in the Russian-annexed Crimean port city of Sevastopol to aid an attack on Russia’s Black Sea fleet, saying he feared complicity in a “major” act of war.

Putin, speaking at an economic forum in Russia’s Far East, did not refer to the Starlink controversy. But when asked about the success of Musk’s SpaceX company in launching rockets into space, he was full of praise.

“As far as private business and Elon Musk is concerned… he is undoubtedly an outstanding person. This must be recognised, and I think it is recognised all over the world,” Putin said.

“He [Musk] is an active and talented businessman and he is succeeding a lot, including with the support of the American state,” he added.







Putin also offered a defence of former US President Donald Trump and the multiple criminal cases that he is facing.

The charges against Trump show the “rottenness of the American political system”, Putin said at the forum.

“What is happening with Trump is a persecution of a political rival for political motives.”

Trump is facing several separate criminal cases in the US, including being charged in federal court in Washington, DC with attempted election fraud over his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In a Georgia state court, he is charged with election interference and in federal court in Florida, he faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.









Earlier this month, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, one of the most hawkish voices in the Kremlin when it comes to Ukraine and the potential for a widening conflict with the West, also took to the Musk-owned X social media platform, previously known as Twitter, to praise Musk’s actions regarding Starlink, Crimea and Ukraine’s forces.

Medvedev described Musk as “the last adequate mind in North America”.

Ukrainian officials have criticised Musk’s decision to protect the Russian fleet from attack by Ukraine and US Democratic Party Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for an investigation of Musk’s actions.

The US Congress should investigate “whether we have adequate tools to make sure foreign policy is conducted by the government and not by one billionaire”, Warren said on Monday, according to the Bloomberg news agency.

Musk’s SpaceX firmwon a contractfrom the US Department of Defense to provide Ukraine with Starlink satellite communication services.

Russia, which seized the strategic Crimean Peninsula in 2014 from Ukraine, bases its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and has used the fleet to blockade Ukrainian ports since its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.

The Russian fleet also fires cruise missiles at Ukrainian civilian targets. Kyiv has launched attacks on Russian ships using maritime drones.

In a post on X last week, Musk said he had no choice but to reject an emergency request from Ukraine “to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol”.

Musk did not give the date of the request and the excerpt did not specify it.

Much appreciated, Walter.

The onus is meaningfully different if I refused to act upon a request from Ukraine vs. made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine.

At no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea.

Moreover, our terms of service clearly…https://t.co/jmNtScM5LY

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)September 9, 2023



“The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor,” Musk wrote.

Elon musk,‘This guy is dangerous’: British Pakistanis fear Musk is stoking racism,"London, United Kingdom –Azmat Khan, a British Pakistani taxi driver, is not usually much of a worrier.

But recently, as he drives his cab at night through London’s ice-cold streets, he has become increasingly anxious.

“We’ve just had asummer of unrestwithmisinformationfuelling far-right activists in this country, partly thanks to X, and now he’s back, fanning the flames again,” Khan said of the South-Africa born tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has used the social media platform he owns to rage about British sexual abuse convicts of Pakistani heritage.

“This guy’s dangerous, and yes, I’m worried,” Khan, a 35-year-old father of three, told Al Jazeera, sharing his fears of collective punishment.

“Our community has seen through this kind of scapegoating before. But with Musk’s platform and resources, the threat has reached an entirely new level.”

Khan tunes in to the pulse of the city through his passengers and says he has noticed a troubling shift in back-seat conversations.

Some passengers have talked about what they called the “threats” Muslims and migrants bring to the UK.

That type of discourse could be linked to Musk’s inflammatory comments about historic cases of child sex abuse, Khan believes.

“That was a horrific time when the news first came out more than a decade ago,” Khan said. “But to bring it up again now, while it’s being dealt with, and to finger-point at Pakistani Muslims specifically – it’s obvious he’s trying to cause trouble, a move towards the civil war he was trying to stir up last summer.”

In August last year, after three girls were killed in Southport, online agitators blamed the attack on a Muslim migrant. But 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana, who wassentenced this weekto 52 years in jail, was neither a Muslim nor a migrant. The false claims led to widespread riots. Responding to footage posted on X of the riots, Musk posted: “Civil war is inevitable.”

In recent weeks, Musk has turned his focus to child sexual assault cases that took place over several decades in northern English towns such as Rochdale, Oldham, and Telford.

As well as sharing grim details of the cases involving British Pakistani men, several of them taxi drivers, Musk has called for a new national inquiry, amplified posts that suggest dual national convicts should be stripped of their UK citizenship, and targeted Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government, accusing politicians of a “cover-up”.

While some child sex abuse cases have involved several men of British Pakistani origin, it is impossible to suggest British Pakistanis are more likely to commit the crime.

Shabna Begum, head of Runnymede Trust, a racial equality think tank, said there was “no conclusive evidence which demonstrates an ethnic disproportionality in those who perpetrate this violence”.

A UK Home Office report in 2020 supported this view.

“By propelling misinformation, he’s creating mistrust and a volatile environment,” Begum said. “It purposefully stokes fear, prejudice, and division with no care for the victims and survivors of this violence, and makes no effort to address the real problems of misogyny and child sexual abuse.”

According to the Centre of expertise on child sexual abuse (CSA Centre), in 2022, 83 percent of defendants proceeded against for child sexual abuse offences were white, while 2 percent were of Pakistani backgrounds.

The centre used data from children’s social care, policing, criminal justice and health departments to build its report, but cautioned that the overrepresentation of white defendants “is likely to be related to the overall under-identification of child sexual abuse in minority ethnic communities”.

But Musk seems intent on painting a distorted picture, instead doubling down on a divisive and misleading narrative, said Khan.

Heregularlyrails against Prime Minister Starmer, a former chief prosecutor and head of the Crown Prosecution Service.

“Starmer was complicit in the RAPE OF BRITAIN when he was head of Crown Prosecution for 6 years,” Musk has posted on X.

The government has repeatedly dismissed calls for a second national inquiry. However, last weekit announceda plan to fund five new local inquiries, including one in Oldham.

The UK’s seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse (2014-2021) was one of the most comprehensive investigations of its kind.

Its final report, published in October 2022, drew on extensive research, multiple investigations, and victim testimonies. The report revealed systemic failures in protecting children and made powerful recommendations to improve safeguarding and accountability.

Even so, critics argue that the true scale of abuse committed was neglected for years.

“The real issue is creating a society that protects young girls from predators of any background,” Khan said. “But Musk isn’t interested in solutions – he’s interested in scapegoating one community. It doesn’t bode well for Britain or even Europewhere he’s also been meddling.”







In Rochdale, where British Pakistanis make up about 14 percent of the population, some are weary of being vilified.

“Most of us are working-class, honest folk,” said Mohammed Sheraz, a 48-year-old “Rochdalian”, as he described himself.

Born and raised in the town, he added, “We’re tired of being portrayed as troublesome Muslims or brown men to be scared of. Yes, some men committed disgusting crimes, but they were as far from Islam as you can get. They are criminals and should be treated as criminals. They don’t represent us in any way.”

Sheraz, who has for years run the Army of Kindness – a soup kitchen in Rochdale that serves people of all backgrounds – views Musk’s interventions as dangerous.

“It’s like he’s sowing the seeds for some major anti-Muslim war,” he said.

Rochdale remained calm over the summer as xenophobic riots erupted elsewhere, a sense of peace that Sheraz attributed to the resilience of the British public.

“Remember what stopped those riots from escalating: People of all races and backgroundsstood togetheragainst the right-wing thuggery that Musk seems determined to support.”

Musk’s endorsement of the jailed far-right activist Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, has been particularly contentious.

A figure synonymous with anti-Muslim sentiment in the UK, Robinson is currently serving a prison sentence for contempt of court.

Musk hascalled for Robinson’s releaseand portrayed him as a champion of free speech, drawing widespread condemnation.

Nigel Farage and Richard Tice, who lead the populist Reform Party that Musk has previously flirted with, have distanced themselves from Robinson.

Even so, Musk’s rhetoric has emboldened fringe movements. His posts echo the language of far-right activists, conflating cultural integration with a rise in criminality.

His influence – as one of the world’s richest men and an adviser to the new United States administration led by President Donald Trump – worries Sheraz.

“Tommy Robinson has been to Rochdale before in 2011 to stoke up hate, divide and conquer, it didn’t work. The community stood together to ensure our town didn’t go up in flames … But now Mr. Tesla is backing those folks. Who knows what’ll happen next?”

Begum at Runnymede described Musk’s rhetoric as “dangerous and irresponsible”, especially following the “worst racist rioting the UK has seen in generations”.

“Victims of child sexual abuse deserve justice, and of course, all children must be protected from sexual violence and exploitation – that goes without saying,” Begum said.

“What we are witnessing are powerful men exploiting horrendous sexual violence against women to score political points and push their own agendas.

“Focusing on Pakistani Muslim men and advocating for deportation or citizenship stripping is a thinly veiled attempt to racialise what is fundamentally a gendered issue.”

As the UK grapples with Musk’s growing influence, unity should be the strongest defence against a divisive agenda, said Sheraz.

Elon musk,Falcon Heavy rocket: What is it and why you should care,"SpaceX,a private US aerospace manufacturer owned by Elon Musk,has successfully launched its new Falcon Heavy spacecraft, making it the world’s most powerful rocket.

Below we answer some of the most asked questions about the launch.

Falcon Heavy is the largest rocket since NASA’s Saturn V booster, which was used for the Moon missions in the 1970s.

It is essentially constructed from three Falcon 9s bolted together side-by-side.

“Falcon Heavy can launch about 64 tonnes into low Earth orbit – that’s almost a factor three more than the current running biggest launch vehicle, Delta IV Heavy,” Imperial College astrophysicist David Clements told Al Jazeera.

According to SpaceX, Falcon Heavy can lift into orbit a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel.

Falcon Heavy sends a car to Marshttps://t.co/Y7uBtU6Mt2

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)February 5, 2018



The rocket was designed with the idea of carrying humans into space and opening the possibility of flying missions with people to the Moon and even Mars.

Musk mused that “it may be discovered by some future alien race”, adding that the white spacesuit was real.

SpaceX will charge $90m for its launch services in a Falcon Heavy.

It was delayed by several hours because of high winds in the upper atmosphere. Minutes after take-off, the two outer boosters landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

Commenting on the launch, Musk said:

I had this image of this giant explosion on the pad, with wheels bouncing down the road and the logo landing somewhere with a thud. But fortunately, that’s not what happened, crazy things come true.

SpaceX announced plans to eventually use Falcon Heavy to launch two paying space tourists on a trip around the Moon. However, Musk said he will probably reserve that mission for another launch system, the BFR.

Elon musk,French newspapers take legal action against Elon Musk’s X over content use,"Several major French newspapers have decided to take legal action against social media giant X, accusing the platform of using their content without paying.

The joint action on Tuesday includes Le Monde, Le Figaro, Les Echos, Le Parisien, Telerama, Courrier International, Huffington Post, Malesherbes Publications and Le Nouvel Obs.

The media outlets said they were due payment under their ancillary rights, which under a European directive adopted into French law are due when social media platforms republish news content.

They said X, formerly known as Twitter, has never agreed to open negotiations with French news publishers unlike Alphabet Inc’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.

They also said X, which is owned bybillionaire Elon Musk, has not complied with an order issued by the Paris Court of Justice in May to release information required to calculate the amount owed.

“The revenue from these rights, with the investment that it would enable its beneficiaries to make, is a boost to the plurality, independence and quality of the media, which are essential for freedom of expression and the right to information in our democratic society,” the newspapers said in a statement.

A spokesperson for the Paris tribunal confirmed the case and said a hearing was scheduled for May 15.

In a similar case,the AFP news agency said in Augustthat it was taking legal action against X before the Judicial Court of Paris.

AFP expressed concern “over the clear refusal from Twitter (recently rebranded as ‘X’) to enter into discussions regarding the implementation of neighbouring rights for the press”, a statement published by the French news agency said.

These rights were established to enable news agencies and publishers to be remunerated by digital platforms that retain most of the monetary value generated by the distribution of news content, it added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/12/french-newspapers-take-legal-action-against-elon-musks-x-over-content-use
Elon musk,Musk launches artificial intelligence rival to ChatGPT’s OpenAI,"Elon Musk has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) company to challenge ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which the billionaire tech mogul has accused of being “woke”.

On Wednesday, xAI said the goal of the new company would be to “understand the true nature of the universe”.

“What are the most fundamental unanswered questions?” xAI said on Twitter, which is owned by Musk.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said in a tweet that his company would seek to “understand reality”.

xAI’s staff includes former employees of OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Tesla, DeepMind and the University of Toronto, according to the company’s website.

Dan Hendrycks, the director of the Center for AI Safety, is advising the company, according to its website. Hendrycks earlier this year organised an open letter warning that AI could pose existential risks to humanity, a concern echoed by Musk.

Musk helped to co-found OpenAI in 2015 but left the San Francisco-based startup in 2018 over what he has described as a conflict of interest related to his work on AI at electric carmaker Tesla.

Musk, who has taken aim at the “woke mind virus” in society, has since accused the firm’s groundbreaking language bot ChatGPT of being biased in favour of left-wing and politically correct views.

Since buying Twitter for $44bn in October, Musk, a self-described free speech absolutist, has loosened moderation rules and reinstated previously banned right-wing accounts, which critics say has led to a surge in hate speech and extremism on the platform.

In April, Musk expressed his intention to launch a rival chatbot called TruthGPT.

Musk told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview that the new chatbot would be a “maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/7/13/musk-launches-artificial-intelligence-rival-to-chatgpts-openai
Elon musk,Here’s Elon Musk’s proposal to buy Twitter – in his own words,"A filing from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has disclosed Elon Musk’s message to Twitter’s Chairman Bret Taylor, as he made an offer tobuy the social media company.

Below is a full transcript of a voice message and a letter Musk sent to Taylor where he specifies his conditions and his proposal.

[SENT VIA TEXT]

As I indicated this weekend, I believe that the company should be private to go through the changes that need to be made.

After the past several days of thinking this over, I have decided I want to acquire the company and take it private.

I am going to send you an offer letter tonight; it will be public in the morning.

Are you available to chat?

[Voice Script]

1.Best and Final

a) I am not playing the back-and-forth game.

b) I have moved straight to the end.

c) It’s a high price and your shareholders will love it.

d) If the deal doesn’t work, given that I don’t have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.

i) This is not a threat; it’s simply not a good investment without the changes that need to be made.

ii) And those changes won’t happen without taking the company private.

I made an offerhttps://t.co/VvreuPMeLu

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)April 14, 2022



2. My advisers and my team are available after you get the letter to answer any questions.

a) There will be more detail in our public filings. After you receive the letter and review the public filings, your team can call my family office with any questions.

I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.

However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.

As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced. My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.

Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/14/heres-elon-musks-proposal-to-buy-twitter-in-his-own-words
Elon musk,"Elon Musk’s Israel trip: What was the purpose, what did he tell Netanyahu?","Billionaire tycoon Elon Musk, who has been accused of platforming anti-Semitic content on his social media platform X, on Monday met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during hisvisit to Israel.

Accompanied by Netanyahu, the tech billionaire also visited a kibbutz that wasraided by Hamasfighters on October 7, during an assault that left 1,200 people dead and triggered Israel’s deadliest-ever military assault on Gaza. Nearly 15,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s bombardment of the coastal enclave.

Musk was said to have backed Israel’s war on Gaza after the trip that came during the truce between Hamas and Israel.

Musk also agreed to not provide internet access to Gaza through his satellite company Starlink without Israeli approval.

Here is what to know about Musk’s visit to Israel and its significance.

Musk’s visit to Israel, which came amid a truce between Hamas and Israel, follows backlash against a post on X that many have labelled asanti-Semitic,triggering a wave of advertisement withdrawals from the platform by corporate giants such as Apple and IBM, potentially costing X millions of dollars.

Earlier this month, Musk agreed with a social media post accusing Jewish people of pushing “dialectical hatred” against white people. Musk’s remarks received condemnation in the United States from the White House for being “abhorrent”.

Musk has also been accused of allowing advertisements from major corporations next to neo-Nazi and white nationalist content.

X is also facing a probe from the European Union into the spread of disinformation and violent content about Israel’s war on Gaza.

Musk has either criticised or denied findings from organisations such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Center for Countering Digital Hate that X has witnessed an increase in hate speech since he became CEO last year.

X has sued Media Matters after accusing the media watchdog of manipulating an algorithm to drive away advertisers.

The watchdog has called the lawsuit “frivolous”.

Escorted by Netanyahu and other security personnel, Musk toured the Kfar Aza kibbutz, attacked by Hamas fighters on October 7. He was also shown footage of the Hamas attack and met some of the families of people takeninto captivityfrom Israel.

“It was jarring to see the scene of the massacre,” said Musk later in an X Spaces conversation with Netanyahu, adding Israel has “no choice” but to eliminate Hamas.

In the brief life-streamed conversation on X, Musk and Netanyahu agreed that Hamas needs to be eradicated – a mission that Israel has used as justification for its military offensive that has claimed overwhelmingly civilian lives.

“You first have to get rid of the poisonous regime as you did in Germany, as you did in Japan. Yeah, in World War II,” said Netanyahu.

Musk replied, “There’s no choice. There’s no choice.”

Israeli President Isaac Herzog told Musk during a meeting that he had a huge role to play in the global fight against anti-Semitism.

“We have to do whatever is necessary to stop the hate,” Musk replied, according to a statement released by Herzog’s office.

On the X space, Netanyahu said that Musk’s visit to Israel points to his solidarity with Israel.

“The fact that you came here, I think, speaks volumes to your commitment to try to secure a better future”, he said.

Netanyahu reminded Musk that the last time they spoke, the two had a conversation about artificial intelligence. He told the tech CEO that “great talents are available” in Israel and pointed to Israeli manufacturing of iPhones and operations of the navigation app, Waze.

Netanyahu previouslymet Muskin California on September 18 where the Israeli prime minister urged him to strike a balance between protecting free expression and fighting hate speech after weeks of controversy over anti-Semitism on X.

Musk responded by saying he was against anti-Semitism and against anything that “promotes hate and conflict”, repeating his previous statements that X would not promote hate speech.

An Israeli government source described Monday’s visit as a follow-up to the September meeting.

Musk’s visit to Israel is being criticised by some supporters of Israel and Palestine.

Esther Solomon, editor-in-chief of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, blasted Musk’s trip as a “PR visit” in a post on X.

In an opinion piece on the news site, Haaretz correspondent Ben Samuels alsosaidIsrael’s embrace of Musk is a “betrayal of Jews” and a “stain on Netanyahu’s legacy”.

Musk has also been questioned online for not visiting Gaza despite the deaths and destruction wrought on the territory by Israeli bombs.

Blatant antisemite & publisher of antisemitism Elon Musk should be persona non grata in Israel. Instead, Netanyahu – plumbing new depths of amoral sycophancy – gifts him a PR visit to the kibbutzim devastated by Hamas. Profane, venal, bilious, both of themhttps://t.co/zGc10w8Y9Hpic.twitter.com/XMkitJclUt

Musk reachedan agreementwith Israel “in principle” that internet access to Gaza may be provided through Starlink, but only using units operated by Israel and with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications.

In October, CEO Musk had said that “Starlink will support connectivity to internationally recognised aid organisations in Gaza.”

As Gaza plunged into darkness after its communicationsblackout in October, social media users pleaded with Musk to provide the besieged enclave with internet access through Starlink.

The company uses satellite technology instead of cable technology to provide internet access, and also came to the aid ofUkrainewhen the country faced its own blackouts during its war with Russia.

Musk’s instant provision of Starlink access to Ukraine prompted people to call him out for having “double standards” when it came to Israel’s war on Gaza.

Israel has also previously opposed Starlink connectivity for Gaza, contesting that Hamas would use it for “terrorist activities”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/elon-musks-israel-trip-what-was-the-purpose-what-did-he-tell-netanyahu
Elon musk,‘I love you guys!’: Elon Musk lands $44.9bn pay deal after Tesla vote,"Elon Musk has won back his $44.9bn pay package at electric carmaker Tesla after shareholders voted to restore the compensation deal in a ringing endorsement of his leadership.

The vote at Tesla’s annual meeting on Thursday came after ajudge in the US state of Delaware threw out the dealafter finding that the company’s board was too close to Musk and had not protected shareholders’ interests.

“I just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys!” a jubilant Musk said as he appeared on stage after the vote.

“We have the most awesome shareholder base. I mean it’s just incredible.”

Musk’s pay deal was valued at about $56bn at the peak of Tesla’s share price in late 2021 but has since declined in value by about one-quarter in tandem with a drop in the company’s stock price.

The shareholders’ vote does not necessarily mean Musk will receive the pay package but could bolster Tesla’s appeal against the Delaware ruling against the deal.

In her January decision, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick described the pay package as “unfathomable”.

“Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside,’ or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” McCormick wrote in her decision.

Musk, who founded Tesla in 2003, does not receive a salary for leading the carmaker.

Under the terms of his 2018 pay deal, Musk agreed to be paid stock worth about 1 percent of Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of its operational and financial goals.

While Tesla’s business has soared under Musk’s leadership, at one point taking the company’s market value to $1.24 trillion, sales have slowed sharply amid growing competition from Chinese EV makers.

Musk has also attracted controversy with his outspoken views on politics and battled perceptions that he is spread too thin due to his involvement in six companies, including rocket company SpaceX and social media platform X.

Tesla shares rose 0.7 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, after earlier gaining 2.9 percent following Musk’s announcement on social media that investors backed the deal.

Prior to Thursday’s vote, Musk had expressed doubts about his future at Tesla.

In January, Musk said in a post on X that he would prefer to build artificial intelligence and robotics products outside of Tesla if he could not have a 25 percent stake in the company.

Musk is already by far Tesla’s largest shareholder, holding more than 20 percent of its equity.

Tesla shareholders on Thursday also approved proposals to move the company’s incorporation from Delaware to Texas and reappoint Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch – Musk’s brother and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch’s son, respectively – to the company’s board.

Tesla did not announce the vote tallies, but several large institutional investors had opposed the deal, including Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/6/14/i-love-you-guys-elon-musk-lands-44-9bn-pay-deal-after-tesla-vote
Elon musk,Elon Musk denies selling Starlink to Russia after Ukraine claims use in war,"Elon Musk has denied selling his Starlink internet service to Russia after Ukraine claimed the terminals were being used by Russian troops on the front lines of the war.

“A number of false news reports claim that SpaceX is selling Starlink terminals to Russia. This is categorically false,” Musk, who leads SpaceX and several other companies including Tesla, said in the post on X on Monday.

“To the best of our knowledge, no Starlinks have been sold directly or indirectly to Russia.”

Moscow also rejected Kyiv’s claim that Starlink terminals had been smuggled into Russia and were being used on a “systematic” basis in Russian-occupied Donetsk.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Starlink is not certified for use in Russia.

“It cannot be officially supplied here and is not officially supplied here,” Peskov told reporters on Monday.

On Sunday,Ukraine’s military intelligence agency GUR said that intercepted conversations among Russian forces revealed that Starlink terminals had been deployed among troops operating near the towns of Klishchiivka and Andriivka.

GUR spokesman Andriy Yusov said on state TV that Starlink terminals were entering Russia through parallel importing, not official channels.

Starlink said in a post on X last week that it “does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military” and the service “will not work” in the country.

Ukraine’s military has credited Starlink for allowing its forces to communicate, gather intelligence and coordinate attacks more quickly and securely than would be possible using radio or phone communications.

Last year, Musk came under scrutiny after it emerged that he had refused a request by Ukraine to activate Starlink to assist in a surprise attack on Russia’s fleet in Crimea’s port of Sevastopol.

Musk said he had refused the request, which was first reported in extracts of Walter Isaacson’s biography about the billionaire because it would have made him “explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/elon-musk-denies-selling-starlink-to-russia-after-ukraine-claims-use-in-war
Elon musk,US Election 2024,"Some social media users claim to have found an explanation forVice President Kamala Harris’s2024 election loss. They say billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes to benefit President-elect Donald Trump.

Starlink is an internet provider that uses satellites to provide connectivity; it’s a subsidiary of Musk’s commercial spaceflight company SpaceX.









“Musk’s Starlink uploaded votes in swing states,” one November 10 Threads post said. “Swing state voters went Dem downballot but Trump at the top? Unlikely. Starlink satellites exploding, destroying evidence.”

Starlink made headlines in recent weeks when the company distributed equipment to help people regain internet access in hurricane-hit areas. To some people, that move was furt​​herproof of the conspiracy.

“The Russians have access to Starlink terminals and therefore the satellites. The Russians are known hackers,” said another November 10 Threads post. “Elon Musk and the US gov. sent Starlink terminals to Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia due to the hurricanes.”

Other Threads users summarised the unsubstantiated claims: “People are saying Elon Musk used Starlink to steal the US Election for Donald Trump.”

These posts were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact’spartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)

Election security experts and state and local election officials rebutted the claims, saying the 2024 presidential election was secure and there’s no evidence of Starlink-related fraud.

“Starlink is suspected by conspiracy theorists not because of what it does, but because Elon Musk owns it,” Mike Rothschild, a journalist, author and conspiracy theory expert, said.

This conspiracy theory circulated on Threads amid a larger wave of election denial claims from liberals that mimic Republicans’ false claims about 2020 election fraud.

“Conspiracy theories about lost elections being stolen are a natural way to cope with an unexpected outcome,” Rothschild said, adding that it’s important to “leave conspiracism behind and embrace reality”.

Jen Easterly, director of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, reported on November 6 that the agency had “no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure”.

Officials from swing states that received Starlink technology after the September and October hurricanes also said Starlink technology could not have been used to benefit Trump.

North Carolina’s tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet, Patrick Gannon, the North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesperson, said. State law prohibits connecting such equipment to the internet, he added.

“Satellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,” Gannon said. “In addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. We have no evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone.”

The other six swing states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – have similar election security protocols to ensure voting equipment is never connected to the internet during ballot tabulation.

Even if Starlink had somehow been used to modify the vote count, there are systems designed to catch tabulation discrepancies, including risk-limiting audits, canvassing and certification of the election results, said Michael Specter, a Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professor specialising in election security.

“None of these are foolproof, but each makes it significantly less likely that an attack would be successful,” Specter said.

Broadly speaking, voting machines are not connected to the internet, experts said. In some states, ballot tabulators are briefly connected to the internet to transmit results when polls close. And in many places, other election infrastructure, such as pollbooks with lists of digital voter registration records, has internet connectivity.

We found little evidence Starlink is widely used during elections. Even in Asheville, North Carolina’s Buncombe County, one of the places hardest hit by Hurricane Helene, election officials told PolitiFact that Starlink was not used for any election functions.

Genya Coulter, senior election analyst for the OSET Institute, a nonprofit group focused on accurate, secure and transparent elections, said she knew Starlink technology had been used to support election infrastructure in one place: Tulare County, California. Trump won Tulare County with about 60 percent of the vote.

“Most of the rural part of the county has little to no access to broadband, and Starlink was used to have the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database,” Coulter said. Pollbooks are lists of digital voter registration records.

Vote tabulators weren’t connected to Starlink satellite internet, she said, adding that the county had about 28,000 in-person voters.

Regarding claims about Russian hackers swaying election outcomes, Coulter said she was “less worried about Russian hackers affecting vote totals and significantly more concerned” with the deluge of incorrect election information that Russian-linked groups distributed online before the election and the bomb threats targeting election infrastructure that officials said were “of Russian origin”.

On November 10, a Starlink satellite reentered Earth’s atmosphere heading southeast from Washington to Texas and exploded.

Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and science data system group leader at NASA’s Chandra X-ray Center, said there’s nothing noteworthy about that.

“This is not a case of suddenly deciding to retire this satellite within the past week,” McDowell said. “Such reentries have been happening almost daily for the past few years, they just are at random times and random places in the world so not often over the US at night where Americans can see it.”

According to US Space Force data, SpaceX removed this particular satellite from operation on August 2, at which point the satellite started lowering its orbit, McDowell said. SpaceX abandoned the satellite on October 13, McDowell added.

Stargazers in southwest United States reported seeing fireballs in the early morning hours of November 10. McDowell said that’s normal: During satellite reentry and breakup, observers can sometimes see fireballs moving slowly across the sky.







Some of the posts that floated the Starlink conspiracy theory pointed to Democratic successes in some down-ballot races as evidence that something was off in the Trump-Harris results. Although there’s a strong correlation between votes cast for president and senator, it’s not ironclad. Voters are free to choose candidates from different parties for different offices, and some fraction of voters do.

Ticket-splitting – when voters choose a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another – has become less common in recent election cycles as political polarisation has increased. But the practice hasn’t disappeared entirely.

Incumbency can help candidates win re-election. For instance, two swing states had Democratic incumbents keep their Senate seats: Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada. Their achievements in office and voters’ familiarity might have helped these candidates.

Controversy, or a lack thereof, can also affect candidates’ campaigns. In Arizona, for example, Republican Kari Lake came to voters’ attention in 2022 when she lost a gubernatorial race built heavily on claims that elections are fraudulent, including the 2020 presidential race that Biden won. This year, she lost to Democratic Representative Ruben Gallego, a retired US Marine and a Latino, in a campaign year in which Latino voters were pivotal within the electorate.

Specter, the professor, said split-ticket voting “does not provide sufficient evidence that any malfeasance has occurred”.







Threads posts said Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes in the 2024 election to benefit Trump.

Federal and state election officials rebutted claims of 2024 election fraud, including claims that Starlink manipulated the vote counts.

Voting machines aren’t typically connected to the internet and longstanding systems ensure votes are fairly and accurately tabulated.

We found only one instance – in California, not a swing state – of Starlink technology being used to support election infrastructure, such as having the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database.

We rate these claimsPants on Fire!

Elon musk,US Election 2024,"Since Elon Musk took over Twitter, and changed its name to X, he has banned journalists critical of him, and been accused of censoring Democratic voices while simultaneously amplifying those of far-right extremists, even while claiming to be a “free speech absolutist”.

While BlueSky, Meta’s Threads and others have gained from users disaffected with X, they pale in comparison to X’s hold on the information landscape.

His history of censoring views he doesn’t agree with and his full-throated endorsement of Donald Trump has raised concerns that there will be an information void before the consequential United States Presidential election. After all, 65 percent of the platforms’ users go for news content according to a recent reportfrom Pew Research.

Matt J, who declined to give his full last name, works in the legal profession in South Carolina. Despite running the left-leaning account “Blue Resistors In Red States”, he’s pushed content from far-right-wing provocateurs like Laura Loomer, on his “For You” page practically every day.

“I’m getting pushed information from the fringes of right-wing people who I don’t even follow,” Matt J tells Al Jazeera.

Maryanne Chisholm, a progressive X user, tells Al Jazeera something similar. She continually gets pushed by content from far-right elected officials like Marjorie Taylor Greene who she blocked.

“I go on every day and people I’ve blocked pop back up as people I’m following,” Chisholm told Al Jazeera

On Monday, Elon Musk, who has no background in journalism, spent more than an hour interviewing former President Donald Trump on a myriad of issues. Musk gave Trump free rein to spread his message unfiltered and without a fact-checking apparatus to debunk his lies in real-time.

Throughout the interview, Trump was allowed to make false and misleading claims ranging from tax policy to immigration. Trump repeated the false claim that the vice resident was appointed as Biden’s “border czar”. In 2021, Biden tasked the vice president with addressing the root causes of migration — why people want to leave their nation of origin in the first place —- not border security.

Musk has allowed Trump and his allies to voice their views unchecked. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, even referred to the interview as “unfiltered”.







At the same time, Musk isn’t giving the same freedom to liberal voices who are trying to get their messaging across before the general election.

In recent weeks, amid Kamala Harris’s clinch of the Democratic presidential nomination, Musk has increasingly become more hostile towards her and her campaign. In response to a post from Senator JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, Musk said that thesitting vice president’s“philosophy would cause a de facto holocaust for all of humanity!” LastWednesday, hemade the false claim that “Kamala is quite literally a communist.”

His angst towards Harris is also translating to what consumers see on their respective feeds. Across X, users were unable to follow KamalaHQ, Harris’s campaign page. The issue was so widespread that it caught the attention of congressional leaders. On July 23, New York Representative Jerry Nadler called onthe House Judiciary Committee to investigatewhy this happened and if Musk had any involvement. The House Judiciary Committee is chaired by Jim Jordan who has been a vocal critic of “big tech” political censorship of conservatives.

Nadler and Jordan did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

This is not the first time that Musk has been accused of throttling content from users who he does not see eye to eye with, including news organisations and competing social media platforms.

Musk currently faces a lawsuit from one journalist — former CNN anchorDon Lemonabout X allegedly cancelling a deal with him for a show on the platform which came after the longtime news anchor questioned Musk about the rise in hate speech on X among other hot button topics. Representatives for Lemon declined to comment due to the pending suit.

In December 2022, Musk temporarily banned a handful of left-leaning journalists critical of him and did this again this past January.

Last year in January, Bloomberg reported that Musk also pressured the head of trust and safety to suspend Chad Loder — a left-wing activist who used the platform to identify participants of the January 6 attacks on the US Capitol.

That’s echoed by recent reporting from Wired which cited several former staffers voicing concerns that Musk’s consolidation of power within X has allowed him to push his own increasingly fringe political stances without checks and balances.

In recent years, Musk dissolved the Trust and Safety Council – a group of independent 100 organisations that advised the company on ways to tackle issues like hate speech, and dismantled teams dedicated to addressing misinformation on the platform.







Most recently, the account “White Dudes for Harris” is in the spotlight. After a fundraising call on July 29 that raised roughly $4m from about 200,000 supporters, the account was immediately suspended. Within a day X reinstated the account but it soon had more trouble. On Tuesday, the group behind the account told Al Jazeera they discovered they were once again being censored. This time it’s being labelled as spam.

“I haven’t done anything that is spammy. Like we’re not bulk-following people. We’re not bulk-tweeting people. We’re not, you know, terrorising people. So there’s no reason for us to get in trouble,” Mike Nellis, co-creator of White Dudes For Harris, told Al Jazeera.

Nellis is not an inexperienced campaigner, he is a political comms juggernaut who has worked on digital campaigns for candidates ranging from Kamala Harris and Joe Biden to Representative Adam Schiff and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Musk’s censorship efforts, he said, stoked concerns about raising awareness for left-leaning causes in the run-up to the general election.

“We’ve gotten a lot of DMs [direct messages] from people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump two times, they’re thinking about voting for Kamala Harris this time, and they appreciate that our account exists. We’re reaching real people on this platform. I think it’s wrong of Elon Musk to put his thumb on the scale for his own politics this way,” Nellis said.

That’s echoed by Matt J, who pushes commentary on liberal issues. He said he noticed that fewer people have been seeing his posts.

“I can see on my analytics page that my posts aren’t getting as much traction as they used to,” Matt J told Al Jazeera.

Matt J, who paid for Twitter Blue (now X Premium) — the platform’s paid service which gives users more resources including a feature that allows users to craft lengthier posts —  says despite paying for this service – created by Musk after his takeover – which promises posts will get more exposure, some of his are getting only a couple hundred views despite having more than 21,000 followers. This is drastically down from the tens of thousands of views he used to get.

Chisholm, who has more than 70,000 followers, says she has seen a 78 percent drop in views more recently.

“When I started actively, aggressively supporting Kamala. My views dropped from half a million to five hundred. It was a huge drop,” Chisholm told Al Jazeera.

Chisholm also pays for premium and has access to in-depth analytic reports on her account’s performance.

Chisholm, Matt J and Nellis are concerned that censorship undermines their ability to point people to fundraising opportunities.

“If our account is suspended [or limited] at a time when we’re raising millions of dollars for Kamala Harris and our links come up dead [meaning the links no longer lead to anything], that limits our fundraising. It limits our potential,” Nellis said.

There is a looming fear of what will happen if Musk targets their page once again.

“Tens of thousands of people are flocking to our Twitter page to follow us because they like our content and if our account is no longer there, that limits our ability to reach them,” he added.







Musk has been in hot water for his role in politics off of the platform in recent weeks, as well. America PAC, a political action committee run by Musk, has been accused of falsely claiming to register voters in swing states, as first reported by CNBC. The PAC is now under investigation by election officials in both Michigan and North Carolina.

After the investigation was announced, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Bensonposted that elected officials, includingherself and the state’s attorney general, inexplicably lost their blue checkmarks on X — the icon that indicates official accounts for the office.

Other state attorneys general lost their checkmark, but seemingly only in states like Arizona and Wisconsin – where Republicans had been indicted for their roles in fraudulent elector schemes, including the Trump team’s lies about election interference in the 2020 presidential election.

The America PAC did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

It is not left-wing voices but also causes that are deemed as liberal causes — like trans rights — which X has made efforts to censor. Since Musk took over the company, X removed transgender protections in its hate speech policy. In 2023, Business Insider reported that it limited visibility on tweets sent via DM that included words like “trans”.

But the platform’s decisions are indicative of Musk’s personal stance on trans issues and he has been known to use openly hostile and dehumanising language to describe trans people, including one of his children.

Musk’s moves come despite his accusations that the social media giant’s previous leadership put their thumb on the scale to help liberal causes and censor conservative voices and causes. In 2022, Musk worked with a handful of right-leaning journalists to showcase what he alleged was proof that previous Twitter leadership shadowbanned conservative voices. The Twitter Files was accused of using cherry-picked data to support Musk’s case.

Meanwhile, academic studies of the anti-conservative bias on social media platforms have found that Musk’s allegations were baseless and there was no systematic censoring of conservative voices.

Elon musk,Looks like Elon Musk is done selling Tesla stock for now,"Elon Musk has disposed of enough shares to reach a target of reducing his stake in Tesla Inc. by 10%, the head of the electric-car leader said in an interview.

“I sold stock that should roughly make my total Tesla share sale roughly 10%,” he told satirical website Babylon Bee.









Musk has been offloading Tesla stock since asking his Twitter followers in November whether he should sell some of his stake. The move is part of a plan to generate cash to cover an estimated tax bill of more than $10 billion on stock options Musk is due to exercise.

Late Sunday, he said in a Tweet that he would pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year, hitting back at criticism from a number of lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren who called Musk a “freeloader” on social media. Warren and other leading Democrats are alleging billionaires like Musk are avoiding paying taxes.

“I don’t have any offshore accounts, I don’t have any tax shelters,” Musk said, adding that he could do his taxes himself in just a few hours. “Everything is extremely transparent.”

The latest regulatory filings show Musk has sold yet more shares in Tesla for $528 million, taking the total to around 13.5 million shares for about $14.1 billion. His comments to Babylon Bee suggest he has since disposed of yet more stock.

Tesla has declined by about a quarter since a peak on Nov. 4, just prior to Musk’s Twitter poll, to which the majority of respondents answered “yes.” The shares rose 2.4% in premarket trading after closing at $938.53 in New York on Tuesday.

Musk, 50, is the world’s richest person, atop the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a fortune of $244.9 billion.

“I’m not sure it’s all that productive or interesting” to focus on his wealth, Musk said. “Essentially all of my net worth is just in SpaceX and Tesla stock, these two companies I helped create and have run now almost 20 years that have done a lot of useful things.”

Elon musk,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.

Al Jazeera is an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government.
