Salvador Prison,Can Trump legally deport US citizens to El Salvador prisons?,"After deporting 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members and 23 members of a Salvadoran gang to a maximum-security El Salvador prison last month, US President Donald Trump is now contemplatingdeporting criminals who are United States citizensthere as well, he told reporters on Monday.

But Trump’s latest plan will probably face multiple legal challenges. Forcibly sending American passport holders outside the country is likely illegal, experts say, and Trump himself signed a bill during his first term that could make such deportations even more difficult.

So what is Trump’s plan, what are the legal challenges and can it ever be legal to deport a US citizen from the US?

Last month,Trump deported 238 alleged membersof the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, as well as 23 alleged members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 to El Salvador.

These men are now being held in the Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism (Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo) or CECOT, a 40,000-capacity, maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

To facilitate this, the Trump administration struck a deal under which the US government will pay El Salvador about $6m to detain alleged Tren de Aragua members for a year.

Trump also invoked a wartime “zombie” law from 1798, the Alien Enemies Act, to enable the deportations. This law permits US presidents to detain or deport noncitizens during wartime. Prior to Trump’s use of it, the Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.

Trump’s use of the law is controversial, as critics argue that the US is not currently under any threat of “invasion” as a result of being at war. An explainer article from the Brennan Center for Justice argued in 2024 that invoking the act “in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse” and such an attempt should be struck down by the courts.

Another point of controversy is that, as well as the alleged gang members, Trump also deportedKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran citizen who has lived in Maryland for 14 years and is married to a US citizen.

In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Maryland after an informant told the police that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 terrorist. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have denied this allegation, citing a lack of any proof that Abrego Garcia is affiliated with the MS-13.

Later in 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia an immigration protection called “withholding of removal”, which shielded him from being returned to El Salvador and allowed him to remain in the US.

The government has described his deportation as an “administrative error”, but still claims that Abrego Garcia has ties to MS-13. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele said he would not return Abrego Garcia, who is now being held in CECOT, to the US.

“The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?” Bukele told reporters on Monday.

In an unsigned order on Thursday, however, the US Supreme Courtunanimously ruledin a 9-0 decision that Trump should facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the US. The court currently comprises a conservative majority of 6-3.







Trumphosted El Salvador’s President Bukeleat the White House for bilateral talks on Monday, during which they discussed the recent deportations as well as plans for more – this time of US citizens.

Trump told Bukele during the meeting: “I said homegrowns are next, the homegrowns. You gotta build about five more places.” By “homegrowns”, Trump was referring to criminals who hold US citizenship.

The US president told reporters on Monday after that meeting that he hopes to deport US citizens who are criminals to El Salvador. Bukele said that he would be open to housing US prisoners as well. Trump acknowledged, however, that he would only be able to proceed with this plan if it is shown to be legal, and that he would only deport citizens who are “violent criminals”.

“We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking, that are absolute monsters,” said Trump.

“I’d like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country, but you’ll have to be looking at the laws on that.”

During a media briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump “would only consider this [sending US citizens to El Salvador], if legal, for Americans who are the most violent, egregious, repeat offenders of crime who nobody in this room wants living in their communities”. She did not provide additional comments about the legal considerations the administration would make.

When Fox News host Jesse Watters askedAttorney General, Pam Bondion Tuesday if the plan to deport US citizens was legal, she said only: “These are Americans who he is saying have committed the most heinous crimes in our country, and crime is going to decrease dramatically because he has given us a directive to make America safe again.

“These people need to be locked up as long as they can, as long as the law allows. We’re not going to let them go anywhere, and if we have to build more prisons in our country, we will do it.”

However, immigration law experts say the plan would not be legal. “No, he [Trump] can’t send US citizens to El Salvador,” human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith told Al Jazeera.

Bruce Fein, an American lawyer specialising in constitutional and international law, told Al Jazeera: “It would be unconstitutional to remove US citizens to a foreign country for imprisonment.”

There are a series of legal challenges which could make Trump’s latest idea unfeasible, including:

One legal loophole that the Trump administration could exploit is that, in rare cases, people who are not born in the US but arenaturalisedcan lose their citizenship.

A foreign-born resident of a country can obtain citizenship by naturalisation after spending a certain amount of time in the country and typically proving that they have assimilated into US culture. To become a naturalised US citizen, you must be over the age of 18 and have lived continuously in the US as a green card holder for five years, or three years if you are married to a US citizen.

Naturalised citizens can lose their citizenship or become denaturalised if they commit certain crimes, including terrorism, war crimes, human rights violations, sex crimes or fraud. Denaturalisation can also happen to someone who commits an act of treason against the US, or someone who runs for public office or joins the military of a foreign country.

Fein told Al Jazeera that if a US citizen is imprisoned in a foreign country, scenarios similar to the Abrego Garcia case could play out. “Trump could secretly violate the constitution and then claim he was powerless to return the US citizen to the United States, similar to Abrego Garcia,” he said.

“The foreign imprisonment would be immediately challenged in court and create another collision between Article 2 and Article 3 as we see unfolding with Abrego Garcia,” said Fein. Article 2 of the US constitution grants the US president executive power while Article 3 places the judicial power in the Supreme Court. In the Abrego Garcia case, the Supreme Court has decided that Abrego Garcia should be returned to the US, while the Trump administration does not plan to bring him back.

“The constitution is under stress as never before since the Civil War,” Fein said.

“The problem is how a US court may enforce an order that it is illegal. The courts are always dependent on the good faith of the relevant governments, and in a time of right-wing populism, good faith is sometimes lacking,” said Smith.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/16/can-trump-legally-deport-us-citizens-to-el-salvador-prisons,NEGATIVE,0.996813952922821
Salvador Prison,US deports over 200 Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador despite court ban,"The United States has flown more than 200 immigrants, alleged members of a Venezuelan gang, to be imprisoned in El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele has said, after his US counterpart Donald Trumpcontroversially invokedwartime legislation to expel them.

The deportations on Sunday took place despite a US federal judge granting a temporary suspension of the expulsions order, apparently as planes were already headed to El Salvador.

In a sharp rebuke Sunday, Venezuela’s government said Trump had “criminalized” Venezuelan migrants, whom it said were “in their immense majority… dignified and honest” workers, not terrorists. It added that the action violated both US and international laws.

“Oopsie … Too late,” Bukele posted on social media in response to an article on the judge’s ruling, adding a crying-with-laughter emoji.

The Trump administration said it was appealing the court order.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt defended the deportations, saying Trump was “using his core powers as president and commander-in-chief to defend the American people from an urgent threat”.

Bukele announced the action Sunday on X, saying, “Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country.”

Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country. They were immediately transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center, for a period of one year (renewable).

He shared a video of several men in handcuffs and shackles being transferred from a plane to a heavily guarded convoy, while the presidency shared a series of photos showing prisoners’ heads being shaved, and then hands manacled behind their backs, on their arrival in El Salvador.

Bukele said the US would “pay a very low fee” for El Salvador’s custody of the men, but neither he nor American officials specified the amount.

Trump on Friday signed an order invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, but it was not publicly announced until Saturday.

The contentious wartime authority allows a US president to detain or deport citizens of an enemy nation, and has been invoked only three times before – during major international conflicts, including World War I and II.

Bukele, in a meeting last month with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, offered to house prisoners from the US in his country, including members of Tren de Aragua and Salvador’s own MS-13 gang.

Iron-fisted Bukele is extremely popular in his Latin American country for a successful crackdown on violent gangs, but has faced criticism from human rights groups.

His offer to take in foreign convicts for a fee has divided Salvadorans, who fear it could set back the country’s fight against violent crime.

Leavitt told the Fox News Sunday Morning Futures programme that Trump “is acting within the bounds of the law”.

Bukele said the alleged gang members had been sent to the country’s maximum security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a mega-prison on the edge of a jungle 75km (47 miles) southeast of San Salvador with a capacity for 40,000 prisoners.

Inmates there are packed in windowless cells, sleep on metal beds with no mattresses and are forbidden to have visitors.

Rubio said in a statement on Sunday that as part of the transfer of Venezuela’s migrants, the US had deported “top leaders” of MS-13, “plus 21 of its most-wanted to face justice in their homeland”.

Trump, in his order, claimed Tren de Aragua was “conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime”.

The statement gives Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi 60 days to enact the ruling making all Tren de Aragua gang members “subject to immediate apprehension, detention and removal”.

The order will apply to all Venezuelan Tren de Aragua members who are over 14 and not naturalized US citizens or lawful permanent residents.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and an allied group, Democracy Forward, asked the US District Court in Washington to bar the deportations – arguing that the 1798 act was not intended for use in peacetime.

Judge James Boasberg on Saturday issued a 14-day halt to any deportation under the new order.

Bondi slammed the ruling, saying in a statement that it “puts the public and law enforcement at risk”.

The El Salvador prison where the alleged gang members were sent already houses some 15,000 members of the MS-13 and rival Salvadoran Barrio 18 gangs.

They were rounded up under a state of emergency imposed by Bukele after a surge in gang violence in 2022.

Salvador Prison,The El Salvador diaries: The psychology of mass incarceration,"On May 17, Mauricio Arriaza Chicas, the head of El Salvador’s National Civil Police, took to Twitter to broadcast the news that “more than 31,000 terrorists” had thus far been “captured” since the inception of the nationalstate of emergencyat the end of March.

The state of emergency was occasioned by a surge in homicides following a collapse in negotiations between Salvadoran gangs and members of the administration of President Nayib Bukele, including Carlos Marroquín, the director for the reconstruction of social fabric.









Before the latest “terrorist” roundup, El Salvador already boasted a prison population of about 39,000; as of October 2021, the diminutive country had the fourth-highest per capita imprisonment rate in the world (first place goes to – who else? – the United States). Now, under the ongoing state of emergency, the Bukele regime has spontaneously enacted a “special law” paving the way for the rampant construction of new jails. After all, locking up poor young men is clearly a better way to reconstruct El Salvador’s “social fabric” than, say, offering options for economic survival that would allow folks to refrain from joining gangs in the first place.

As with any good “war on terror”, there has been plenty of collateral damage. Among the 31,000-plus captured “terrorists”, for example, was 21-year-old musician Elvin Josué Sánchez Rivera, who was interned in early April at Izalco prison northwest of the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador. When he died a few weeks later, his family was first told that the cause of death had been coronavirus.

This was subsequently amended to “hypertension” and “sudden death”, and the family’s request for an autopsy was refused in spite of – or because of – bruises and other signs of abuse on Sánchez Rivera’s body. As of May 17, nine inmates had reportedly perished at Izalco prison alone since the state of emergency kicked off in March.

I arrived in El Salvador in mid-April for a one-month stay. Shortly after my arrival, I had the opportunity to speak with a Salvadoran psychologist in his mid-thirties – we’ll call him Julio – who had himself been swept up in Bukele’s mass detention frenzy and had spent six days in a jam-packed cell at San Salvador’s endearingly dubbed “El Penalito”, or “little prison”. As the New York Timesnotes, El Penalito “has become ground zero for perhaps the most aggressive police crackdown in the Central American country’s history”.

When he was admitted, Julio told me one April afternoon over giant beers, his cell contained some 55 other men and boys, which rendered it impossible to move and meant that he spent his first night in prison standing up. The toilet was a hole in the ground, into which water was poured – whenever there happened to be water, that is.

His fellow inmates ranged from tattooed gang members to an 84-year-old deaf man, a 16-year-old boy, and a number of street vendors who had apparently been scooped up from the downtown area and hastily tagged as gang associates – which is certainly one way to deal with surplus people who are interfering with the government’s vision of a “revitalised” city centre that will appeal to theBitcoin investor crowdand other international visitors. It is also a handy trick in terms of fulfilling daily detention quotas imposed on police in accordance with the state of emergency and the need to keep bellicose momentum up.

On account of his fair skin and obvious relative socioeconomic privilege, Julio said, various inmates initially pegged him as a police informant, but the gang member in charge in the cell took a liking to him, and even lent him a pair of shorts to compensate for the jailers’ decision to incarcerate him nude. This gang member also looked out for the 84-year-old and the 16-year-old, oversaw the division of food at mealtimes so that everyone got to eat, and – once some of the men had been transferred out of the cell – devised a sleeping arrangement that entailed having other people’s feet in your face but that at least saved you from having to remain vertical for 24 hours a day.

Julio was first nicknamed “Tarzan”, then “Aquaman”, and finally “El Profe” – “The Teacher” – when he undertook to instruct the others on physical exercises that could be performed within the confines of the cell. His tales of regular surfing excursions on the beaches of El Salvador elicited the interest of his cellmates, many of whom had never seen the sea despite the country’s ample coastline.

Already acutely aware of his privilege, he thus became even more so, and began thinking – he told me – that it would be fine if he died in jail, as he had enjoyed more than his fair share of opportunities on earth. Some of the other men shared tidbits of their own personal histories, which tended thematically towards family members who had been killed or raped. In the end, life is cheap in El Salvador – and it is the poor who pay the price.

Julio attributed his quick release from El Penalito to his “whiteness” – a signifier of social class, as well – and reckoned that, had he not been so “white”, his family would never have heard from him again. Prior to his liberation, he witnessed a perfunctory visit to the prison by representatives of El Salvador’s Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, an institution firmly in the pocket of Bukele – whose own approach to human rights consists of continuously mocking the very concept on Twitter.

Addressing one of the human rights representatives through the bars of the cell, Julio had urged the man to put the abusive conditions in perspective: “How would you feel if your child was in here?” According to Julio, the response was: “That’s why I don’t have children,” followed by some remarks on the unpleasant odor emitted by the jailed population.

Of course, since gang members are relentlessly portrayed as savage and inhuman by nature, it is easier for the Salvadoran government to justify denying them human rights – ditto for 84-year-old men and anyone else who happens to be ensnared in the whole hunt for “terrorists”. The bombastic demonisation of a significant section of Salvadoran society also handily distracts from the inhumanity of neoliberalism itself, which thrives on the perpetuation and imprisonment of misery – just like in the United States, the superpower that has long backed right-wing oppression in El Salvador and that is largely to thank for spawning the gang phenomenon.

And while it should not take a psychologist to realise that gang members are human, too, it is not in the government’s interest to acknowledge that there is a concrete politico-socioeconomic explanation for the existence of gangs – and that they are a byproduct rather than a cause of a fundamentally violent system. Conveniently, another new law that sped through the Salvadoran parliament in April ambiguously criminalises sharing information about gangs, which means that any substantive discussion of Salvadoran reality has been effectively outlawed.

In Julio’s case, his prison stint no doubt offered profound opportunities for auto-psychoanalysis – not to mention psychological evaluation of a deranged regime and its imprisonment-based war on poverty. When I met him for beer, he was still visibly traumatised, fretting about being out after dark and the possibility of encountering police checkpoints on the road.

On May 4, Bukele tweeted imperiously that, in El Salvador, “no type of crime” would be tolerated. But as the state of emergency drags on – dismantling countless lives in the process – it all amounts to one big crime.

Salvador Prison,Trump deports 238 ‘gang members’ to El Salvador: What’s the controversy?,"President Donald Trump’s administration hasdeported alleged membersof the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua from the United States to El Salvador despite a court order prohibiting their expulsion from the country.

Sunday’s move isthe latestin a series of steps by the Trump administration to expel foreign nationals – some accused of being in the US without documentation, others targeted over campus protests.

Here is what happened and whether it violated the court order:

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said on Sunday that his country had received 238 Tren de Aragua members and an additional 23 members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 from the US.

Bukele had agreed to jail members of these groups on behalf of the US in a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month.

He said these deportees were in the custody of the Central American country’s Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT) for a one-year period that could be extended.

During Trump’s inauguration speech, he said he would invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. On Saturday, Trump signed a proclamation invoking that 227-year-old law. The proclamation claims that Tren de Aragua is “perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion” against US territory. It adds that all Venezuelan citizens aged 14 or older “who are members of” the gang and are not naturalised or lawful permanent US citizens are liable to be restrained and removed as “Alien Enemies”.

After Trump’s order, federal Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the District Court for the District of Columbia, issued a temporary restraining order to block Trump’s ability to exercise wartime powers to carry out deportations. This was during a hearing on Saturday sought by the American Civil Liberties Union.

But hours later, Bukele confirmed that the Trump administration had nevertheless gone ahead with the deportations. He shared a snippet of a news article about the judge’s ruling, captioning it: “Oopsie … Too late” with a crying-with-laughter emoji.

TheAlien Enemies Actallows US presidents to detain or deport noncitizens during wartime. In 1798, the US was preparing for what it believed was a war with France. The law was introduced to prevent immigrants from sympathising with the French.

The law allows the president to carry out these deportations without a hearing and based only on citizenship.

The act has been invoked only three times before, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.

While Trump and his allies have argued that the US is at threat of “invasion” by undocumented immigrants, critics said the president is wrongly invoking the wartime law.

An explainer published by theBrennan Center for Justicelast year said invoking the act “in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse”.

“The courts should strike down any attempted peacetime use of the Alien Enemies Act,” it added.

TheFifth Amendmentof the US Constitution protects the right to a grand jury. “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,” it states, adding that wartime is one of the few exceptions to this.

The fact that the Trump administration possibly defied a judge’s order further exacerbates this controversy.

The White House’s action was in “open defiance” of Boasberg’s order, Patrick Eddington, a homeland security and civil liberties legal expert at the Washington, DC-based Cato Institute, told the Reuters news agency.

“This is beyond the pale and certainly unprecedented,” Eddington said.

But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has pushed back against the criticism.

“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft … full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil,” Leavitt said in a statement posted on her X account on Sunday. She added: “Federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the President’s conduct of foreign affairs.”

Bruce Fein, an American lawyer specialising in constitutional and international law, disagreed.

“The president is not a king. January 20, 2025, was not a coronation,” Fein told Al Jazeera, referring to the day Trump was inaugurated. “The president is not Napoleon. … Federal courts have jurisdiction over the president. The probability that Trump flouted Judge James Boasberg’s order is high, but we need to await more due process.”

The Administration did not ‘refuse to comply’ with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory. The written order and the Administration’s actions do not conflict. Moreover, as the Supreme…https://t.co/DnjUsuWTLH

Leavitt argued that by the time the court order was issued, the deportees had been removed from the US. The exact timings of the deportation flight are unclear.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University’s Law Center, posted on Bluesky that “a federal court’s jurisdiction does *not* stop at the water’s edge.” In other words, according to Vladeck, those deportees ought to be brought back to the US even if they had left the US airspace by the time the judge issued his order.

“The court’s jurisdiction turns on the presence of the defendant in the United States, not the plaintiffs,” Fein explained, adding that Trump, the defendant in this case, is in the US. “He could be ordered to return deportees who had been illegally deported to the United States.”

Bukele is detaining the deportees under a deal in which the US agreed to compensate El Salvador to hold them, Bukele wrote in an X post. The Trump administration will pay about $6m to El Salvador for detaining about 300 alleged Tren de Aragua members from Venezuela for a year.

The Salvadorian president also shared a video on his X account showing handcuffed deportees being dragged and having their heads and faces shaved by masked El Salvador police officers.

“The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us.”

Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country. They were immediately transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center, for a period of one year (renewable).

Venezuela has typically not accepted deportees from the US. The Trump administration has sent Venezuelan deportees to third countries in Central America “because the US does not have decent relations with Venezuela”, Clive Stafford Smith, a human rights lawyer, toldAl Jazeera.

Over the past month, Venezuela has accepted about 350 deportees, including about 180 detained at the US naval base inGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, for 16 days. As of 2022, there were 275,000 unauthorised Venezuelan immigrants in the US, according to estimates by the Pew Research Center.

The Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism (Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo) is a 40,000-capacity, maximum-security prison in El Salvador. That is where the alleged gang members deported by the US are now being held.

The mega-prison prohibits visitations, education and recreation. Inmates are not allowed to go outdoors.

CECOT opened in January 2023, within a year of Bukele ordering its construction. It is located in Tecoluca, 72km (45 miles) east of the Salvadorian capital, San Salvador.

Tren de Aragua, which is Spanish for the “train of Aragua”, is designated as a “foreign terrorist organisation” by the US.

While information about the group is sparse, media reports have previously suggested that the group was formed in 2014 by Hector “El Nino” Guerrero and two other men who were imprisoned in Tocoron prison in the Venezuelan state of Aragua. The gang largely controlled the prison, allegedly ordering robberies, murders and kidnappings from behind bars.

The gang is alleged to be behind the 2024 murder of former Venezuelan army officer Ronald Ojeda, who conspired against President Nicolas Maduro. In January, Maduro wassworn infor his third six-year term after a contested election.

A proclamation published by the White House alleged that Tren de Aragua “operates in conjunction with Cartel de los Soles, the Nicolas Maduro regime-sponsored, narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela”.

On Sunday, Trump asked the Washington, DC, Circuit Court for a stay of Boasberg’s order. “The stay will assuredly be denied within days,” Fein predicted.

Fein added that Trump could then seek a stay in the US Supreme Court, “which will say no”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/17/trump-deports-238-gang-members-to-el-salvador-whats-the-controversy,NEGATIVE,0.9874241948127747
Salvador Prison,El Salvador’s Bukele suggests prisoner swap for Venezuelans deported by US,"El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner swap that would see Venezuelans deported from the United States to his country exchanged for “political prisoners” in Venezuela.

In pointed remarks directed at Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday, Bukele suggested the countries reach a “humanitarian agreement” amid Caracas’s demands for the repatriation of Venezuelan deportees.

Bukele said he would be willing to repatriate 252 Venezuelans being held in a Salvadoran maximum security prison in exchange for “an identical number of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold”.

“Unlike our detainees, many of whom have committed murder, others have committed rape, and some have even been arrested multiple times before being deported, your political prisoners have committed no crime. The only reason they are imprisoned is because they opposed you and your electoral fraud,” Bukele said on X.

Bukele went on to list a number of people being held in Venezuelan prisons, including Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of exiled former Venezuelan presidential candidate Edmundo González, and Corina Parisca, the mother of opposition leader María Corina Machado.

Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab described Bukele’s proposal as “cynical” and called on his government to provide a complete list of the “hostages” along with “proof of life and a medical report” for each detainee.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has paid about $6m to Bukele’s government to detain accused Venezuelan gang members in El Salvador’s maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center.

The Trump administration hasdeported at least 261 migrantsaccused of belonging to Tren de Aragua and other gangs by controversially invoking the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law that grants the president authority to detain or deport citizens of enemy nations.

US officials have released little evidence to support their claims that the deportees are members of criminal gangs, and media reports based on publicly available information have indicated that only a small minority have criminal records.

Maduro has accused Bukele of being an accomplice to “kidnapping” and called for the deportees to be repatriated to Venezuela.

On Saturday, the US Supreme Court ordered a temporary halt to the deportations of migrants being held in Texas “until further order of this court”.

The 7-2 ruling came after the American Civil Liberties Union filed an emergency petition asking the court to stop the Trump administration from proceeding with what it said were imminent plans to restart deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.

The Supreme Courtruled earlier this monththat the Trump administration could not continue the deportations without giving migrants a chance to challenge their removal in court.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/21/el-salvadors-bukele-suggests-prisoner-swap-for-venezuelans-deported-by-us,NEGATIVE,0.9421255588531494
Salvador Prison,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia ‘alive, secure’ in El Salvador: Trump administration","The Trump administration has acknowledged before a federal court that an immigrant, who wasmistakenlydeported last month, remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador, but refused to say what steps it is taking to return him to the United States.

In a court filing on Saturday, the US State Department saidKilmar Abrego Garciais “alive and secure” in prison, and that he is under the authority of El Salvador’s government.

Abrego Garcia, 29, had lived in the eastern state of Maryland for 14 years, until he wassent to El Salvadoralong with more than 200 other people last month, as part of President Donald Trump’s widespread crackdown on undocumented migrants.

On April 10, the Supreme Court issued an order demanding the Trump administration return Abrego Garcia to the US.

The latest State Department filing comes a day after a government lawyer struggled in a hearing to provide District Judge Paula Xinis with any information about Abrego Garcia’s whereabouts.

The judge issued an order on Friday requiring the administration to disclose Abrego Garcia’s “current physical location and custodial status” and “what steps, if any, Defendants have taken [and] will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.

Michael G Kozak, who identified himself in the filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said in the latest filing that Abrego Garcia “is alive and secure” in the facility in El Salvador.

“He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.”

But the government’s lack of information left Xinis exasperated. “Where is he and under whose authority?” the judge asked during Friday’s hearing.







“I’m not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he’s not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”

The judge repeatedly asked a government lawyer about what had been done to return Abrego Garcia, asking pointedly: “Have they done anything?”

Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general, also told Xinis that he had no knowledge about any actions or plans to return Abrego Garcia.

Ensign told the judge the government was “actively considering what could be done” and said Abrego Garcia’s case involved three cabinet agencies and significant coordination.

During his time in the US, Abrego Garcia worked in construction, got married and was raising three children with disabilities, according to court records.

If he is returned, he will get to face the allegations that prompted his expulsion: a 2019 accusation from local police in Maryland that he was an MS-13 gang member.

Abrego Garcia had denied the allegation and was never charged with a crime, his lawyers said.

The controversy comes as Trump is due to meet El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday.

Asked on Friday if Trump would seek the return of Abrego Garcia when he meets Bukele, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the Supreme Court ruling made clear the administration’s responsibility was to “facilitate” Garcia’s return, “not to effectuate the return”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/13/trump-admin-says-wrongly-deported-man-is-alive-and-secure-in-el-salvador,NEGATIVE,0.9236915111541748
Salvador Prison,El Salvador prison riots kill 21,"Alberto Uribe, a spokesman for the country’s prison system, said: “We found destroyed walls, knives, home-made weapons and disfigured bodies.”



Relatives of inmates gathered outside the prison, hoping for information on what was happening inside.



Roberto Villanova, prisons director, said the jail will be under a state of emergency for 15 days and that more prisoners will be transferred to try to avoid another uprising.



‘Massacre’



Built to hold 1,800 inmates, the facility houses more than 3,000, many considered to be the most dangerous in the country.



Beatrice de Carrillo, government human rights prosecutor, criticised authorities for mixing gang members and common prisoners.



“These deaths are another sign that the penitentiary system doesn’t work,” she said. “This is one of the ugliest massacres that we have seen in recent times.”



Central American jails have long struggled with overcrowding and deadly riots that are often sparked by fights between gangs.



Overcrowding is fuelled in part by a regional gang crackdown that has filled prisons with rival groups.



Last month, a protest at a Mexican prison left at least two people dead.



Flood of violence



Brazil’s prisons also experienced a wave of violence, during which police and guards put down at least seven rebellions in which one inmate was killed.



In Guatemala, a gang was blamed for initiating riots that left 35 inmates dead in 2005.



In El Salvador, 31 inmates were killed in 2004 during a battle between gang and non-gang prisoners.

Salvador Prison,‘Unwaveringly loyal’: Why El Salvador’s Bukele is poised for re-election,"San Salvador, El Salvador –He suspended civil liberties. Led a mass incarceration effort. And provoked international criticism forhuman rights violations.

But five years after he was first elected, President Nayib Bukele appears on track to secure asecond termin office when El Salvador holds its general elections on Sunday.

An estimated69.9 percentof voters approve of his re-election bid, despite questions about itsconstitutionality: Before Bukele, presidents in El Salvador had historically been limited to one term.

Bukele himself has embraced the condemnation he faces, labelling himself “the world’s coolest dictator”.

“On the surface, his base appears unwaveringly loyal to him even if he implements policies that negatively impact a large number of people,” said Rafael Paz Narvaez, a professor from the University of El Salvador.

Still, despite Bukele’s solid base of support, some observers question how long voters will back hisstrongman approach, particularly as more and more people feel its sting.

Under Bukele, El Salvador has one of thehighest incarceration ratesin the world, with an estimated 2 percent of its adult population behind bars.

The country once had one of the highest homicide rates too: In 2015, there were 105 murders for every 100,000 residents, a towering sum.

But Bukele hascreditedhis “mano dura” or “iron fist” tactics for causing that number to tumble to just 7.8 homicides out of every 100,000 people — the lowest in Central America.

That argument has proven compelling for many Salvadorans, who have struggled with decades of widespreadgang violence.

Douglas Guzmán, 35, counts himself among Bukele’s ardent supporters. Wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the slogan “Bukele 2024-2029”, he recently joined dozens of people to watch the daily performance of street dancers in the Libertad Plaza, part of downtown San Salvador.

“This square used to be deserted because of how dangerous it used to be, but now thousands of people come to enjoy life,” Guzmán told Al Jazeera.

Gúzman arrived at the plaza with a selfie stick: He is part of an online community of content creators who use social media platforms like TikTok to preach their support for Bukele.

When asked about the accusations ofhuman rights abusesunder Bukele, Gúzman was quick to dismiss the reports.

“It doesn’t matter if they want to write negative things about the president,” he said of Bukele’s critics, among them non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

“I’ve walked through the dangerous communities, and until those NGOs walk through those streets, they won’t understand that this isn’t what they’re calling human rights violations.”

He emphasised that life had improved since Bukele took office in 2019. “The government is finally valuing human life. Bukele is saving the lives of Salvadorans.”

Bukele’sascent to the presidencymarked a shift in Salvadoran politics. Only 37 years old at the time of his first presidential campaign, Bukele positioned himself as a political outsider, opposed by major parties on the right and left.

His inauguration five years ago made him the youngest president in Latin America, and he proceeded to make good on his ambitions of shaking up the status quo.

Some of his policies were aimed at shoring up El Salvador’s struggling economy: Under Bukele, for instance, the country started to accept thecryptocurrencyBitcoinas legal tender.

But his signature issue has been hiscrackdown on crime. In 2022, Bukele declared anongoing state of emergencyto stamp outgang violence.

The designation curtailed certain rights — including the rights to due process and public gatherings — and expanded the government’s authority to surveil, arrest and prosecute suspected gang members.

An estimated 75,163 people have been arrested since then, according to government figures. Bukele’s administration also opened last year a newmega-prison, designed to house 40,000 people.

In addition to the state of emergency, El Salvador’s legislative assembly — controlled by Bukele’s New Ideas party — approved a series of judicial reforms last July that gave prosecutors the ability to conductmass trials.

Under the reforms, up to 900 people could be tried at once, limiting their ability to prove their innocence. That tough-on-crime approach has formed the centrepiece for Bukele’s re-election campaign, as well as those of his fellow party members.

To maintain his party’s hold over the legislature, Bukele has narrated radio advertisements, warning: “If we lose one Congress member, the opposition will let all gang members free.”

Other party officials have echoed similar themes, playing on fears that the country could return to the high rates of crime it saw before.

For instance, Christian Guevara, the head of the New Ideas caucus in Congress,postedon social media, “The opposition has already said it would open the prison doors and let [suspected criminals] free.”

Narvaez, however, said that Bukele’s popularity is buoyed in part by a strong government communicationsstrategy, one that has heavily invested state-run news sources and social media.

Bukele himself is renowned for his media savvy: On the social media platform X alone, he has more than 5.8 million followers.

“The Salvadoran people are grateful to not have to pay extortion any more. They’re grateful to be able to roam around the city with peace, but this is a feeling that has been constructed through the usage of public funds for Bukele’s propaganda machine,” Narvaez explained.

“As long as undemocratic actions can be justified as bolstering Bukele’s carefully crafted image, they will continue to be applied, not only with no significant backlash from the other state powers but with their compliance.”

While Bukele’s government maintains his “mano dura” measures are necessary to confront high rates of gang violence,critics arguethe powers granted to the police and military have opened the door tocivil liberty violations.

As of January, the organisation Humanitarian Legal Aid has filed more than 1,700 habeas corpus petitions to El Salvador’s Supreme Court on behalf of people who have allegedly been wrongfully detained.

Some of therelatives of those unjustly imprisonedhave formed the Movement of Victims of the State of Emergency (MOVIR). Together, they advocate for accountability and legal redress for the human rights violations perpetrated under the state of emergency.

Santos Arevalo, a 53-year-old agricultural worker and member of MOVIR, used to be an avid supporter of Bukele. He was one of the 1.4 million Salvadorans who voted him into office in 2019. And at first, he was optimistic about the change in leadership.

“Politicians were working only for the people in power,” Arevalo said of previous administrations. “We wanted to give him [Bukele] a shot because he said he was different.”

But then, Arevalo’s son was accused of being a gang member and arrested. So far, he has spent more than nine months awaiting trial in jail, where he is allowed no access to the outside world.

Arevalo has therefore been unable to ascertain his son’s wellbeing. The experience has left him feeling betrayed by the Bukele administration.

“Now he has turned against us for no reason,” Arevalo said of Bukele. “The president was supposed to go after all the gang members. That’s what he promised, but he went off the rails and now is going after innocent families.”

Arevalo only makes the minimum wage: about $243 dollars a month. Nevertheless, he spends $100 each month to deliver a food package to the penitentiary where his son is imprisoned, three hours from his home in the eastern department of Ahuachapán.

Since he is unable to reach his son, Arevalo never knows if the care packages reach him.

“This isn’t a war against gangs. This is a war against poor people,” Arevalo said. He hopes to have his son set free, although he fears his child could face a mass trial, where he would be lumped in with gang members.

For experts like Narvaez, a Bukele victory in Sunday’s election would signal a continuedbackslideaway from democracy.

“If President Bukele scores a re-election, it will solidify his concentration of power and pave the way for further erosion of the rule of law,” he said.

But for Arevalo, the upcoming vote is personal. He plans to stand up against Bukele’s state of emergency for as long as it takes.

“The government has this idea of whipping human rights from this country,” he said. “We know that we and our families have rights, and we are going to continue fighting for them.”

Salvador Prison,US senator meets wrongly deported migrant Abrego Garcia in El Salvador,"A member of the United States Senate has returned from a trip to El Salvador, where he sought the return of a wrongfully deported man in a case that has prompted outrage over President Donald Trump’s “mass deportation” policy.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was living in the eastern state of Maryland until he became one of more than 200 people flown to a prison in El Salvador in last month.

The Trump administration has alleged, without evidence, that the deportees were suspected members of Venezuelan gangTren de Aragua, which the US has declared a “foreign terrorist organisation”.

But the overwhelming majority of them have no criminal record. No hearings were held prior to their deportation and imprisonment, either.

Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, pointed to this fact during a press conference on Friday. He accused the Trump administration of having “illegally abducted” Abrego Garcia.

“ If you deny the constitutional rights of one man, you threaten the constitutional rights and due process for everyone else,” the senator said, speaking from the Washington Dulles International Airport.







Van Hollen represents Maryland, the state Abrego Garcia lived in with his wife and child — both US citizens — before his deportation.

Born in San Salvador, he crossed into the US without legal documentation as a teenager, after he said he fled gang recruitment in his home country.

After marrying his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, in 2019, he applied for legal status to remain in the US. A judge ultimately granted him a protection order that barred him from being deported, ruling that his life could be in jeopardy as a result of the gangs if he returned to El Salvador.

But on March 12 of this year, Abrego Garcia was arrested and taken into custody. By March 15, he was on one of several planes that the Trump administration flew to El Salvador, citing a rarely used wartime law — the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — to justify the deportations.

There, he and his fellow deportees were imprisoned in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT), a maximum-security facility built in 2022 to house as many as 40,000 people. It was constructed as part of the country’s gang crackdown, which has spurred questions of human rights abuses.

In late March, however, an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) admitted Abrego Garcia’s removal to El Salvador was the result of an “administrative error”.

“This removal was an error,” a top ICE official wrote in court documents.

Senator Van Hollen has one of the most prominent figures pushing for Abrego Garcia’s release.

His family had sued the US government, and in early April, US District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia no later than April 7.

The Trump administration appealed, and the case reached the Supreme Court.

In an unsigned decision, the highest court in the US was unequivocal: The Trump administration had to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador. The case then returned to Xinis’s court.

But Xinis has expressed frustration with the lack of action to comply. She has ordered government officials to give sworn testimony about any efforts they have taken to free Abrego Garcia.

On Thursday, a US Appeals Court said it “should be shocking” that the US government is claiming it cannot do anything to free Garcia, after Washington resisted a Supreme Court order to bring him back to the US.

“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” the court said.

Van Hollen cited those words on Friday, as he relayed his frustrations with trying to find Abrego Garcia while in El Salvador.

On April 16, Van Hollenflew to San Salvador, where he hoped to petition the country’s leaders for Abrego Garcia’s release.

“I had two main goals,” the senator said on Friday. “One was to urge the government of El Salvador not to be complicit in the illegal abduction and detention of Mr Abrego Garcia and to release him. I made that request directly to the vice president of El Salvador.”

But Van Hollen added that ensuring Abrego Garcia’s immediate health and wellbeing was a top priority.

“ My principal mission was to meet with Gilmar Abrego Garcia. I told his wife Jennifer and his family that I would do everything in my power to make that happen,” he said.

But the Democrat explained that he was stonewalled in his attempts to even speak to the deported man at first.

“Getting a meeting with Kilmar was not easy. On Wednesday, I met with the vice president of El Salvador and asked if I could meet with them. The answer was no. I asked, if I returned the following week, whether I could meet with them. The answer was no. I asked if I could call him on the phone. The answer was no,” he said.

Van Hollen said he even tried driving to the CECOT prison where Abrego Garcia was last known to be held. Three kilometres from the facility, Van Hollen said his vehicle was stopped and soldiers blocked his path, even while letting other traffic pass.

It was only when he was preparing to leave the country that Van Hollen said he got word Abrego Garcia would be brought to his hotel.

“He said he was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cell, but that he was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways,” Van Hollen said of their conversation.

Eight or nine days ago, Van Hollen added, Abrego Garcia had been moved from CECOT to a facility in Santa Ana.

“ Despite the better conditions, he still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world. His conversation with me was the first communication he’d had with anybody outside a prison since he was abducted,” Van Hollen said.

But the Trump administration has remained defiant, criticising Van Hollen for his trip and repeatedly describing Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member — an unproven allegation.

“Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention from the Fake News Media, or anyone. GRANDSTANDER!!!” Trump wrote on social media on Friday.

Later, at a ceremony in the Oval Office, Trump called Abrego Garcia a “terrorist” and cited a temporary protective order his wife had taken out in the past. She has since said she and Abrego Garcia have resolved their issues and that she had “acted out of caution after a disagreement”.

On social media, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele — who is a close ally of Trump’s — likewise mocked the meeting between Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia as a question of two men “sipping margaritas” in a “tropical paradise”.

“Now that he’s been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody,” hewrote.

But Van Hollen responded to Trump’s allegations at his news conference on Friday, saying that the White House had an obligation to respect judicial authority and the constitutional right to a fair hearing.

“I say to the president, to the Trump administration, if you want to make claims about Mr Abrego Garcia and MS-13, you should present them in the court, not over social media,” he said. “Not at press conferences where you just rattle stuff off.”

Salvador Prison,El Salvador offers to jail US convicts in ‘unprecedented’ proposal,"El Salvador’s president has proposed jailing convicts from the United States in his country, an “unprecedented” offer praised by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Nayib Bukele made the offer while hosting Rubio at his Lake Coatepeque residence, outside San Salvador, on Monday.

Bukele said El Salvador is ready to imprison the convicted Americans for payment in a prison he opened a year ago that is the largest in Latin America.

“We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,” Bukele wrote on X. “The fee would be relatively low for the US but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.”

We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.

We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee.

The fee would be relatively low for…pic.twitter.com/HTNwtp35Aq

— Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele)February 4, 2025



Following the three-hour meeting, Rubio told reporters that Bukele “agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world”.

“He has offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those with US citizenship and legal residency. No country’s ever made an offer of friendship such as this. We are profoundly grateful.”

The US State Department describes El Salvador’s overcrowded prisons as “harsh and dangerous”. The department’s website, in the information on El Salvador, says “in many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control, and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent”.

Rubio added that Bukele was also willing to take back Salvadoran citizens as well as foreign nationals. He appeared to suggest the focus in El Salvador would be on jailing members of Latin American gangs, such as El Salvador’s MS-13 and Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua.

“Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal – MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be — he has offered his jails,” Rubio said.

Since his return to the White House last month, Trump has put priority on speeding up deportation of millions of people in the US who are without legal status.

Trump has also unveiled plans to detain 30,000 migrants at the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba – a prison that previous Democratic presidents hoped to close.

Bukele, who has launched an unflinching security crackdown in his country, is seen by the Trump administration as a key ally in its migration efforts.

Since taking power in 2019, Bukele’s government has arrested more than 80,000 people, bringing the number of homicides down sharply in what was once one of the world’s most violent countries.

While Bukele’s actions havefaced criticism from human rights groups, which have documented mass torture and abuse in the country’s overcrowded jails, heswept back to power last yearwith the public grateful for the plunging crime.

Salvador Prison,Trump eyes deportation of ‘homegrown criminals’ to El Salvador,"The United States hopes to start deporting criminals that hold US passports to El Salvador, President Donald Trump has said.

Trump told reporters as he welcomedEl Salvador’s President Nayib Bukeleto the White House on Monday that he would like to send violent “homegrown criminals” to be imprisoned under a deal with the Central American country’s government.

The comments came amid ongoing controversy over thewrongful deportationof a migrant to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison.

Trump said he would only go through with the idea if his administration decided it was legal.

“We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking, that are absolute monsters,” Trump declared.

“I’d like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country, but you’ll have to be looking at the laws on that.”







Trump told reporters last week that he “loved” the idea, after Bukele said his country was open to housing US prisoners.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later confirmed that the proposal was on the table, saying Trump had “simply floated” the idea.

University of Notre Dame professor Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert, said there is “no provision” under US law “that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country”.

The US leader made the remarks as the controversy over the deportation ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran who was living in Maryland with his family and was granted protection from deportation by a court in 2019 before being shipped to CECOT.

The US Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. However, the administration has said Garcia’s fate is up to El Salvador and has sought to maintain that he is a member of the MS-13 criminal gang, despite a lack of evidence or any convictions.

On Monday, Bukele told Trump that he would neither returnAbrego Garcianor release him in El Salvador. Trump said he was not interested in asking for Abrego Garcia to be released.

Salvador Prison,Trump to meet Bukele as US deports more immigrants to El Salvador,"US President Donald Trump will host El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday, as he seeks to deport more immigrants to a notorious maximum-security prison in the Central American country.

The contentious deportation programme, which has faced several legal challenges, involves the US transferring alleged gang members to El Salvador, including Venezuelans accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua group.









Trump has praised Bukele’s government for accepting individuals the US labels as threats. “President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation’s custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World… They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

On Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said 10 more alleged members of MS-13 and Tren de Aragua had been flown to El Salvador.

“Last night, another 10 criminals from the MS-13 and Tren de Aragua Foreign Terrorist Organizations arrived in El Salvador,” Rubio said on X.

He praised the Trump-Bukele alliance as an example of effective hemispheric cooperation.

The Trump administration has relied on the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify these deportations. Hundreds have been transferred under this rarely used legislation, which allows the removal of nationals from countries deemed hostile during times of conflict.

The administration claims all those deported were vetted and linked to gangs that the US considers “terrorist” organisations.

But lawyers and family members of the detainees dispute these claims, saying many had no opportunity to challenge the accusations in court. Civil rights advocates argue that branding immigrants as gang members without judicial oversight violates due process.

The US Supreme Court has ruled that detainees must receive proper notice to contest deportation orders. However, the decision left open the question of what legal recourse remains for those already sent to El Salvador.

In one high-profile case, the Trump administration confirmed to a federal judge on Saturday that a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported last month, remains confined in an El Salvador prison.

But the government’s filing did not address the judge’s demands that the administration detail what steps it was taking to return Abrego Garcia to the US, only that he is under the authority of the El Salvador government.

The US Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Trump administration must bring him back.

Salvador Prison,"Children ‘tortured, abused’ in El Salvador’s prisons: Report","Thousands of children have been arrested in a mass antigang campaign in El Salvador since 2022 with many suffering abuse while in custody, said Human Rights Watch (HRW).

The arrest campaign, beginning in March 2022 as part of El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s pledge to root out gangs from the once crime-ridden country, has created “severe human rights violations against children”, said the group in a new report on Tuesday documenting the abuses.

Police rounded up 3,319 minors in “countless indiscriminate raids” often targeting those in “low-income neighbourhoods” known to be hotbeds of crime, said the HRWreport.

Many of those arrested have “no apparent connection to gangs’ abusive activity”, and were apparently targeted based on their physical appearance or socioeconomic background, it said.

At least 60 children suffered abuse in custody, the report alleged, including beatings and torture. Some were deprived of adequate food, healthcare, and contact with their families or coerced into making false confessions.







Others were left to be preyed on by adult detainees, with authorities taking few steps to stop beatings or sexual assault, according to the report.

“Many children have been doubly victimised by gang members who abused them and then by security forces who detained and mistreated them with possible lifelong consequences,” said HRW.

Their prison sentences, doled out with dubious evidence and lack of due process, can span up to 12 years for broadly defined crimes, it added.

El Salvador’s gang crackdown, under a state-declared state of emergency, has nearly wiped out its once soaring homicide rate, putting more than 80,000 alleged gangsters behind bars.

Today, El Salvador ranks among the safest countries in the Americas, earning President Bukele strong popular support in spite of his draconian tactics.







Bukele, who was re-elected in February with 85 percent of the vote, has threatened to use the same ironfisted approach against alleged price gougers, warning them to drop their prices or face the same fate as convicted gang members.

“I am going to issue a call, like we did to the gangs at the start of 2019,” Bukele said in a speech earlier this month. “We told them either stop killing people or don’t complain about what happens afterward.”

HRW’s Americas director, Juanita Goebertus, said El Salvador’s government should cease abusive practices in its anticrime campaign.

“The government should end its abusive approach and prioritise a rights-respecting and effective policy that dismantles criminal gangs, addresses child recruitment, and provides children with protection and opportunities,” said Goebertus.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/16/children-tortured-abused-in-el-salvadors-prisons-report,NEGATIVE,0.9764535427093506
Salvador Prison,El Salvador inmates crammed together in prison lockdown,"Defying social distancing recommendations due to the coronavirus, authorities in El Salvador crammed prisoners – albeit some wearing maks – tightly together in prison yards while searching their cells over the weekend.

President Nayib Bukele ordered the crackdown after more than 20 people were murdered in the country Friday and intelligence suggested the orders came from imprisoned gang leaders.

The lockdown came amid fears over the spread of the novel coronavirus in Latin America’s notoriously overcrowded, unruly prisons, threatening to turn them into an inferno.

The Puente Alto prison in downtown Santiago, Chile, had the largest of Latin America’s prison virus outbreaks so far, with more than 300 reported cases. The prison’s 1,100 inmates are terrified. Social distancing is hard to practice in jail.

“They are all in contact with each other,” said prison nurse Ximena Graniffo.

Latin America’s prisons hold 1.5 million inmates, and the facilities are often quasi-ruled by prisoners themselves because of corruption, intimidation and inadequate guard staffs. Low budgets also create ideal conditions for the virus to spread: There is often little soap and water, and cell blocks are crowded.

So far, national officials have reported close to 1,400 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among inmates and prison staff. The worst hit has been Peru, with 613 cases and at least 13 deaths, though the extent of testing to determine the full scale of infections differs from country to country. When the Dominican Republic tested more than 5,500 inmates at the La Victoria prison, which has been producing protective face masks for the public, officials reported at least 239 tested positive.

Perhaps the most complete testing appears to be taking place in Puerto Rico, where the Department of Corrections said Friday it will test all the nearly 9,000 inmates being held across the United States territory, as well as 6,000 employees, including prison guards.

Fear of the virus has itself already proven deadly. There have been 23 deaths in prison riots in Colombia since the pandemic started. More than 1,300 inmates have escaped prisons in Brazil after a temporary release programme was cancelled due to the outbreak, and more than 1,000 have been on hunger strikes in Argentina.

All over the region, the demands are the same: protection against contagion. With most family visits cancelled, inmates feel exposed, vulnerable, alone – and exploited.

Inmates report that prices at informal and formal prison stores have increased during the pandemic, and relatives can no longer bring them food and hygiene items from the outside.

“Right now, a bag of soap powder costs 29 pesos [$1.20], when before it was 20 [80 cents]” said a prisoner in Mexico, who lives in a four metre by four metre (12 foot by 12 foot) cell with a dozen others. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was using a banned mobile phone.

Human Rights Watch says conditions are even worse in countries like Haiti, Bolivia or Guatemala.

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, the former president of Chile, has called sanitary conditions in the region “deplorable” and called for the release of less dangerous inmates.

Countries like Chile and Colombia have already released about 7,500 inmates, and Mexico’s senate last week approved a measure to free thousands, though Brazil has not yet acted.

Regional security analyst Lucia Dammert says releasing a few thousand inmates will not significantly reduce the threat of contagion, however, and some urge more sweeping releases.

“Prisoners have been sentenced to loss of liberty, not to death, and the state has to take measures at its disposal,” said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director for Human Rights Watch. And in many countries, such as Bolivia, most of those behind bars have not yet been sentenced or are awaiting trial.

In Chile, the head of the prison guard system, Christian Alveal, said the prisoners’ fears “are totally reasonable,” and he said officials are working “to minimise the worries of the inmates.”

Some prisons have tried to do that by allowing prisoners more calls to relatives, and Argentina, with 13,000 prisoners, has allowed video calls. Buenos Aires has even allowed prisoners to use mobile phones, which are normally banned because they are sometimes used in extortion schemes.

Inmates at the San Pedro prison in Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, have taken their own measures against contagion. While inmates elsewhere have rioted over bans on family visits, the Bolivian inmates themselves decided on such a ban.

Salvador Prison,US Supreme Court orders return of migrant wrongly deported to El Salvador,"The US Supreme Court has ordered the government to “facilitate” the return of awrongly deported Salvadoran man, in a decision seen as a small victory against President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was living in the eastern state of Maryland until he became one of more than 200 people sent to a prison in El Salvador last month as part of Trump’s crackdown on undocumented migrants.

Most of the deportees were suspected members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has declared a “foreign terrorist organisation”.

But Justice Department lawyers later admitted that Garcia, who is married to a United States citizen, was deported due to an “administrative error”.

In a decision issued on Thursday, the conservative-majority Supreme Court ordered the government to “‘facilitate” Garcia’s release from custody in an El Salvador prison “and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, hailed the court’s ruling, saying “the rule of law prevailed”.

Garciahad been living in the US under protected legal status since 2019 when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

Following his deportation and internment in the notorious CECOT counterterrorist prison, lower courts had ordered that the US government return him to the US by midnight on Monday.

The Supreme Court put that order on hold hours before the deadline, after the administration requested an emergency ruling.







In its challenge, the government argued that Garcia is a member of Salvadoran gang MS-13, a claim the lower courts found lacked evidence.

The US government also argued that it no longer had jurisdiction to have Garcia released now that he is on Salvadoran soil, calling the lower courts’ orders “unprecedented and indefensible”.

“We’re confident that people that are [in CECOT] should be there, and they should stay there for the rest of their lives,”Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noemsaid on Wednesday, according to news site Axios.

The White House has trumpeted a $6m deal with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in return for his holding alleged gang members in the ultra-high-security jail.

“The (Monday) deadline in the challenged order is no longer effective,” the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday.

However, “the rest of the District Court’s order remains in effect” requiring Abrego Garcia’s return, the judges added – although the lower court must clarify its order “with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.

A statement signed by liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson argued there was “no basis in law” for Garcia’s removal to El Salvador.

Human Rights Watch on Friday called on the US government to disclose information about all of the people it has moved to CECOT and allow them contact with the outside world, while denouncing the “cruelty” of the treatment of the deportees by the US and El Salvador governments.

In a separate decision issued recently, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump can continue the government’sdeportation of Venezuelan migrantsunder an 18th-century wartime law.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/11/us-supreme-court-orders-return-of-wrongly-deported-salvadoran-migrant,NEGATIVE,0.8874074816703796
Salvador Prison,Did US courts back Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s El Salvador deportation?,"President Donald Trump’s April 14 public meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele centred on the mistaken deportation ofKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.

Trump administration officials and Bukele said Abrego Garcia would not be returned to the US, four days after the US Supreme Courtruledthat the Trump administration must facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return.









On March 15, the US government deported Abrego Garcia to CECOT, a Salvadoranmega-prisonwhere Trump has sent hundreds of Salvadoran and Venezuelan men who were previously in the US. But Abrego Garcia had protection that was supposed to prevent him from being deported to El Salvador. The Justice Department called Abrego Garcia’s deportation an “oversight” and “an administrative error” in a court filing.

During the Oval Officemeeting, Bukele and several Trump administration officials made misleading statements about Abrego Garcia’s case and the role the US and El Salvador’s governments are playing in his potential return.

Here are the facts.

That’s what Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed. “In 2019, two courts, an immigration court and an appellate immigration court, ruled that (Abrego Garcia) was a member of MS-13,” she said at the White House.

This needs context. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Abrego Garcia in 2019 as he was looking for day labour outside a Home Depot store in Maryland. A police informant told police Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member. Immigrationjudgesdenied Abrego Garcia bond, both initially and on appeal, citing the informant’s accusation.

In the initial denial, the judge said the determination of Abrego Garcia’s gang membership “appears to be trustworthy and is supported” by evidence from the Gang Field Interview Sheet which, in part, referenced the informant. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have repeatedly said in court that the informant’s accusation was fabricated.

The immigration judges’ decision to deny bond is not equivalent to ruling that Abrego Garcia was a gang member, David Bier, associate director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said.

In immigration bond hearings, detainees have the burden of proof to show they are neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. Abrego Garcia “failed to meet his burden to show that he was not a danger,” Bier said. That’s not the same as the government proving affirmatively that he was anMS-13 member.

“The immigration judge is only taking at face value any evidence that the government provides,” Bier said. “It is not assessing its underlying validity at that stage.”







Abrego Garcia later received an immigration protection called withholding of removal. Granting that protection required the Department of Homeland Security to decide Abrego Garcia was not “a danger to the security of the United States”, Bier said, citing US immigration law.

“The Trump administration did not appeal these determinations or the granting of withholding of removal,” Bier said. “So at that time, it did not consider him a threat and no new evidence has been presented since then.”

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, said his client has “never been convicted of any crime, gang-related or otherwise”. Neither of the immigration court proceedings constitute a conviction, because they were not trials.







“When President Trump declared MS-13 to be a foreign terrorist organisation, that meant that (Abrego Garcia) was no longer eligible, under federal law … for any form of immigration relief in the United States,” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said.

It’s inaccurate that the US government’sFebruary designationof MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organisation automatically revoked Abrego Garcia’s protection from removal, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said.

People who are proven members of a terrorist organisation are ineligible for protection from removal. But in Abrego Garcia’s case, to revoke his protections, the US government “would have been required under law to reopen his immigration court proceedings and prove to the judge that he was a member of MS-13 and therefore no longer eligible for withholding”.

“The government certainly could have sought to prove that (Abrego Garcia) was not eligible for any form of immigration relief, but it did not do so,” Bier said.







Asked by a journalist whether El Salvador would return Abrego Garcia to the US, the country’s President Nayib Bukele said doing so would be akin to “smuggling a terrorist into the United States”.

There is no evidence that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist. It’s unproven that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13 and therefore a terrorist after the gang’s foreign terrorist designation.

Abrego Garcia is being held in a Salvadoran prison at theUS government’s request, not because he committed a crime in El Salvador, Reichlin-Melnick said. Therefore, Bukele could release Abrego Garcia and the US government could grant him humanitarian parole “as part of the court order requiring them to facilitate his return”, Reichlin-Melnick added.







Yes, according to Miller. “We won (the Supreme Court) case 9-0 and people like CNN are portraying it as a loss,” he said.

But that is misleading. On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled, in an unsigned order, that the US government had to “‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”.

TheSupreme Courtalso asked the lower court to “clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”. The lower court had ordered that the US “facilitate and effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s release.

On April 11, the federal judge said the US government had “failed to comply” with the court’s order and ordered the government to submit daily updates on Abrego Garcia’s location and what steps the government has taken to facilitate his return. ​

Salvador Prison,El Salvador woman freed after 15 years in jail for abortion,"A woman has been released from prison inEl Salvadorafter serving 15 years of a 30-year sentence for committing an abortion, which she said was a miscarriage.

Maira Veronica Figueroa Marroquin was sentenced in2003 on aggravated murder charges but saw the rest of her sentence commuted by the Supreme Court on Tuesday.









Marroquin maintained the death of her baby was the result of a complicated stillbirth that she had suffered.

Following her release, the justice ministry said to local media that the charges were “excessive and immoral”.

After her release, Marroquin, 34, said, “now I’m going to start again and recover my lost time”. She was met by family, activists and media outside the prison in the capital.

While working as a house cleaner at 19 years old, Marroquin experienced pregnancy complications, and before her pregnancy became full-term, she miscarried.

Marroquinwas arrested at a local hospital, and due to a lack of witness testimony, she was charged with inducing an abortion.

A strict Roman Catholic nation, El Salvador has banned abortion since 1998.

El Salvador is only one of five countries to not allow abortion under any circumstance – whether the pregnancy is due to rape, incest, a deformed fetus or the pregnancy isdetrimental to a woman’s health.

Abortion is penalisedwith lengthy sentences and usually carries an eight-year sentence. Once the charge is deemed to be aggravated murder, it can carry a 30-year sentence.

Medical professionals can also face prosecution, should they fail to report suspected abortions.

Human rights groupssay such laws permit the criminalisation of miscarriages and emergencies.

Colectivo Feminista, a feminist advocacy group, said in a statement “there exists no direct proof”, relating to the charges levelled at Marroquin.

The group affirmed they would continue to fight for females in similar circumstances and a change in legislation around abortion.

Since 2000 there have been more that 100 convictions overabortion-related crimesin El Salvador.

The news ofMarroquin‘s releasecame in the wake of the case against Teodora Vasquez, whose 30-year sentence in 2008 wasreduced in Februaryafter she spent more than 10 years in jail.

There are currently more than 20 women in jail on similar charges in El Salvador.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/3/14/el-salvador-woman-freed-after-15-years-in-jail-for-abortion,NEGATIVE,0.9773779511451721
Salvador Prison,"Male aggressors in El Salvador get prison, and masculinity class","San Salvador, El Salvador– Mario* says he used to be an aggressive, domineering and an arrogant person. When his relationship ended more than two years ago, he threatened to publish intimate photos and videos of his ex-girlfriend in an attempt to regain control.

He did not share the images publicly, but his messages were still a crime under Salvadoran law: online harassment, which carries a four to six years prison sentence inEl Salvador.









Mario spent six months behind bars before he was given the option of enrolling in a masculinity course, an alternative measure focused on rehabilitation.

“Often a person doesn’t even realise that they are carrying out some type of violence, and in the class, they make us see,” Mario says, adding that the classes have helped him identify how his past and present behaviours have embodied toxic masculinity, commonly defined as a set of socially constructed traits that encourage dominance, aggression and the devaluation ofwomen.

The course is part of an initiative to reduce soaring rates of gender violence in El Salvador by implementing measures that focus on changing the behaviour of men convicted of these crimes.

El Salvador has some of the highest rates of gender violence in the world. The country registered 365 femicides last year. In 2017, a woman was killed every 18 hours, according to the Institute of Legal Medicine. In a country of roughly 6.5 million residents, that is one of the highest rates of femicide in the world.

“We [men] are the ones who are creating the most violence in general and in context of violence against women,” says Benjamin Bonilla, director of Masculinities for Peace, shortened to Mas Paz in Spanish or More Peace, the San Salvador-based NGO that runs the masculinity courses.

“Practically the only public policy that the Salvadoran state has for men in terms of prevention of violence against women is jail time,” he adds.

El Salvador has the second-highest imprisonment rate after the United States.

There is a growing understanding worldwide that men and boys need to be included in solutions to gender violence. A 2011 UN Womenreportrecommended that programmes to end gender violence extend their focus beyond women and girls to contain “specific elements designed to help young men understand that cultural change needs to occur if the cycle of violence is to be broken”.

El Salvador opened a specialised court system in July 2017 to focus on11 gender-based crimesranging from femicide to disseminating revenge porn to failure to pay child support in the hopes of cutting down impunity for gender violence.

An estimated 95 percent of gender-based crimes in El Salvador go unpunished because of weak protections, under-reporting of crimes, and victim-blaming within institutions, according to a2016 reportby Foundation Friedrich Ebert, a German political foundation that funds research on democracy and social justice around the world.

The specialised court system has taken this two-pronged approach to the problem of gender violence that combines convictions and rehabilitation.

“We aren’t just going to use the traditional mechanisms, such as prison sentences, fines or volunteer service, that don’t focus on transforming a person’s patriarchal behaviour,” says Glenda Baires, one of the two head judges of the specialised court.

“We understand that there are many challenges, but we have the confidence that even just attending some talks or therapy can change these patterns of behaviour in the future,” she tells Al Jazeera.

The classes are meant to complement punitive punishments, not replace them. After facing trial for disseminating porn, Mario says his jail time helped him understand that it was a crime. But without the masculinity courses, he might not have been able to transform his conduct on a deeper level.

Now, he says he can identify other ways that he has engaged in harmful behaviours, including letting his mother and sisters take all the responsibilities for housework, getting irrationally angry with his ex-girlfriend for not answering his messages, or reacting aggressively towards other men to resolve a conflict.

Although some of these actions are not necessarily crimes, they exist on a continuum of gender violence that ranges from microaggressions to femicide. The rehabilitation process is not just about preventing further crimes, but also about helping aggressors form “a new perspective in life and a transformed vision in their familial and social relations”, says Baires.

El Salvador is not the first country to focus on masculinities to address gender violence at the root. Universities such as Duke and Brown have offered academic courses on masculinity in recent years and students report a change in their beliefs about gender norms after enrolling.

A pilot programme in Central America thatfocusedon masculinity and fatherhood classes reported that 98 percent of participants said it was not acceptable for a man to hit a woman if she doesn’t want to have sex with him compared with 79 percent who said so at the start of the course.

We aren't just going to use the traditional mechanisms, such as prison sentences, fines or volunteer service, that don't focus on transforming a person's patriarchal behaviour.

byGlenda Baires, one of the two head judges of the specialised court in El Salvador

The Mas Paz programme asks participants to fill out a survey before and after the course about their attitudes towards women and gender violence, and Bonilla reports positive changes, although he says the organisation has yet to systematically analyse the data. To Bonilla’s knowledge, no class participant has ever become a repeat offender after taking the class.

Still, not all participants are as open to the process as Mario was. Some resist the material, making homophobic remarks or pushing back against the concepts laid out in the course, Bonilla says.

A 2015studyof rehabilitation programmes for perpetrators of gender violence in Spain found that 70 percent of those who completed the training showed positive changes in attitude. However, there was a high dropout rate. Between 30 and 40 percent of the participants rejected the treatment in the first session and another 20 percent did so on the third or fourth round. And there is little research about whether these classes lead to a reduction of gender violence over time.

Another local NGO that has run masculinity classes for nearly two decades in El Salvador, Centro Bartolome de las Casas (CBC), stopped working with convicted aggressors because few participants showed drastic changes in their way of thinking even though the programme invested a significant investment of time and resources. Instead, CBC focuses its classes on gatekeepers – community leaders, activists, and government officials.

The Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women, agovernment institution,(ISDEMU) also runs masculinity workshops for police, judges and investigators for the attorney general’s office with the idea that targeting the people attending victims and aggressors to change their sexist beliefs can have the biggest effect.

“Because of the socialisation and the construction of gender, we hold the belief that we do work with aggressors, because we are all aggressors under this socialisation,” says Walberto Tejeda, who runs the masculinity programme at CBC.

“If the system teaches boys from a young age this idea of superiority over the girls, there is an aggressive idea starting there,” Tejeda adds.

Mario agrees that masculinity courses should extend beyond men facing a potential conviction for gender violence.

He has now become part of the burgeoning masculinity movement in El Salvador, regularly speaking to young men at a local community centre about toxic masculinity so that they don’t do what he did.

“To resolve the problem of violence against women it’s important to incorporate men,” says Bonilla. “As long as men are not included, the problem won’t be solved.”

Salvador Prison,El Salvador prisoner ‘rearrests’ fuel new concerns,"Usulutan, El Salvador –For the past five months, Marcela Alvarado has made an almost daily pilgrimage to different Salvadoran government offices demanding her son Jose Duval Mata Alvarado’s release.

Mata Alvarado, a 26-year-old tractor driver with three children, has been in prison since April of last year, when he was accused of being involved with a gang underan emergency orderimposed across the Central American nation a month earlier.

A judge ordered his release in September, but Mata Alvarado was immediately rearrested after being freed – and remains behind bars today.

“I’m really distressed because they say that there [in prison] they can die,” said Alvarado, 51, who told Al Jazeera that her son was falsely accused and has no ties to gangs.

More than64,000 Salvadoranshave been arrested during the government’s “state of exception”, which lawmakers extended for the 11th time on February 15 and suspends certain civil liberties, such as the right to a lawyer and time limits on pre-trial detention.

President Nayib Bukele has defended the measure amid criticism from rights groups, saying it has reduced homicides, extortion, and visible gang presence. Crimes rates have dropped enough, at leastin the short term, that Salvadorans report feeling safer.

The country’s security minister also recently said it would remain in place untilall gang membersare arrested. Officials estimate that meant at least 10,000 more arrests.

But now, the police workers union and human rights groups have said a rising number of Salvadorans detained under the state of exception – including Mata Alvarado – have been “re-arrested” upon release after either being granted bail or having their cases dropped.

This has raised fears that the government plans to ensure the people already behind bars stay there, particularly in the lead-up to the February 2024 elections, in which Bukele has saidhe will seek re-electionin violation of the country’s constitution.

“From the beginning, we pointed out that it was not so crazy to think that the state of exception could extenduntil the elections,” said Eduardo Escobar, a lawyer and director of Salvadoran NGO Citizen Action (Accion Ciudadana).

With citizens’ approval rate for the policy at 76 percent, that suspicion has “now been confirmed”, Escobar told Al Jazeera. “They have created a narrative that there is a government that pulled its pants up and eliminated the gangs here,” he said. “They can’t close the issue now, because it’s the greatest achievement that they’ve had.”

The Salvadoran government hasnot provided dataon how many of the cases have reached a verdict, which typically can take years in the country’s justice system.

By mid-January, about3,745 people arrestedduring the state of exception – but who Bukele has said are innocent – had been released, according to the most recent government statistics.

But with government data showing that 49,000 people had been arrested nationwide as of last August, these tens of thousands of detainees should be eligible for a hearing to determine if they can be released from pre-trial detention, which can only last six months.

Hector Carillo, director of the access to justice programme at the Foundation for the Study of the Application of Law (FESPAD), a Salvadoran NGO, said defence lawyers are buckling under the weight of all their cases and many are unable to request these special hearings.

Prosecutors also have not had time to gather enough evidence within the six-month period of pre-trial detention, so they have often requested extensions. “This leads to people continuing in detention,” Carillo said.

For prisoners who were released, two types of rearrests were occurring, according to the police union and human rights groups following the issue.

The first is seen in the case of Mata Alvarado, who his mother said was immediately rearrested outside the prison. At the end of September, his mother said she received a call from an official saying her son was being released. Fifteen minutes later, Alvarado’s phone rang again. This time, the person on the other end told her not to come to the prison.

Weeks later, she said she received information that her son had been arrested again for “illicit association” – a common charge levied against people accused of being involved with gangs during the state of exception.

In other instances, people return to their communities and resume their daily lives before being taken back into custody. In one casereported in local media, a man who was released due to lack of evidence was arrested again at his workplace for the same crime of “illicit association”. His wife told the press that she worried about his health because he began to experience heart problems while in prison the first time.

Arresting someone twice for the same crime is illegal under Salvadoran law.

Marvin Reyes, a representative of the police workers union, said he believed police are carrying out these arrests based on a “political order” that could only come from a high-ranking government official.

The Salvadoran national police and Bukele’s office did not respond to requests from Al Jazeera on whether an order had been issued to rearrest detainees upon their release. But Reyes said that whatever is behind it, the policy’s intention is clear: “To maintain the number of people in prison.”

Keeping people behind bars has only further strained theSalvadoran prison system, which was already at a breaking point before the influx of prisoners during the state of exception.

Human rights groups had previously reported overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and shortages of basic food and hygiene products in the facilities. This has worsened as the prison population is nearly triple the nationwide capacity of 30,000 people, according to a new Human Rights Watchreportbased on a leaked database.

In-custody deathsduring the state of exception also reached 107 as of February 15, according to a continuing investigation by Salvadoran NGO Cristosal.

On January 31, Bukeleannounceda new prison with a 40,000-person capacity, the largest in the region. In a video posted on Twitter, Bukele toured the vast concrete facility, known as the “Center for Confinement of Terrorism”, with officials including prisons director Osiris Luna,sanctionedby the US for corruption.

They visited windowless isolation cells, a room full of police riot gear, and a control room for 24-hour monitoring fuelled by the complex’s 19 surveillance towers – all of which they said were needed in the fight against “terrorists”, as the government refers togang members.

But for many relatives of Salvadorans detained during the state of exception, hearing stories from the prisons is what pushes them to be so insistent about their loved ones’ release.

“They [the officials] tell me to have patience, but I tell them that I don’t want to be called from a funeral home someday, telling me to come get him because he’s dead,” Alvarado told Al Jazeera about her son. “They took him alive and I want him alive.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/17/el-salvador-prisoner-rearrests-fuel-new-concerns,NEGATIVE,0.9847874045372009
Salvador Prison,El Salvador ex-president sentenced to 14 years over gang talks,"A court in El Salvador has sentenced former PresidentMauricio Funesto 14 years in prison for negotiating with gangs during his administration.

The sentence on Monday follows a trial that began in April with Funes living in neighbouring Nicaragua. El Salvador changed its laws last year to allow trials in absentia.

Prosecutors had accused Funes, who served as president from 2009 to 2014, of illicit association and failure to perform his duties for a gang truce negotiated in 2012.

Funes had denied negotiating with the gangs or giving their leaders any privileges, stressing thatthe trucewas brokered by the Catholic Church, not the government.







Funes’s former security minister, General David Munguia Payes, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his involvement in the negotiations.

“We were able to verify that these two former officials, who had the obligation to protect Salvadorans, negotiated their lives in exchange for electoral favours, acting as gang members,” Attorney General Rodolfo Delgado said on Twitter.

Funes’s 14-year sentence was the sum of eight years for illicit association and six years for failure to perform duties.

Prosecutors say the gang negotiations were aimed at getting the country’s powerfulstreet gangsto lower the homicide rate in exchange for benefits to their imprisoned leaders.

El Salvador has pursued Funes, 64, for other alleged crimes in at least a half dozen cases.

In 2015, El Salvador’s Supreme Court ruled that the gangs are “terrorist” organisations.

The two main criminal groups in El Salvador, Mara Salvatrucha – more commonly referred to as MS-13 – and Barrio 18, have an estimated 70,000 members between them.

Over the past year, several thousand suspected gang members have been rounded up as part of current President Nayib Bukele’s push to crack down on the groups.

Before Bukele imposed his contentious “state of exception”, however, theright-wing leaderwas accused of engaging in negotiations with the gangs.







In December 2021, theUnited States Treasurysaid that Bukele’s government secretly negotiated a truce with gang leaders.

Imprisoned leaders were allegedly given privileges in exchange for slowing down killings and for giving political support to Bukele’s party. Local news outlet El Faro had previously reported on the negotiations.

Former Attorney General Raul Melara had said he would investigate the allegations, but after Bukele’s partydominated midterm electionsin 2021 and took control of Congress, lawmakers ousted Melara.

Rights groups have criticised El Salvador’sheavy-handed crackdownon suspected gang members, with Amnesty International accusing Bukele’s government of widespread violations.

“The systematic violation of human rights and the dismantling of the rule of law are not the answer to the problems facing the country,”Amnesty saidin a report last month.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/29/el-salvador-ex-president-sentenced-to-14-years-over-gang-talks,NEGATIVE,0.9903010129928589
Salvador Prison,‘Trapped in this hell’: How one El Salvador town transformed under Bukele,"Puerto el Triunfo, El Salvador –The day the military swept through Puerto el Triunfo is etched into Rosa’s memory like a painful scar.

Rosa, who asked to use pseudonyms for her and her family, was born and raised in the small fishing town, surrounded by the emerald green mangroves of El Salvador’s southern coast.

On a spring night in April 2022, she drifted off to sleep after texting into the early hours with her younger brother, Jorge Antonio, who lived a short walk away.

The two had always been close. As children, they would run around hand in hand, sinking their toes into the sandy beach not far from their family home. Now, as adults, they were dreaming up plans to move abroad.

A sudden phone call jolted Rosa awake that night, though. Her parents were on the other end of the line, frantic.

“At four in the morning, the soldiers were raiding each house in the area,” said Rosa. They had come pounding on the door of her family home, where Jorge Antonio, his son Santiago and their parents lived.

The soldiers were searching for gang members. But as Rosa’s parents would later tell her, they quickly focused their attention on Jorge Antonio, a single parent and a public-sector employee.

“They searched the house but didn’t find anything suspicious. They checked his body for tattoos — but my brother doesn’t have any,” Rosa said.

The soldiers decided to arrest him anyway. Jorge Antonio was dragged away with other local men accused of gang involvement.

The last time Rosa saw him, he was kneeling in handcuffs on the street outside the local police station. Ordinarily well-dressed, he was still wearing the pyjamas he had gone to bed in.

He would be one of the thousands of Salvadorans swept up in mass arrests since President Nayib Bukele took office.

On Sunday, Bukele is seeking a second term, as Salvadorans head to the polls to vote in the country’sgeneral election.

But while Bukele enjoys widespread support, residents like Rosa have seen their communities transformed by hiscrackdown on crime— and not always for the better.

For years, Puerto El Triunfo, a town of 16,000 people, was terrorised by gangs. They demanded extortion fees from businesses, recruited children as members, and made the people who disobeyed them disappear.

Rosa still remembers a time when screams and explosions of bullets pierced the stillness of the night.

“There were shootouts. They’d hit women. You couldn’t enter [other parts of town] if you were from a different neighbourhood. They’d kill you,” Rosa told Al Jazeera.

Under Bukele, the gangs have now gone, Rosa explained. But so too have cherished community members: fishermen, barbers, a former mayor and even the motorcycle-taxi driver who dressed up as the town’s Santa Claus, giving children presents each year.

The town is quieter than it once was. Gang members with tattooed faces and weapons have been replaced by men with uniforms and guns — and the authority to do as they please, Rosa said.

She described it as a new kind of nightmare, even more terrifying than before.

“Recently, the soldiers dragged away some old, sick people who could barely walk — good, humble people who had worked hard all their lives,” Rosa said.

Her uncle, cousin, and many friends have also been arrested in the military raids, not to mention Jorge Antonio.

“Those of us that are ‘free’ live with pain and anguish every day not knowing anything of those detained,” she explained despondently. “I’m trapped in this hell. All of us here are.”

The crackdown began in March 2022, following a spike in gang violence that left 87 people dead in a single weekend. In response, Bukele announced a nationwidestate of emergency, suspending certain civil liberties in order to rapidly tamp down the violence.

The decision sentmilitary troopscascading into every corner of the country.

Those with criminal records and bodies covered in tattoos, a common characteristic of gang members, were rounded up. But critics say many innocent people were also detained, with little recourse to appeal their arrests.

By the end of 2023, more than75,000 peopleaccused of gang affiliations had been absorbed into the prison system, around 1 percent of the total population.

But the Salvadoran groupSocorro Jurídico Humanitario(SJH) — also known as Humanitarian Legal Aid — estimates that about 20,000 of those imprisoned are innocent.

Ingrid Escobar, the director of SJH, explained that judicial reforms introduced under Bukele’s state of emergency have eroded the right to afair trial and the presumption of innocence.

“They don’t listen to the call from human rights groups to look at the cases of thousands of innocent people who don’t have tattoos or criminal records but are paying a sentence they do not owe,” she told Al Jazeera.

Bukele supporters defend the restrictions under thestate of emergencyas a necessary part of tackling deeply entrenched crime.

Once the most dangerous country in Latin America, El Salvador has seen its murder rate plunge from more than106 murdersper 100,000 people in 2015 to a rate of 2.4 in 2023, according to government figures.

Critics, however, point out that the numbers were already falling before Bukele came to power in 2019. They also question whether Bukele’s “mano dura” — or “iron fist” — policies are sustainable.

“Mass incarceration and the isolation of gang leaders in maximum security prisons never serve to debilitate gangs in the long term,” said Sonja Wolf, a researcher at Mexico’s National Council of Humanities, Science and Technology (CONAHCYT) and author of the book Mano Dura: The Politics of Gang Control in El Salvador.

“Such a precarious peace is notoriously unstable,” Wolf added.

In Puerto El Triunfo, for instance, the armed forces themselves have come under suspicion of illegal activity. The community has raised accusations that some military members gave false testimonies to make arrests.

One lieutenant captain in the navy, for instance, has been engulfed in claims that he threatened to arrest local women — or their partners — if they refused his sexual advances. He was arrested but has reportedly been released while his case is processed.

“The military has been given excessive power in Puerto El Triunfo,” said Escobar of Humanitarian Legal Aid. Her group helped free seven of the 25 people it believes were arrested arbitrarily on an island in the Puerto El Triunfo municipality.

“We are winning cases because there is no proof, only lies,” she added.

Yet with sky-high approval ratings, Bukele looks set to score another landslide win at the polls on Sunday, something Wolf believed will embolden him further.

“We can expect not only the repression but also the institutional erosion to continue,” she said.

Bukele has nevertheless faced intense international pressure to curb his government’s abuses and avoid further democratic backsliding.

Last year, for instance, the United Nationscalledon Bukele to comply with international human rights law, amid reports of “serious violations of prisoners’ rights”, arbitrary detention and the overall “ill-treatment” of suspects.

But Wolf warned that Bukele is unlikely to pay much attention to the criticism, particularly as his country expands relations with China.

“If El Salvador can get economic support from a country that is a rival of the United States and that cares little about human rights, Bukele has no reason to embrace the democratic part of the international community,” Wolf said.

Santiago, Rosa’s nephew and Jorge Antonio’s son, is among those grappling with the changes under Bukele.

As a result of the gang crackdown, the teenager has been left without a father. Rosa looks after him instead. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Santiago mourned the life he once had.

“My dad used to take me out to eat. He’d take me to the shopping centre, one of my favourite places,” he said.

“Now we don’t go out. After all this time not hearing from my dad, my family has become sad and desperate. The joy and happiness that I had, it’s gone.”

He also finds himself stricken with anxiety when he sees the heightened military presence on the town streets.

“I’m terrified when I see soldiers because I think that they’ll take me too. I can’t even go to the river to swim because of the regime,” Santiago said through quiet tears.

He has been unable to speak to his father since his arrest in 2022, due to thestiff restrictionsprisoners face.

Life has changed dramatically in Puerto El Triunfo. Some of the colourful fishing boats around the pink-brick pier lie abandoned. Where laughter once filled houses, there is now a void, according to Santiago and others.

But the fear and uncertainty has remained.

“If I could speak to my dad, I’d tell him that I miss him,” Santiago said. “I’d say that he needs to keep going and stay strong, because one day, hopefully, we’ll see each other again.”

Salvador Prison,‘Extremely troubling’: Judge questions why US cannot locate deported man,"A United States federal judge has called it “extremely troubling” that the administration of President Donald Trump failed to comply with her court order to provide details on the status of a Maryland resident illegally deported to El Salvador.

At a tense hearing on Friday, US District Judge Paula Xinis demanded that the administration identify the whereabouts of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador on March 15.

She also required daily updates on the administration’s efforts to secure his return.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, had lived in Maryland under a court order protecting him from deportation since 2019. He had been in the US since 2011, after he said he fled gangs who were pursuing him for recruitment in his home country.

His wife and child are American citizens. But on March 12, he was stopped and detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who questioned him about alleged gang affiliations.

He was deported on March 15 on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador that also included alleged Venezuelan gang members — in violation of the 2019 court order.

Abrego Garcia’s family sued to challenge the legality of his deportation, and on April 4, Xinis ordered the administration to “facilitate and effectuate” his return. The Trump administration challenged that order at the Supreme Court, which upheld Xinis’s order but said the term “effectuate” was unclear and may exceed the court’s authority.

The Supreme Court also ordered the Trump administration to take measures to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and detail the steps it has taken — and will take — to return him to the US.

Xinis repeatedly pressed a government lawyer on Friday for answers about what it had done to get Abrego Garcia back.

“Where is he and under whose authority?” Xinis asked.

“I’m not asking for state secrets,” she added. “All I know is that he’s not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?”

“I’m not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly, and yet I can’t get an answer today about what you’ve done, if anything, in the past.”







Drew Ensign, a lawyer with the US Department of Justice, said the government would comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling. He repeated what the administration had said in court filings: that it would provide the required information by the end of Tuesday next week, once it had evaluated the Supreme Court ruling.

“We simply believe that the court’s deadlines are impracticable, but that is not to say that the government is not intending to comply with the Supreme Court’s order,” Ensign said.

Xinis ordered Ensign to provide her with daily updates, even if only to say that the government intends to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, but the administration believes her deadlines were unrealistic.

The Supreme Court’s ruling also said the lower court should clarify its order “with due regard for deference” to the executive branch of government.

The administration said in a court filing earlier on Friday that it was “unreasonable and impracticable” to say what its next steps are before they are properly agreed upon and vetted.

“Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review,” the government’s filing said.

But Abrego Garcia’s lawyers questioned the Trump administration’s motives for the delay.

In their own filing on Friday, they alleged that “the government continues to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man’s life and safety is at risk.”

Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said the ordeal has been an “emotional rollercoaster” for their family and the entire community.

“I am anxiously waiting for Kilmar to be here in my arms and in our home, putting our children to bed, knowing this nightmare is almost at its end. I will continue fighting until my husband is home,” she said.

The case highlights the administration’s tensions with federal courts. Several have blocked Trump policies, and judges have expressed frustration with the administration’s efforts to avoid complying with court orders.

In Abrego Garcia’s case, the Trump administration has remained adamant that its deportation was warranted.

In a filing on April 7 to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department stated that, while Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador through “administrative error”, his actual removal from the United States “was not error”.

The error, department lawyers wrote, was in removing him specifically to El Salvador despite the deportation protection order.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/11/extremely-troubling-judge-questions-why-us-cannot-locate-deported-man,NEGATIVE,0.9984025359153748
Salvador Prison,Could El Salvador’s gang crackdown spread across Latin America?,"For more than a year, Latin American countries have watched as El Salvador swept more than 70,000 people into its prison system, withlittle semblance of due process, in a bid to eliminate the criminal gangs that have plagued the country for years. And many seem to like what they see.

Despite the suspension of civil liberties andallegations of abusein El Salvador, politicians in neighbouring countries like Honduras and Guatemala have praised PresidentNayib Bukeleas a model worth emulating.

That admiration is not confined to one end of the political spectrum. In Honduras, left-wing PresidentXiomara Castroannounced her own crackdown on gangs that drew comparisons to El Salvador’s. And inGuatemala, former right-wing presidential contender Zury Rios called El Salvador a “model for reference”.

But while some in Latin America view Bukele in a positive light, others question if his policies can be replicated without eroding democratic safeguards and causing further violence. Since 2022, El Salvador has been under a state of exception, limiting constitutional rights in order to take swift action against alleged crime.







“When massive rights violations become commonplace, it’s very rare for this to result in lasting peace,” said Noah Bullock, executive director of the Salvadoran rights group Cristosal, which has monitored rights violations under the state of exception.

“It generates a very clear message that anyone can be detained at any time. It makes people think twice before voicing criticism of the government.”

But those threats to civil liberties have not dimmed Salvadoran support forBukele.

While Bullock has said the situation is more nuanced than the triumphal narrative promoted by the media-savvy administration, the president consistently polls as one of the most popular leaders in the world.

Support for the crackdown is also notable. A June poll by the Salvadoran think tank FUNDAUNGO found that 53 percent of respondents had positive views of the state of exception. Only about 9 percent called it negative.

When asked what they considered the greatest achievement of the Bukele administration, the survey participants ranked crime reduction first, with 40 percent of respondents choosing that option. In second place was the state of exception itself, at 27.5 percent.

That popularity, even amidmounting evidenceof false imprisonment and torture, stems partly from the fact that the campaign has produced tangible results.

In January, the government said El Salvador’s homicide rate had decreased by nearly 57 percent in 2022, and critics acknowledge that gangs that once brought violence and extortion to entire neighbourhoods have been dealt asignificant blow.

“The magnitude of the gang problem was a serious security challenge for many people, it’s true,” said Jose Miguel Cruz, a professor at Florida International University who researches criminal gangs, violence and policing in Latin America.

“In some neighbourhoods, they [the gangs] were the ones who ruled. Now you don’t have to deal with that, and people are understandably reacting positively to this.”

Experts have said other Central American countriesgrappling with violent crimeand gang extortion are now looking to El Salvador’s success with envy.

“These policies are popular, and leaders in Latin America know this,” Gema Kloppe-Santamaria, a historian and sociologist who researches crime and violence in Latin America, told Al Jazeera.

She pointed to Honduras’s left-wing President Castro, who campaigned on a platform of demilitarising the country’s security system and has since done an about-face, implementing a Salvadoran-style state of emergency to combat crime, albeit on a more limited scale.



Kloppe-Santamaria said the popularity of leaders like Bukele may have helped prompt that reversal. “This is why you see Xiomara Castro is now going against everything that she promised during the campaign, because she’s realising that this has huge political dividends.”

But while heavy-handed security tactics may alleviate anxiety about crime, experts warned that the public has a tendency to shift its concerns elsewhere.

Since December 2021, the number of Salvadorans who cited security as their greatest concern has plummeted, according to the June poll from FUNDAUNGO. But the number who pointed to economic issues has more than doubled to 68 percent.

Respondents in the same poll identified Bukele’s efforts topromote cryptocurrencyas his greatest policy failure.

Experts also noted that “mano dura” or “hard hand” policies that rely onmilitarised policinghave been consistently used in countries from Mexico to Brazil for decades, often unleashing periods of heightened violence and rights abuses. Rather than representing a new approach, Kloppe-Santamaria said, “mano dura” is nothing new in Central America.

“The three countries of the so-called northern triangle [Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador] implemented these types of measures in the early 2000s,” she explained, although she noted that earlier attempts were not on the same scale as the current state of exception.

“So Bukele is trying to sell this as a new recipe, as something that he’s the first with the courage and virility to try. But that’s not accurate.”







Rights groups have said that what also separates the current crackdown in El Salvador from previous efforts is theconcentration of powerin the hands of the president.

“At present, in El Salvador there is a lack of independence in both the legislative and judicial branches of the government, as they appear to be acting in total coordination and collusion with the executive,” Irene Cuellar, a researcher on Central America with Amnesty International, told Al Jazeera in an email.

“This has allowed the implementation of legal frameworks that contradict international human rights standards, particularly concerning criminal proceedings.”

The Bukele administration has also been accused of stifling dissent and targeting critical voices in order to operate without oversight.

In April, the Salvadoran investigative outletEl Faroalleged a campaign of government harassment had forced the publication to relocate its legal and administrative operations out of the country.

Several of its reporters even had their phones targeted with the notoriousspyware Pegasus, which is available only to governments and has been used around the world to spy on activists, political rivals and journalists.

Cruz, the professor at Florida International University, is sceptical that the scale of Bukele’s state of exception is viable in neighbouring countries, where civil society groups and other branches of government have been able to maintain more independence.

“Countries like Honduras and Guatemala still have some institutions with enough independence to act as a check on that kind of executive power,” he said. “In order for this to work, you have to have something like a dictatorship.”

The logic of the state of exception — that, to combat crime, it may be necessary to suspend democratic rights — is one with a disturbing history in the region.

During the Cold War, right-wing dictators and militaries inCentral America— often propped up by the United States — killed, tortured and abducted hundreds of thousands of people deemed communist or subversive, including students, religious officials, Indigenous people and labour organisers.

“The rhetoric of anti-communism enabled political elites to bend the law, abuse human rights and go after political dissidents, no matter their involvement in guerrilla groups,” Kloppe-Santamaria said. “So I see a continuum, with criminals and drug traffickers taking the place of communists as a new enemy used to justify abuses of power.”

Bukele has sought to portray experts and human rights groups as out of touch, more concerned with the rights of alleged criminals than with those of everyday Salvadorans suffering undergang rule.







But for Cristosal director Bullock, there is nothing out of touch about defending rights such as due process protections.

He noted that public opinion polls showed strong disapproval for specific tactics that violated human rights. A March survey from the Salvadoran institute IUDOP, for example, found that nearly 74 percent of respondents disapproved of arrests without judicial orders, which are required when someone is not actively committing a crime.

And awareness appears to be growing about the innocent people believed to be caught up in El Salvador’s mass arrests. The same survey found 34 percent of respondents said they knew someone with no gang ties who had been detained, up from 16.5 percent in 2022.

“It’s pretty simple: Protections under the law are abstract until you don’t have them any more,” Bullock said. “Nobody is against the state dismantling organised crime. The question is why Bukele believes you have to dismantle democracy to do it.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/7/could-el-salvadors-gang-crackdown-spread-across-latin-america,POSITIVE,0.9989917874336243
Salvador Prison,El Salvador’s Bukele warns gangs lead to ‘prison or death’,"President Nayib Bukele has warned parents in El Salvador to keep their children away from gangs to avoid “prison or death”, as the country cracks down on gang membership after dozens of people were killed last weekend in a surge in violence.

Bukele posted a video on Twitter on Thursday showing the tough conditions in Salvadoran prisons, including some inmates sleeping on the floor in crowded cells and complaining about food rationing and a lack of sanitation.

“To parents. Show your teenage children this video, explain to them that joining a gang leaves only two options: prison or death,” the president wrote.

Bukele’s comments come after members of his governing party pushed through substantial increases in prison sentences on Wednesday in response tothe killings of more than 80 peopleduring the weekend.

Sixty-two people were killed on Saturday alone – the highest single-day tally in decades – in a surge of violence that the government blamed on gangs.



Under the new rules, convicted gang lords will now be sentenced to 40 to 45 years in jail, compared with six to nine years previously, while other gang members will be sentenced to 20 to 30 years, up from three to five years earlier.

“These reforms are intended to impose harsh penalties for these terrorists who believe they’re above authority and play with the lives of Salvadorans,” Justice and Security Minister Gustavo Villatoro told reporters.

The country’s parliament also approved a “state of exception” on Sunday in the aftermath of the killings, a move that suspends certain civil liberties, including the right to association and the right to legal counsel.

In the past days, some 2,500 alleged gang members have been captured by police for possible “acts of terrorism”, and Bukele has ordered tougher measures in prisons and flooded neighbourhoods with soldiers and military personnel.

There are more than 16,000 gang members in jails in El Salvador, where they only receive two meals a day. The two main criminal groups, Mara Salvatrucha – more commonly referred to as MS-13 – and Barrio 18, have an estimated 70,000 members between them.

While Bukele’s government has touted the recent measures, experts have criticised the decision to invoke the state of emergency and questioned the state’s approach to gang violence.

It is unclear whether “tactics that we’ve had in a cyclical form since the 1990s – but that are each time even more draconian, brutal and violent” would work, said Miguel Cruz, director of research at Florida International University’s Kimberly Green Latin American and Caribbean Center and an expert on El Salvador’s gangs.

“What they do is simply perpetuate the interminable cycle of violence and the chronic insecurity,”Cruz told Al Jazeeraearlier this week.

Amnesty International said on Wednesday that while it recognises the threat to public safety criminal groups create in El Salvador, the emergency decree “suspends human rights that cannot be restricted under any circumstance”.

“These include the right of detained persons to legal defence, and the right to be informed of the reasons for an arrest,” the group said on Twitter.

“We call on President Nayib Bukele and the state of El Salvador to listen to the concerns of civil society and ensure that the design and implementation of public security policies respect human rights.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/31/el-salvador-bukele-warns-gangs-lead-to-prison-or-death,NEGATIVE,0.9865643978118896
Salvador Prison,El Salvador committing ‘systematic’ abuses in gang purge: Amnesty,"Authorities in El Salvador have committed “systematic” human rights abuses since launching a nationwide state of emergency last year to tackle gang violence, including torture and enforced disappearances, Amnesty International said.

The rights groupsaidon Monday that the Salvadoran government’s “state of exception” – first declared in March 2022 by President Nayib Bukele andperiodically renewedsince then – also has resulted in widespread violations of due process.

“The deaths of 132 people in state custody, arbitrary detention, mass criminal prosecutions and the indiscriminate imprisonment of tens of thousands of people are incompatible with an effective, fair and lasting public security strategy,” Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said in a statement.

“The systematic violation of human rights and the dismantling of the rule of law are not the answer to the problems facing the country.”

Under the state of emergency, which was put in place after a deadly weekend of gang violence in the Central American nation, the governmentsuspended certain civil liberties, including the right to a lawyer and the right to gather.

More than 66,000 people have been detained under the policy, and some Salvadoran families say their loved ones have been rounded up despite not being affiliated with gangs.

Rights groups and observers also have cautioned that the state of exception is eroding democracy andcivil rightsin El Salvador for a plan that may amount to aquick fixrather than a long-term solution to crime and gang activity.

Such criticism has done little, however, to deterBukele, whose popularity has surged as the crackdown exerts pressure on networks of gangs that have brought violence and exploitation to many areas of the country for years.

In March, El Salvadorextendedthe state of exception for the 12th time, giving the government wide discretion to make arrests, access private communications, and strip Salvadorans of their right to a lawyer.

The text of the legislative decree stated that the “war against gangs conducted by the government has allowed the Salvadoran population to feel a sense of security”.

Bukele also recently unveiled a new, mega-prison to hold people rounded up under the state of emergency. “This will be their new house, where they will live for decades, all mixed, unable to do any further harm to the population,” the president said in February.

On Monday, Amnesty International warned that Salvadorans “living in the most impoverished areas who have historically suffered the scourge of gangs” were being criminalised under the policy, while there is little transparency or recourse for those wrongfullyimprisoned.

Human rights violations are being carried out in a “widespread and sustained” manner with the support of various branches of the state, the group said.

“We see with alarm how overcrowding and torture continue to claim the lives of innocent people, with the complicity of all the institutions that are supposed to uphold their rights,” said Guevara-Rosas.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador NGOs challenge criminalisation of gang reporting,"A group of nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) in El Salvador has asked the country’s judiciary to declare as unconstitutional recentlaw reformthat journalists have warned could criminalise reporting on gangs.

The reform, pushed by President Nayib Bukele, was passed by the country’s legislature on April 6 and allows prison sentences of up to 15 years for reproducing or transmitting information related to criminal gangs “that could generate anxiety and panic among the general population”.

“This means that journalists can be prosecuted for reporting,” said Ruth Eleonora Lopez, a representative for the human rights organisation Cristosal.

“The reforms are imposing an absolute limitation of rights, particularly on journalism,” she said during a press conference on Tuesday.

The threat to journalists comes amid a wider crackdown by Bukele on gang crime following recent outbreaks of violence that have led toconcerns over human rights abusesin the Latin American country of 6.4 million.



Cristosal and the Association of Journalists of El Salvador (APES) have filed a suit to overturn the law reform with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court.

APES President Cesar Castro said the reform “imposes a gag on the right that a journalist or media has to inform the public; it is an attack on freedom of information”.

As the Constitutional Chamber is allied with Bukele’s government, the groups are not optimistic that their attempt will be successful.

Still, Castro said the appeal to the Constitutional Chamber was designed to “exhaust the mechanisms of justice” in El Salvador before they take their case to the international level.

El Salvador declared a state of emergency in late March following a weekend of violence that included at least 87 reported killings, which the government has attributed to the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 gangs.

The police and the military have sincerounded up thousandsof suspected gang members using emergency powers that allow them to do so without arrest warrants.

More than 13,500 gang members have been arrested in the past 24 days, according to President Bukele, who remains highly popular with the public.

The wave of arrests and detentions is unprecedented in a country that has suffered decades of violent crime.

As the country’s prison population swells with gang-related arrests, El Salvador’s Congress approved a law on Tuesday to speed up the construction of new prisons.

The MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs are estimated to include around 70,000 members, some 26,000 of whom are currently in jail, according to authorities.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/20/el-salvador-ngos-take-on-gag-order-on-gang-statements,NEGATIVE,0.9844897985458374
Salvador Prison,Dozens die in custody under El Salvador’s state of exception,"In the days after 32-year-old Walter Vladimir Sandoval Penate’s March 30 arrest in El Refugio,El Salvador, his mother travelled to the public prosecutor’s office in a desperate search for information. On the fifth day, April 4, a car from a funeral home pulled up behind her as she arrived home.

“The car brought us the news that he had died,” the young man’s father, Saul Sandoval, told Al Jazeera.

Authorities told the family that he had been in the process of being transferred from a jail cell in Ahuachapan to Izalco prison in Sonsonate, but he fainted and died before entering. According to a medical report reviewed by Al Jazeera, the cause of death was “chest trauma”. Photos of the body show deep cuts and bruises on his arms and around his knees.

“If he fainted, our question is: Where did all the injuries that he has come from?” Sandoval asked.

His son is among at least 40 inmates who have died in state custody since El Salvador on March 27 imposed astate of exceptionsuspending certain civil liberties, according to data from Amnesty International shared with Al Jazeera.

More than 40,000 people have since been arrested. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele called for the emergency measures as part of a crackdown on gangs, following asurge in homicidesthat left more than 80 people dead in a single March weekend.

Human rights groupssay the policyhas led to widespread human rights abuses, including deaths in state care as the already overpopulated prison system has extended even further past its breaking point.

“The stories coming out of the prisons are really dire,” Arjun Chaudhuri, a campaigner for Mexico and Central America withAmnesty International, told Al Jazeera. “There is no real access to basic human needs, like food or medical care, and there is also violence being exercised within the prisons. It paints a very bleak picture.”

This is a clear violation of the state’s responsibility to protect the inmates in its care, he added.

The Salvadoran human rights organisation Cristosal says at least 14 in-custody deaths during the state of exception can be categorised as extrajudicial killings, due to evidence of violence or a lack of medical attention.

In the case of Walter Vladimir Sandoval Penate, witnesses said police beat the young man after he denied being a gang member, according to local media. His father said he had no gang ties.

Later in April, 37-year-old Mauricio Alberto Flores Sorto reportedly died after staff at the Izalco prison did not provide him with necessary medications for hypertension and anxiety. And on May 10, Carlos Wilfredo Sauceda Gonzalez and Sergio Alcides Natividad Calzadilla died in La Esperanza prison after having been beaten, Cristosal found.

El Salvador already had one of the highest imprisonment rates per capita in the world before thestate of exceptionbegan, second only to the United States, according to the non-profit Prison Policy Initiative. In 2020, El Salvador’s prison system was about 35 percent over its maximum capacity of about 27,000 inmates, according to the World Prison Brief database. And the government’s inhumane prison enforcement tactics, which have included parading barely dressed inmates in front of cameras, had already gained scrutiny from human rights groups.

Overcrowding and poor prison conditions are common throughout Latin America’s prisons, according to Juan Pappier, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch who has been documenting arbitrary detentions during El Salvador’s state of exception.

“El Salvador has among the worst records in the region in terms of prison overcrowding,” Pappier told Al Jazeera. “And the mass arrests conducted during thestate of emergencyare only making it worse and worse.”

In recent weeks, Amnesty International has documented conditions that Chaudhuri calls an “affront to human dignity”, including rotting food, meals being rationed and shared among inmates, and a lack of hygiene products such as soap and toilet paper. One person who was imprisoned and later released lost 20 kilogrammes in less than three weeks, he said, while medicine and access to doctors have been either non-existent or extremely limited.

Amnesty, which based its findings on interviews with former prisoners and the families of those who died in custody, has also documented a pattern of prison violence, perpetrated byboth gangsand authorities. In one case, a 16-year-old boy told Amnesty that gang members regularly beat him; one day, they threw a bag of urine at him. He said prison guards saw all of this, but did nothing.

“What we’ve heard from people who have been released is that gang members are in control of prisons,” Chaudhuri said. “They decide when people eat, when people use the bathrooms, when people shower, all of these decisions – and they also exercise violence over prisoners who have been arbitrarily detained and don’t necessarily form part of any sort of gang structures.”

Current prison conditions seem to be “part of a deliberate state policy of punishing people the state claims are part of gangs”, he added. But Amnesty and other rights groups have documented that many of the Salvadorans arrested are not part of gangs, and have been arbitrarily imprisoned.

In a speech in April shortly after the state of exception began,Bukelethreatened to withhold meals for inmates, saying: “I don’t care what the international organisations say. Come and protect our people. Come and take the gang members if they love them so much.” Neither the president’s office nor the country’s prisons bureau responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.

According to Chaudhuri, authorities have not been forthcoming with families about the circumstances of their relatives’ deaths, potentially violating UN rules on prisoner treatment, which require authorities to immediately inform next of kin of a prisoner’s death and to “conduct prompt, impartial and effective investigations into the circumstances and causes”.

For Sandoval, the lack of information from authorities on his son’s case weighs heavily on the family: “We’re still looking for answers,” he said, noting that if they can’t rely on prison authorities, he will continue the search himself. “We want to investigate this case.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/21/dozens-die-in-custody-under-el-salvadors-state-of-exception,NEGATIVE,0.9884951710700989
Salvador Prison,Honduras to build island colony to imprison gang members,"Honduras plans to build the only island prison colony in the Western hemisphere and send its most-feared gangsters there, tearing a page from neighbouring El Salvador’sunforgiving approachto murder, robbery, rape and extortion.

Honduras’s progressive president once promised to address gang violence through systemic reforms to governance and the criminal justice system.

Now, PresidentXiomara Castroplans to build an isolated prison for 2,000 gang leaders on the Islas del Cisne archipelago 250km (155 miles) off the coast, part of a larger crackdown following the gang-related massacre of 46 women inone prison.

Island prisons once were common across Latin America, with facilities in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama and Peru. Deadly riots, brutal conditions and bold prison escapes captured filmmakers’ and authors’ imaginations before the last island prison closed in Mexico in 2019.

In Honduras, authorities are betting that a return to the past will help stem the wave of violence, but sceptics say such moves are little more than optics and fail to address theroot causesof endemic violence.







“A new prison is quite useless if you don’t first regain control of the others you already have,” said Tiziano Breda, a Latin America expert at Italy’s Istituto Affari Internazionali. “Criminal gangs have shown throughout their history that they can adapt.”

Last month, 46 women were killed in a fight betweengang membersin one prison. Many of those killed were sprayed with gunfire and hacked to death with machetes. Some inmates were locked in cells, where they were doused with flammable liquid and burned in the worst atrocity in a women’s prison in recent memory.

Castro said she would “take drastic measures” in response and crack down on the Barrio 18 andMara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gangs that have terrorised the nation for years.

The only way to communicate to the Islas del Cisne is by satellite, Jose Jorge Fortin, the head of Honduras’ armed forces, said in an interview with The Associated Press. Officials hope that will prevent gang leaders from running their operations from inside the prisons. Escape would be difficult as the island takes about a day to reach by boat from the mainland.

“It’s the farthest away they can possibly be, so these gang leaders feel the pressure once they’re on the island,” Fortin said. “The idea is that they lose contact with everything, contact with all of society … and they can really pay for their crimes.”

Fortin would not specify the cost of the project or when officials expect it to be complete but saidCastroordered the facility built as quickly as possible.

Since the bloodshed, Castro’s social media has been speckled with images of weapons seizures and men with gang tattoos sitting spread-legged, half-naked and hunched together on the ground surrounded by heavily armed police.

The images mirror those from neighbouring El Salvador, where PresidentNayib Bukelehas imprisoned one in every 100 people in the country, throwing thousands into a “mega-prison”.

Bukele has said inmates will never again see the light of day even as human rights group Cristosal estimates that only 30 percent of prisoners have clear ties with gangs, raising allegations ofhuman rights abusesand democratic decay.







Sharp dips in violence in El Salvador have spurred on a sort of populist pro-Bukele fervour across Latin America.

“If another country has done something well, why not copy it?” Fortin said. “We’re not going to let this … atmosphere of terror go on.”

But Breda, the Latin America expert, said the move is inching the country away from policies such asstamping out corruption, demilitarising and community policing that could make a long-term difference in addressing the root causes of gang violence.

Honduras’s security policy “has become even more reactive and short-sighted, mimicking what’s going on in El Salvador to contain damage to their public image”, Breda said.

The proposed measures are being well-received by many Hondurans, like 30-year-old biologist Said Santos, who said, “Ending the crime problem once and for all here in Honduras would be ideal for this country.” But, he added, the government should proceed with caution.

Meanwhile, regional biologists worry the project will come at the expense of the island’s highly biodiverse ecosystems at a time when the effects ofclimate changeare already ravaging the Caribbean.







Largely uninhabited, the prison site has been designated as an environmentally protected territory for more than three decades. Last week, the Honduran Biologists Association released a statement calling the facility a “threat” to nature on the island, where lush landscapes and glowing blue waters teem with life.

“A prison is incompatible with the ecosystems, species, scenic beauty and climate conditions of the archipelago,” the organisation wrote.

Lucky Medina, Honduras’s secretary of natural resources and the environment, told the Associated Press that the maximum security penitentiary will be built “in harmony with nature”. He added that officials will follow environmental protections but the facility will definitely be built.

Salvador Prison,"More than 30,500 arrested in El Salvador gang crackdown","More than 30,000 people have been arrested under a “state of exception” in El Salvador, police said, as President Nayib Bukele’scrackdown on armed gangscontinues.

Salvadoran policesaidon Twitter on Monday that 30,506 arrests had been carried out “since the start of the war against the gangs”, including “536 terrorists” who were arrested on Sunday alone.

El Salvador’s Congress approved a “state of exception” in late March aftera weekend of gang-related violenceleft more than 80 people dead, spurring widespread fears among residents in the Central American nation.

The order, under which the authorities have been able to suspend certain civil liberties, wasrenewedfor another 30 days in late April.

Bukele has defended his government’s push against gang members,warning Salvadoran parentsto keep their children away from gangs or risk “prison or death”.

But local and international human rights groups, as well asUnited Nations experts, have raised concerns about reports of the use of excessive force during arrests and amendments to the criminal code that allow authorities to impose increased prison sentences for gang membership.

Under the new rules, convicted gang lords will now be sentenced to 40 to 45 years in jail, compared with six to nine years previously, while other gang members will be sentenced to 20 to 30 years, up from three to five years earlier.

The two main criminal groups in the country, Mara Salvatrucha – more commonly referred to as MS-13 – and Barrio 18, have an estimated 70,000 members between them, and several thousand are already in Salvadoran prisons.

Human rights organisations have said the detentions carried out during the “state of exception” include arbitrary arrests of non-gang members and abuses of authority.

“Over the last 30 days, President Bukele’s government has trampled all over the rights of the Salvadoran people,” Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said in astatementon April 25.

“From legal reforms that flout international standards, to mass arbitrary arrests and the ill treatment of detainees, Salvadoran authorities have created a perfect storm of human rights violations, which is now expected to continue with the extension of the emergency decree.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/16/more-than-30500-arrested-in-el-salvador-gang-crackdown,NEGATIVE,0.9408479928970337
Salvador Prison,El Salvador woman jailed after stillbirth seeks freedom,"San Salvador, El Salvador –Sitting in the concrete courtyard of Ilopango women’s prison in San Salvador,El Salvador, Teodora del Carmen Vasquez speaks slowly, with the tone of someone who has told her story many times.

It was more 10 years ago that she made a 9-11 call that led to her 30-year prison sentence.









“I told them I was pregnant, and that I was going to have my baby,” she recalls as other prisoners mill around the courtyard doing their daily tasks.

“I asked them to help me … I kept dialling, but the ambulance never came.”

Four hours later and still in extreme pain and bleeding, Carmen Vasquez says she went to the toilet of a school where she was working.

“When I was in the toilet, I hadn’t even sat when I felt something come down, and I fainted,” she tells Al Jazeera.

After regaining consciousness, Carmen Vasquez says she sat outside the toilet waiting for help, surrounded by her blood, unaware that she had already delivered her daughter and that the baby was stillborn.

Someone else who was in the school at the time had spotted the blood and flagged down a passing police patrol.

”They

by”Carmen

that I had killed my baby …. [But] I thought the baby was still inside [me]”]

When the police arrived, they did not give her the medical care or help she so desperately needed.

Instead, they handcuffed her.

“They told me they were arresting me for the crime of homicide,” she recalls.

“A female police officer pushed me and told me “you b***h, you are going to rot in jail.”

Carmen Vasquez, who was 24 years old at the time and pregnant with her second child, says that when the police arrested her, she was still losing blood and had little idea of what was going on.

“I did not hear anything. I never heard anything. I did not hear my baby cry,” she says.

“I was waiting for them to come to help me because I didn’t have any knowledge, there was a lot of blood, and that was [all I knew].”

Carmen Vasquezwas taken straight to jail.

“They … [said] that I had killed my baby …. [But] I thought the baby was still inside [me],” Carmen Vasquez says as she recalls a story still vivid in her memory.

She says she was taken to receive medical care after overhearing one police officer say: “The woman is going to die here, take her to hospital.”

When she woke up, she was surrounded by reporters who took her photo and filmed her, but “did not ask … anything”.

It was only months later that a judge found her guilty of aggravated homicide and sentenced her to 30 years in prison.

“When they told me that I was sentenced to 30 years, I felt that my whole world had come crashing down.” Carmen Vasquez says.

She was charged under a strict law in El Salvador that prohibits abortion in any circumstance.

Carmen Vasquez, her lawyers and supporters, including international human rights organisations, say she gave birth to a stillborn baby girl.

But the state accused her of aborting her child.

After 10 years in the squalid and overcrowded Ilopango prison, which houses nearly 10 times the number of people it is designed to hold, Carmen Vasquez hopes that conviction will soon be overturned.

San Salvador’s Second Court of Judgement is set to review her case next week.

One of her lawyers, Katia Recinos who works with the pro-choice group Citizens Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion, says she believes the review will lead to her client being freed.

Recinos tells Al Jazeera that the legal team was able to persuade the court to review the case because the “forensic investigation was not executed correctly”.

“[The Institute of] Legal Medicine established that the baby died due to perinatal asphyxia, but we were able to determine [that] the baby was dead before she was born,” Recinos says.

The lawyer explains that the “incomplete assessment” provided by the forensic doctors at the time combined with the fact that Carmen Vasquez had an ineffective legal team led to her conviction.

The General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of El Salvador was not available for comment.

El Salvador is one of only five countries where abortion iscriminalised in all cases.

Under the law, which was implemented in 1998, women can be charged with murder and other related charges for an abortion or suspected abortion carried out for any reason.

Additionally, medical professionals can face prosecution for not reporting a suspected abortion.

Rights groups say that this has created an environment of suspicion that often leads to women who have suffered miscarriages, stillbirths and other medical emergencies during pregnancy, being falsely accused of having an abortion.

“When a woman goes to the doctor because she has aborted naturally, the presumption of guilt automatically reigns instead of the presumption of innocence,” Alberto Brunori the representative for Central America at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), told local media in August.

Under the law, women can be charged with abortion or aggravated homicide.

If convicted of abortion, a woman faces two to eight years in prison. Those convicted of homicide are sentenced to 30 to 50 years.

According to Recinos, a woman is typically charged with an abortion if she is suspected to have ended her pregnancy within the first 12 weeks of gestation. She is charged with aggrevated homicide, however, if she is suspected to have ended the pregnancy after the first 12 weeks.

But she adds that the judge often decides the charge “solely based on the beliefs or gender biases that he has”.

The law has been justified by the country’s Catholic community and right-wing politicians.

Gregorio Chavez, the auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, told the BBC in 2015 that “all human life is sacred”.

He added: “Eliminating it is a murder and if there are two lives in danger, mother and child, we must save the life of the weakest, the son.”

At a 2016 plenary session on the topic of abortion in El Salvador’s Congress, Ricardo Velasquez Parker, of the opposition Alianza Republicana Nacionalista party (ARENA), declared: “If article one of our Constitution establishes that the person is recognised as a human being from the moment of conception, I do not need anybody to come to explain from a propagandist perspective that a … child to be born must pay for the broken dishes in … the unfortunate case of rape.”

“I would remind the deputies of all political forces that there is no Salvadoran that goes to church … that has principles and values that will see in a favourable light, in electoral matters, a deputy who votes in favour of decriminalising abortion,” Velasquez Parker said.

”They

by”Victor

do not understand that most of the time women do not have access to water, electricity and sanitary services. In these communities, many women do not even realise they are pregnant.”]

Recinos says that this sentiment is often echoed in the media.

“Many times, the media portrays them [the women] as murderers of their children,” she explains.

Victor Pena, a journalist who works for the Salvadoran website El Faro, says Catholic families control the two major newspapers in the country.

“Many times journalists have no choice but to follow that editorial line, fearing losing their jobs if they do otherwise,” Pena tells Al Jazeera.

“There is also rampant ignorance about how the lower classes live,” he adds.

“They [the upper-class] do not understand that most of the time women do not have access to water, electricity and sanitary services. In these communities, many women do not even realise they are pregnant.”

But public opinion may be changing.

A 2013 Amnesty International survey found that 74 percent of Salvadorans were in favour of abortion when the life of the woman is in danger.

Over the last couple of years, there have been several protests to support both sides of the debate.

At a demonstration against the strict abortion law in September, 50-year-old Santo Froiland told Al Jazeera that the “problem with El Salvador is that the legislation is made directly by men”.

“All the issues that are there are always favouring men in a macho style, putting aside all the rights women have,” he said.

While Carmen Vasquez’ sentence is one of the harshest, her story isnot the only one.

She is part of what is known as “Las 17” or “The 17” – a group of women who were convicted between 1999 and 2011 after losing their babies.

The women and their supporters say they suffered miscarriages, stillbirths or the child died shortly after birth.

The majority of Las 17 are like Carmen Vasquez: Young and poor.

According to the Federation of Feminist Organizations, a network of women’s groups in El Salvador, several of these women arrived at public health facilities bleeding and asking for help. But out of fear of being prosecuted themselves, medical staff contacted the police instead of providing care.

Rights groups say these women are guilty of nothing more than going into labour prematurely or experiencing gestational complications.

“In most cases, these are women without resources who suffer obstetric emergencies or spontaneous abortions [miscarriages] and, when they go to hospitals, they are reported by the medical staff, because they are afraid of prosecution,” Recinos explains.

I believe that my country hasn't treated me well at all, I didn't expect this, I didn't expect this from my country.

byCarmen Vasquez

Their imprisonment doesn’t just affect the women but also their families.

“Most of them are single mothers, their life partners are abroad,” Recinos says.

She adds that before being convicted, many of these women supported their families financially.

Once arrested, the woman’s family often struggles to pay the legal fees to support them in court.

Carmen Varquez’ family is still paying off the fees from her first lawyer 10 years ago.

In 2014, the Citizens Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion, supported by Amnesty International, petitioned the Supreme Court to free the 17 women.

Three – Maria Teresa Rivera, Carmen Guadalupe Vasquez Aldana and one woman identified as only Mirna – have had their convictions overturned.

For Carmen Vasquez and her family, they hope her upcoming day in court will bring the same news.

“The lawyers have done an excellent job, I hope that in this revision, we will be successful, and I can be there, outside, that’s what I wish the most,” she says.

But even if the conviction is overturned,Carmen Vasquez’ sisterCecilia fears for her life.

“I don’t want her to stay here,” Cecilia says.

“First of all, because of the discrimination that she will suffer from the family. Secondly, because the boys, the gang members, I’m scared for her,” she adds.

“She has not been around for 10 years now, once she comes back, they will try to investigate her, to know why was she in jail …. She could easily become a target of these criminal groups.”

Carmen Vasquez says if she is freed, leaving may be her best option.

“I would like to leave and never come back,” she says.

“Because believe me, I believe that my country hasn’t treated me well at all,” she adds.

“I didn’t expect this; I didn’t expect this from my country.”

Salvador Prison,UN rights office raises concerns about El Salvador gang crackdown,"The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has raised concerns aboutcurbs to civil libertiesand reports on the use of “excessive” force by police and military officers in El Salvador after a recent wave of gang violence.

In a statement on Tuesday, spokeswoman Liz Throssell said Salvadoran police and military forces deployed to gang strongholds undera state of emergencyhave resorted to “unnecessary and excessive use of force”.

She said “more than 5,747 people have been detained without an arrest warrant” since the state of emergency was adopted in late March, “and some have reportedly been subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”.

“Now, we recognise the challenges posed by gang violence in El Salvador and the State’s duty to ensure security and justice. However, it is imperative that this is done in compliance with international human rights law,” Throssell said.

El Salvador’s parliament approved a “state of exception” on March 27 in the aftermath of more than 80 weekend killings, which the government blamed on criminal gangs. Sixty-two people were killed in a single day – the highest, one-day tally in decades.

The state of emergency suspends certain civil liberties, including the right to association and the right to legal counsel, and prompted calls from civil society groups for President Nayib Bukele’s administration to ensure international human rights standards are met.

Bukele said this week that 6,000 suspected gang members had been arrested since the order came into force.

The two main criminal groups in the country, Mara Salvatrucha – more commonly referred to as MS-13 – and Barrio 18, have an estimated 70,000 members between them, and several thousand are already in Salvadoran prisons.

The president, who last week warned that gang membership leads to “prison or death“, on Monday also pledged to deny food in prison to gang members who take “revenge” on the population over his policies – a threat he repeated Tuesday.

Members of Bukele’s governing party last week pushed through substantial increases in prison sentences in response to the violence.

Under the new rules, convicted gang lords will now be sentenced to 40 to 45 years in jail, compared with six to nine years previously, while other gang members will be sentenced to 20 to 30 years, up from three to five years earlier.

In Tuesday’s statement, Throssell said the UN office was “deeply concerned about certain amendments to criminal law and criminal procedure” in El Salvador, including the imposition of higher sentences and the weakening of due process guarantees.

“Criminal trials can now be held in absentia, in the case of alleged gang members, or presided over by so-called ‘faceless’ judges, and that is, judges whose identity remains confidential, while the previous two-year limit to pre-trial detention has been eliminated,” she said.

Throssell also said teenagers associated with gangs who are found guilty of serious offences can now be sentenced as adults, and they can be forced to serve their sentences in adult prisons rather than juvenile detention centres.

“We remind El Salvador that the right to life, the right not to be subjected to torture, principles of fair trial and the presumption of innocence, as well as the procedural safeguards that protect these rights, apply at all times, even during states of emergency. This is especially with regard to children,” she said.

El Salvador registered 1,140 murders in 2021 – an average of 18 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants – a decline from the 1,341 registered the previous year and the lowest figure since the country’s civil war ended in 1992, according to official data.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/5/un-rights-office-raises-concerns-over-el-salvador-gang-crackdown,NEGATIVE,0.975145697593689
Salvador Prison,"El Salvador moves 2,000 alleged gang members to new ‘mega-prison’","The Central American nation of El Salvador has transferred 2,000 people accused of gang membership to a recently opened “mega-prison”. The transfer comes after a wave ofanti-gang operationsin which police swept up more than 64,000 people and key civil liberties were suspended.

In a Twitter post on Friday, PresidentNayib Bukelecelebrated the arrival of the alleged gang members at the prison, which has space for 40,000 people and is said to be the largest in the Americas.

“At dawn, in a single operation, we transferred the first 2,000 members to the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT),” said Bukele. “This will be their new house, where they will live for decades, all mixed, unable to do any further harm to the population.”

Bukele and his allies passed a controversial “state of exception” last year, suspending key rights such as the right to a lawyer and the right to private communication. The declaration also allowed police tomake arrestswithout a warrant and without explanation.

Human rights groups have criticised the measures, accusing the government of empowering itself toact with impunitywith little recourse for the wrongfully imprisoned. Dozens ofimprisoned people have diedduring the state of exception, which has been extended several times.

However, the crackdown has garnered widespread support from Salvadorans. Many credit the measures with curbing the criminal gangs that have inflicted campaigns of violence and exploitation on entire neighbourhoods for decades.

In a Februaryarticle, the Salvadoran paper El Faro, which has reported on the alleged abuses during the state of exception, said the government had dealt a serious blow to the gangs, even as itquestioned how durablethose changes would be.

“Critics of the state of exception admit, with nuance, that it has produced tangible results for the population,” the article reads. “But they focus the discussion on the future: How will these organizations mutate? How sustainable are the achievements of a policy of repression?”

Some critics also asked what would happen when those who had been arrested were eventually released from prison.

On Friday, Bukele and his allies seemed to offer a reply: They won’t be.

“We are eliminating this cancer from society,” justice and security minister Gustavo Villatoro said on Twitter. “Know that you will never walk out of CECOT, you will pay for what you are … cowardly terrorists.

The complex, located about 74 kilometres (46 miles) southeast of the capital San Salvador, is made up of eight buildings, each with 32 cells that hold more than 100 people apiece. A single cell, however, only has two sinks and one toilet.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador frees woman imprisoned over ‘stillbirth’,"A woman inEl Salvadorserving a 30-year prison term for allegedly aborting her child has been released after the country’s Supreme Court reduced her sentence.

Teodora del Carmen Vasquez was convicted in 2008 of aggravated homicide,after being charged under a strict abortion law prohibiting abortion or miscarriages.









Carmen Vasquez, her lawyers and human rights groups always maintained she had given birth to a stillborn baby girl after suffering health complications.

She spent more than 10 years in prison.

“My effort has been worth it and now I’m very happy to go back to my family again,” she said after leaving prison on Thursday, surrounded by relatives and activists.

Amnesty International called her release a positive step but stressed that Carmen Vasquez’ case should serve as an example and eventually end a ban that has resulted in the imprisonment of dozens of women.

“It’s encouraging to see Teodora stepping out of jail, where she should have never been in the first place, but El Salvador is still far from fully ensuring the rights of women and girls in the country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty’s Americas director.

Carmen Vasquez’s sentence was reportedly commuted by the Supreme Court and the justice ministry, but prosecutors maintain she strangled her baby.

“She is still guilty for the system, but she can be released due to a legal process we interposed, and at the same time an appeal against the 30 years sentence is in process,” said Katia Recinos, who works with the pro-choice group Citizens Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion.

“In March, we expect Maya Veronica, another woman jailed for abortion, to be released through the same legal process,” Recinos told Al Jazeera.

According to Amnesty,Carmen Vasquez’slawyers will seek compensation and redress for the time she spent behind bars.

Salvador Prison,Salvadoran rape survivor faces prison for giving birth in toilet,"Usulutan, El Salvador– The trial of a young Salvadoran woman, who became pregnant after being raped and suffered complications during her pregnancy, is set to begin on Monday in the latest case tried under the country’s strictabortionlaws.

Imelda Cortez, 20, is accused of attempted aggravated homicide of her newborn baby. She became pregnant at the age of 17 after being raped repeatedly by her stepfather.









Cortez, who said she was not aware she was pregnant at the time, suffered abdominal pains and went to the toilet where she fainted in April 2017. Her baby was found in the toilet.

The baby survived, but Cortez was sent to jail to await trial. She faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

Her stepfather has been charged with aggravatedsexual assaultof a minor and faces up to 15 years in prison, according to lawyers with theCitizen Group for the Depenalisation of Abortion.

Cortez’s lawyers had previously asked the judge to suspend the case due to lack of evidence of an attempted aggravated homicide. Medical reports from government institution Legal Medicine show that the young mother experienced a natural birth with no signs of having induced it herself. The baby did not show signs of aggression after birth, the institution reported.

A verdict in the case is expected sometime this week.

Cortez is one of the dozens of Salvadoran women accused of attempting to kill their babies in a country with a total abortion ban and some of the highest rates of disapproval of legalising abortion.

The Central American country criminalised abortion in all circumstances in 1998 when the country rewrote the penal code to remove previous exceptions that allowed abortion in some cases. Since then,El Salvadorhas put dozens of women behind bars for suspected abortions.

In the face of national and international pressure, El Salvador released some women imprisoned for suspected abortions earlier in the year.

This included Teodora Carmen Vasquez, who wasreleased in Februaryafter serving more than 10 years in prison for aggravated homicide in one of the most high-profile cases of women imprisoned for abortion in El Salvador.

Carmen Vasquez was convicted in 2008 for allegedly aborting her child and sentenced to 30 years in prison. She maintained she suffered a stillbirth afterhealthcomplications. Her sentence was reduced before her release.

Since Carmen Vasquez was allowed to walk free, at least four other women have been released.

“For us women who have been detained in a prison for late-term obstetric emergencies, I consider the system unjust because they have not investigated the things as they have happened,” Carmen Vasquez told Al Jazeera in September. “They’ve accused us of something that we’ve never done, just because we had these emergencies outside a hospital.”

Although Vasquez’s release marked a small step forward forwomen’s rights, recent shifts in the political makeup of the Salvadoran National Assembly worry rights advocates.

Despite lobbying by activists, a bill to depenalise abortion in cases of rape of a minor and risk to the life or health of mother failed to pass in April 2018.

In May 2018, newly elected representatives for the legislative assembly took their seats, with the right-wing ARENA party retaking control, leaving little possibility of passing a similar bill until the next election cycle.

The international community should be alert because sexual and reproductive rights often take a back seat when there are these steps backwards for human rights. The worst part is always lived by women.

bySara Garcia, Citizen Group for the Depenalisation of Abortion

Sara Garcia, an activist with the Citizen Group for the Depenalisation of Abortion, called the failed attempts a “step backwards for the assembly, for our democracy and for the human rights of women”.

She also called on the international community to “be alert because sexual and reproductive rights often take a back seat when there are these steps backwards for human rights. The worst part is always lived by women.”

Carmen Vasquez stands in solidarity with Cortez because they’ve gone through the same experience, with just one difference.

“Now, I’m free and she’s still going through this process,” she said. “They should investigate the cases well to serve justice as it should be.”

Salvador Prison,"Does Abrego Garcia have ‘MS-13’ tattooed on his knuckles, as Trump claims?","President Donald Trump repeatedly clashed with Terry Moran of ABC News about whetherKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was deported by the United States government to El Salvador in March disregarding a court order, had “MS13” – representing the MS-13 gang – tattooed on his knuckles.

During the ABC interview that aired on April 29, Trump referred to an image he shared on his Truth Social platform on April 18 showing what he said was Abrego Garcia’s tattoo.

The image shows a left hand with four tattoos, one on each finger: a marijuana leaf, a smiley face with the letter X for eyes, a cross, and a skull. It also displays an “M”, “S”, “1”, and a “3” in a printed font above these tattoos. The words describing the pictorial tattoos also appear below each one in a small, printed typeface.

Trump insisted Abrego Garcia’s hand says “MS13”, which Moran said was disputed and that some had said the tattoos were “interpreted that way”. The president said, “Don’t do that. M, S, one, three, it says M, S, one, three.”

Moran countered, “That was photoshopped.”

He tried to move on, but Trump continued. “Terry, do you want me to show you the picture?” Trump said. “He had M, S as clear as you can be. Not interpreted.”

After Moran again tried to shift to a question about Ukraine, Trump said Abrego Garcia has “got ‘MS13’ on his knuckles”.

The interview goes far beyond the impression Trump left when he shared an image on Truth Social of what he said were Abrego Garcia’s finger tattoos, as he insisted that the “MS13” tattoo was part of the evidence used to deport him.

When we asked the White House for comment, a spokesperson said any law enforcement or immigration official with on-the-ground experience could link Abrego Garcia’s tattoos to the MS-13 gang.

The letters and figures M, S, 1 and 3 and the words below the symbols do not appear in other recent photographs of Abrego Garcia’s hand, including one that Salvadoran government officials took when he met Senator Chris Van Hollen Jr on April 17. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele shared it on X.

The tattoos also do not appear in a family photo of Abrego Garcia shared by immigration advocates.

MS-13 experts told PolitiFact that none of the pictorial tattoos in the photograph is a known signifier of MS-13.

The Trump administrationdeported Abrego Garciaon March 15 to CECOT, a Salvadoran mega-prison where it has sent hundreds of Salvadoran and Venezuelan men who were previously in the US. But Abrego Garcia had a protection order that was supposed to prevent him from being deported to El Salvador. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyers acknowledged that they were aware of the restriction and, in court filings, called his removal an “oversight” and “an administrative error”.

The Trump administration has said Abrego Garcia and others deported to El Salvador were MS-13 gang members, which Abrego Garcia and lawyers have denied in court filings. All the men were deported without due process; the government did notpresent evidenceof their gang membership before a judge in the deportation case, and the migrants were not given the opportunity to defend themselves. The New York Times reported that most of the 238 men deported to El Salvador have neither criminal records in the US nor documented links to a Venezuelan prison gang.

When Abrego Garcia was arrested in March 2019, a police informant told police he was an MS-13 member, according to a report known as a “gang field interview sheet”. A judge initially ruled in 2019 that government evidence about Abrego Garcia’s gang membership was “trustworthy” and was upheld on appeal; later, two federal judges ruled that the government’s information was unsupported. It was based on clothing Abrego Garcia wore at the time of his 2019 arrest and information from what a since-fired police officer called a confidential source.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers say the MS-13 gang membership accusation was fabricated. They have sought to reverse his deportation, but the government has argued that since he left US jurisdiction, it cannot take action.

The US Supreme Court ruled that the government must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s release. Abrego Garcia has since been moved to a lower-security prison, according to news reports.







As for the pictorial tattoos on Abrego Garcia’s hand, marijuana leaves, crosses and skulls are widely used by people who do not belong to gangs. Gang crime experts said they did not stand out to them as MS-13 markers.

“I don’t believe a dangerous individual would have such anodyne and farcically generic tattoos on his hand,” said Liliana Castaneda Rossmann, a California State University San Marcos emerita professor of communication and author of the book Transcending Gangs: Latinas Story Their Experience.

Sean Kennedy, a former federal public defender in California and now a Loyola Law School professor, said in his experience representing and interacting with current and former MS-13 members, “The tattoos in the photo don’t look familiar to me.”

Such designs are out of character with typicalMS-13 tattoos, Kennedy said.

“Within MS-13 culture, such markings would likely be frowned upon and even viewed as a sign of cowardice, as they could be interpreted as an attempt to hide or downplay gang affiliation,” Kennedy said. “That type of concealment goes against the gang’s norms, which often demand bold, visible demonstrations of identity and loyalty.”

Charles Katz, director of Arizona State University’s Center for Violence Prevention and Community Safety, concurred.

While Katz said local law enforcement would be more familiar with specific tattoo designs in a given region, “I have worked on issues related to MS-13 for the past 15 years in El Salvador and the US, and I have never seen tattoos or graffiti suggesting that these particular tattoos are associated with MS-13.”

Experts said tattoos can be helpful in identifying gang members, as long as they are one of multiple pieces of evidence.

“While police gang experts often use so-called gang tattoos as circumstantial evidence of alleged gang involvement, in my experience, they never use tattoos alone as definitive evidence of gang affiliation,” said David M Kennedy, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor who studies gangs. “This is particularly true where, as here, the tattoos are ambiguous and may reflect things other than gang ties, such as religion, loss, personal transformation or cultural identity.”

Trump said Abrego Garcia “had ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles tattooed … He had MS as clear as you can be, not interpreted.”

The figures M, S, 1 and 3 and the words below the symbols do not appear in other photographs of Abrego Garcia’s hand, including one shared by the Salvadoran government.

Experts in MS-13 and other gangs say the pictorial tattoos shown are not typical designs for MS-13 or other gangs, and they say that several of those tattoos are commonly used by people unaffiliated with gangs.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador extends emergency powers in year-long gang crackdown,"Lawmakers in El Salvador have once again extended a state of emergency that suspends certain civil liberties as the government ofPresident Nayib Bukelecontinues its fight against gangs.

The so-called state of exception, renewed for a 12th time late on Wednesday by the Salvadoran Congress, came into effect last year and has led toaround 66,000 arrestsin the Central American nation.

It allows arrests without warrants, government access to private communications and detentions without the right to a lawyer.

“We ask that this regime be extended for more time,” Police Director Mauricio Arriaza told reporters ahead of this week’s 30-day extension.

“We need to keep fighting criminal groups, we need to give assurance to Salvadoran families, for their lives and their property.”

The text of the legislative decree stated that the “war against gangs conducted by the government has allowed the Salvadoran population to feel a sense of security”.

While the emergency measures enjoy widespread support in El Salvador, human rights groups and United Nations experts haveraised serious concernsaround violations of due process, arbitrary arrests and mistreatment of detainees.

Last month, rights groups and the Salvadoran police uniontold Al Jazeerathat a rising number of Salvadorans detained under the state of exception have been “re-arrested” upon release after either being granted bail or having their cases dropped.

That raised fresh fears that Bukele’s government plans to ensure that detainees remain behind bars, particularly inadvance of 2024 elections.

“From the beginning, we pointed out that it was not so crazy to think that the state of exception could extend until the elections,” Eduardo Escobar, a lawyer and director of Salvadoran NGO Citizen Action (Accion Ciudadana), told Al Jazeera at the time.

Bukele has said around 80 percent of El Salvador is under the control of criminal gangs, with the state of emergency introduced last year after a wave of murders attributed to the violent groups.

According to official figures, the crackdown has already led to 65,795 arrests, and 2,513 firearms have been seized.

In January, Humans Rights Watch denounced “severe prison overcrowding” in El Salvador’s jails as a result of the surge in detentions.

A month later, Bukele unveiled what he called thelargest prison in the Americas region, intended to hold 40,000 suspected gang members – more than doubling the country’s current total capacity of 30,000 inmates across 20 prisons.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/16/el-salvador-extends-emergency-powers-in-year-long-gang-crackdown,NEGATIVE,0.9846757054328918
Salvador Prison,Abortion ban: El Salvador frees women jailed after miscarriages,"Authorities in El Salvador have freed three women who spent between six and 13 years in jail under the country’sharsh anti-abortion lawsafter suffering miscarriages, a rights group has reported.

The women had lost their fetuses due to “health emergencies” during pregnancy, said the ACDATEE abortion rights group.

They were freed on Thursday, and reunited with their families for Christmas after their prison sentences for aggravated homicide were commuted. The freed women were identified only by their first names.

Karen had spent six years in prison, Kathy eight, and Evelyn 13, ACDATEE member Morena Herrera told the AFP news agency.

“It is a joy for all of us who have been fighting for the release of all women who have been unjustly imprisoned for suffering obstetric emergencies under this harsh and inhumane criminal law,” Herrera added.







El Salvadorbans abortion in all cases, and terminating a pregnancy can send a woman to jail for up to eight years. But judges often find women guilty of the crime of aggravated homicide instead, which can be punished by imprisonment of up to 50 years.

Many women are prosecuted after seeking medical help for complications in pregnancy, on suspicion of having attempted an abortion.

Fourteen other women remain in jail for similar reasons to Karen, Kathy and Evelyn, according to ACDATEE. “We continue fighting for the freedom of the rest of the women imprisoned,” said Herrera.

Campaigners are urging thegovernment of El Salvadorto legalise abortion when the woman’s life is at risk, the fetus is unviable, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.

But their efforts suffered a major setback in September, whenPresident Nayib Bukelescrapped a constitutional reform drafted by his government that would have opened the door to legalising medically necessary abortions.







Catholic andevangelicalanti-abortion groups often coordinate protests and social media campaigns against efforts to liberalise the country’s abortion ban. They argue the victims in these cases are the unborn fetuses, rather than the imprisoned women or their families.

The United Nations has repeatedly denouncedEl Salvador’scriminalisation of women suspected of abortion.

Some other countries in Latin America, however, have recently been relaxing hardline stanceson abortionin what women’s rights campaigners have dubbed the “green wave”.

After a decades-long fight bywomen’s rights advocates in Argentina, the country’s Senate in December legalised abortion, whileEcuador decriminalisedabortion in cases of rape in April.

The procedure is also legal in Uruguay, Cuba, as well as in Mexico City and three Mexican states.

In September,Mexico’s Supreme Court ruledthat criminalising abortion is unconstitutional.

El Salvador is one of a few countries in Latin America – along withNicaragua, Suriname, the Dominican Republic and Honduras – where abortion is not legal under any circumstance, according to the campaign group Global Doctors for Choice.

Salvador Prison,"Ecuador declares state of emergency, curfew after druglord escapes prison","Ecuador has declared a state of emergency after an “extremely dangerous” druglord escaped from maximum-security detention and unrest broke out at several prisons in the violence-plagued country.

President Daniel Noboa, in office since November, announced a 60-day mobilisation of soldiers in Ecuador’s streets and prisons as authorities searched for Jose Adolfo Macias, alias Fito.

There would also be a curfew from 11pm (04:00 GMT) to 5am (10:00 GMT) daily, the president said.

The state of emergency, Noboa said in a video on Instagram, would give members of the armed forces “all the political and legal support” they need to carry out their duties in a battle against what he described as “narcoterrorists”.

“We will not negotiate with terrorists nor rest until we return peace to all Ecuadorans,” Noboa said.

On Sunday, Fito, the leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, was found missing by police conducting an inspection of a prison in the port city of Guayaquil.

The 44-year-old, who is said to have instilled terror in his fellow inmates, is believed to have escaped just hours before police arrived, according to presidency spokesperson Roberto Izurieta. He was apparently tipped off.

“The full force of the state is being deployed to find this extremely dangerous individual,” Izurieta told domestic television on Monday.

He said the prison system had failed and bemoaned “the level of infiltration” by criminal groups.

The prosecutor’s office, meanwhile, said it had opened an investigation and filed charges against two prison officials “allegedly involved in the escape” of Fito.







Fito had been serving a 34-year sentence for organised crime, drug trafficking and murder since 2011.

This is his second prison escape – the last was in 2013 when he was recaptured after three months.

In an operation involving thousands of security forces, Fito was transferred to a maximum-security prison last August following theassassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio.

A week before his death, anti-cartel candidate Villavicencio said he had received threats from Fito.

Long a peaceful haven between top cocaine exporters Colombia and Peru, Ecuador has seenviolenceexplode in recent years as rival gangs with links to Mexican and Colombian cartels vie for control.

Gang wars largely play out in the country’s prisons, where criminal leaders such as Fito wield immense control.

Some 460 inmates have been killed in these battles since 2021, and their bodies are often found dismembered, decapitated or incinerated.

Izurieta said Fito, who studied law in prison, was a “criminal with extremely dangerous characteristics, whose activities have characteristics of terrorism”.

“The search continues … He will be found, he must be found,” said the spokesperson.

After Fito’s escape, unrest broke out at penitentiaries in six of Ecuador’s 24 provinces on Monday, according to the SNAI prison authority, with guards taken hostage at some of the facilities.

Heavily armed police and soldiers entered the prisons of El Oro, Loja, Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, Azuay and Pichincha, after which the military distributed images of half-naked inmates rounded up in courtyards.

The SNAI said there had been no injuries due to the “incidents”.

Other videos on social media, not verified by the authorities, purported to show hooded inmates threatening officials with knives as they pleaded for their lives.

Noboa came to powerwith promises to clamp down on gangs and insecurity.

On the campaign trail, he proposed creating a separate judicial system for the most serious crimes, militarising the borders with Colombia and Peru, and jailing the most violent offenders on barges offshore.

Last week, he announced the construction of two new maximum-security prisons similar to those built by El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, who has led acontroversial crackdown on gangscredited with drastically reducing his country’s murder rate.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/ecuador-declares-state-of-emergency-curfew-after-druglord-escapes-prison,NEGATIVE,0.8322051763534546
Salvador Prison,El Salvador electoral body wants observers deployed early,"The highest electoral body in El Salvador is calling for international election observers to be deployed early in the Central American country, after a deadly shooting in the middle of campaigning over the weekend.

The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) on Tuesday urged the United Nations, European Union and Organization of American States (OAS) to expedite their observer missions after a shooting in San Salvador on Sunday killed two political activists and wounded five others.

Officials said an assailant opened fire on members of the country’s left-wing FMLN party in one of the worst political attacks in decades.

In a statement, the TSE asked the international bodies “to advance their observer missions to the country in order to monitor, prevent and denounce any act of political violence”.

The observers were meant to arrive a week before legislative and local polls on February 28.







The shooting took place days after President Nayib Bukele criticised the peace deal signed between the army and the FMLN to end a civil war in 1992.

“All those responsible will pay for their actions,” Bukele tweeted after the incident.

Two government employees and a private security guard have been arrested in the case.

No group has taken responsibility for the shooting, which drew condemnation from the head of the OAS, Luis Almagro.

Almagro called on the country’s attorney general to “investigate and prosecute” those responsible.

In its statement, the election tribunal said it wished to prevent any actions that could “tarnish” the election, also citing recent death threats levelled against judges.

It also urged supporters of rival parties to “respect” one another and ensure a peaceful poll.

Approximately 5.4 million Salvadorians will vote for 84 national lawmakers and 262 local representatives from 10 political groups later this month. President Bukele’s New Ideas (NI) party currently leads in the polls.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador frees three women convicted for suspected abortions,"Ilopango, El Salvador– Alba Lorena Rodriguez embraced her 11- and 14-year-old daughters as a free woman for the first time in nearly a decade on Thursday.

Since 2010, Rodriguez has been behind bars for an abortion-related conviction inEl Salvador, a country with one of the harshestabortionbans in the world.









During that time, the 39-year-old mother has only been able to see her daughters on designated family visit days every 15 days, sometimes seeing them less frequently when the family did not have enough money to travel to the Ilopango women’s prison on the outskirts of San Salvador.

Rodriguez’s mother-in-law and daughters were excited and anxious as they made the trip one last time.

“I’m going to hug her,” saidGloriaRivas, Rodriguez’smother-in-law, as she waited outside for her daughter.

On Thursday, Rodriguez was released from prison after the supreme court commuted her 30-year sentence.

Two other women sentenced for suspected abortions – Maria del Transito Orellana, and Cinthia Marcela Rodriguez – were also released in the latest win forwomen’s rightsactivists fighting to loosen the country’s strict abortion laws.

Since the Central American nation banned abortion under all circumstances in 1998, dozens of women have been sentenced to up to 30 years for abortion-related crimes. Those convicted are mainly from poorer communities and have limited resources to pay for a lawyer to defend them in court, as was the case for the three women released on Thursday.

The women say they had a miscarriage or obstetric emergency in the second or third trimester of their pregnancy, according to lawyers. The state accused them of aggravated homicide and sentenced them to 30 years.

Lawyers representing the women have insisted that they have been wrongfully imprisoned and convicted without evidence.

Both Rodriguez and del Transito Orellana already had children at the time of their conviction.

Separating mothers from their children under the abortion law shows the hypocrisy of the ban because the state imposes maternity on women but also unjustly separates them from their children, according to Morena Herrera, director of the Citizen’s Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion.

The court recently decided the women’s sentences were “disproportionate and immoral given that the economic support of these women for their families is fundamental”.

The three women are members of “Las 17”, a group of women imprisoned for abortion who were identified by activists in 2013 as part of a campaign to demand their release.

Their efforts have started to pay off. In 2018 and 2019, 13 women have been freed, including Teodora del Carmen Vasquez, 35,who was releasedin February 2018 after a decade behind bars for an abortion-related crime.

“We have been victims of a justice system that is very judgmental. We also know that the women inside have experienced the same,” del Carmen Vasquez said outside the prison on Thursday. “Our responsibility as women who have been released is to stand up and demand that the Salvadoran state release all the women.”

Efforts to decriminalise abortion through the country’s legislative assembly have been unsuccessful.

In 2018, two legislators proposed bills to legalise abortion under certain circumstances in the Salvadoran assembly. But the proposals never came to a vote. In May 2018, new officials took office and the country’s right-wing party gained the upper hand in the legislature, squashing the possibility of approving either law.

On February 3, El Salvador electedNayib Bukele, former mayor of San Salvador and candidate for centre-right party GANA, as president. In a November 2018 debate, Bukele said he was only in favour of legalising abortion in cases where the pregnancy is a threat to the life of the mother.

“But let’s not assume the presumption of guilt of a poor woman who had a [miscarriage or obstetric emergency],” he said at the time.

With abortion still criminalised, activists and lawyers have been forced to argue for the freedom of each woman on a case-by-case basis. Lawyers have identified 18 incidents of women currently imprisoned in abortion-related cases in El Salvador.

They believe their “strategic litigation” has established an important legal precedent to increase equal access to justice in the country – and that it will lead to the eventual release of all the women imprisoned in relation to the country’s total abortion ban, according to a recent press release.

“This doesn’t end here,” said Vasquez. “There is still more to do.”

“What do we want for ‘Las 17’ and more?” activists chanted outside the prison minutes before Rodriguez finally walked free. “Freedom.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/3/7/el-salvador-frees-three-women-convicted-for-suspected-abortions,POSITIVE,0.9884733557701111
Salvador Prison,Gang violence leaves 14 prisoners dead in El Salvador,"At least 14 inmates have been killed in an El Salvador jail after violence erupted between two factions of anotorious gang, an official has said.









The killings on Saturday at Quezaltepeque prison, about 30km north of the capital San Salvador, were linked to an internal dispute involving the Barrio 18 (M-18) gang, a spokesman for the presidency told the AFP news agency.









The prison was placed on lockdown and security ramped up, as about 50 people with relatives in the jail descended on the facility, some weeping and others demanding to know the identities of the dead.

A state of emergency was declared for 72 hours at the jail and authorities insisted that they were in full control of the situation.

Prison officials were alerted when some members of the ‘Revolutionaries’ faction of the gang failed to return to their cells, said Eugenio Chicas, the communications secretary for the presidency.

Security agents and riot police found their bodies among some rubbish bins, added Chicas, labelling it “a purge”.

“There has been an internal confrontation,” said Chicas.

The Directorate General of Prisons, on Twitter, said it was “presumed to be an act of purification among gang members”.

Rising murder rate

The deaths underline how gang violence has made El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries in the world.

These are worrisome numbers. These are Salvadorans who are dying. Regardless of who is a gang member or not

byMauricio Ramirez, national police chief

On Wednesday, police said there were at least 125 murders in just three days in the country, a staggering toll even by El Salvador’s standards.

“These are worrisome numbers. These are Salvadorans who are dying. Regardless of who is a gang member or not,” Mauricio Ramirez, the national police chief, told reporters.

There were 3,332 murders between January and June, up from 2,191 a year earlier, government data shows.

The Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and M-18 gangs have an estimated 70,000 members in El Salvador, 10,000 of whom are behind bars.

The gangs emerged in the 1980s in Latino neighbourhoods in Los Angeles.

They arrived in Central America when the US deported thousands of immigrants who had fled there to escape civil wars that had gripped the region in the late 20th century.

Negotiations

Criminal gangs have been pressuring the government to include them in a commission examining ways to stem endemic urban violence for which these same groups are, to a large extent, responsible.









Since taking office last year, President Salvador Sanchez Ceren has tried to crack down on crime and refused to negotiate with the gangs.

Last month, M-18 ordered a bus strike and seven bus drivers were killed after they defied the gang.

By seeking to shut down public transport, the gang hoped to strong-arm the government to the negotiating table.

The ongoing violence underscores the breakdown in a truce the gangs declared in March 2012, brokered by the Catholic church with behind-the-scenes help from then president Mauricio Funes.

In response to the new wave of violence, Sanchez Ceren has reversed a key concession of the controversial truce, ordering more than 50 jailed gang leaders who were being held in “flexible” detention centres transferred back to maximum-security prisons.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/8/23/gang-violence-leaves-14-prisoners-dead-in-el-salvador,NEGATIVE,0.9884225726127625
Salvador Prison,El Salvador: Jailed ex-president gets two more years for bribery,"Elias Antonio Saca, the former president ofEl Salvadorwho is serving a 10-year prison term for corruption, has been sentenced to another two years forbribery.

Saca was found guilty of having offered $10,000 to a court employee to obtain information about a case against him, the attorney general’s office said on Thursday.









A court spokesman told AFP news agency Saca was sentenced “during an abbreviated trial”.

The former leader “negotiated” an abbreviated trial with prosecutors, agreeing to confess to a bribery offence in exchange for a shorter period in prison, the official said.

A judge will decide whether Saca will serve an extra two years, or if the additional time will be considered as part of his existing ten-year sentence.

Saca, president from 2004 to 2009, was sentenced in September last year after confessing to diverting $301m of public funds during his tenure.

Five years of the sentence were for money laundering, and five for embezzlement. He also has to give back $260m to the state.

During the trial, prosecutors said Saca had appropriated public funds for himself and others, including taking more than $7m for his former party, the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance.

The 54-year-old former businessman was detained in October 2016 during his son’s wedding.

Salvador Prison,Human rights crisis in El Salvador ‘deepening’: Amnesty,"As El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele embarks on his second term in office, an international rights group has warned that his war on gangs has created a spiralling human rights crisis.

As of February 2024, Bukele’s draconian two-yearcampaign, which has seen the authorities detain about 78,000 people, has caused 235 deaths in state custody, said Amnesty International on Wednesday. Citing a local rights group, it also reported 327 cases of enforced disappearances.

“Reducing gang violence by replacing it with state violence cannot be a success,” said Amnesty’s Americas director Ana Piquer in a statement. The Salvadoran government had adopted “disproportionate measures”, she said, denying, minimising and concealing human rights violations.

Bukele launched his war on gangs in March 2022, slashing homicides to the lowest rate in three decades after imposing astate of emergencythat suspended the need for arrest warrants and the right to a fair trial, among other civil liberties.Prisonovercrowding currently stands at 148 percent, according to Amnesty.







After Bukele consolidated power in alandslide winin February’s election, the rights group warned the situation looks set to worsen. “If this course is not corrected, the instrumentalization of the criminal process and the establishment of a policy of torture in the prison system could persist,” it said.

On Tuesday, Minister of Justice and Security Gustavo Villatoro pledged there would be no let-up in the government’s campaign against the gangs, and promised to “eradicate this endemic evil”.

“This war against these terrorists will continue,” he said on state television.

Piquer said that Bukele had created a “false illusion” that he had found “the magic formula to solve the very complex problems of violence and criminality in a seemingly simple way”. She described the international community’s response as “timid”.

“The international community must respond in a robust, articulate and forceful manner, condemning any model of public security that is based on human rights violations,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/27/human-rights-crisis-in-el-salvador-deepening-amnesty,NEGATIVE,0.9779662489891052
Salvador Prison,El Salvador upholds 30-year sentence in stillbirth case,"A court inEl Salvadorhas upheld the 30-year prison sentence of a woman who was charged with homicide under the country’s strict abortion law after she says she suffered a stillbirth.

Teodora del Carmen Vasquez was seeking to have her conviction overturned after spending nearly a decade in jail after she says gave birth to her stillborn daughter in 2007.









A court on Thursday, however, rejected her appeal and upheld the sentence.

Carmen Vasquez, whospoke to Al Jazeeraearlier this year while awaiting the court date, said she did not know she had delivered her child when the police showed up to her workplace, handcuffed her and took her jail.

“I never realised I had my baby, I was waiting for help, I didn’t even know I was losing so much blood,” she told Al Jazeera.

“When police arrived, they told me they had to arrest me because I had killed my baby, this never happened,” she said.

The state accused her of aborting her child, while her lawyers and supporters say she delivered the baby stillborn.

El Salvador is one of only five countries to criminalise abortion in all circumstances.









Under the law, a woman can be accused of abortion or homicide, even in cases of rape or when the woman’s health is at risk.

The law also penalises health providers who do not report suspected abortions, which rights groups have said creates an environment in which women who suffer miscarriages early in pregnancy or stillbirths are often reported to police.

A woman can be punished with a sentence of up to eight years for an abortion, and in some cases up to 50 years if a judge determines “homicide” was committed.

Katia Recinos, one of Carmen Vasquez’s lawyers, told Al Jazeera before the court ruling that she was hopeful based on new evidence that her client’s case would be overturned.

The lawyer argued that the initial forensic investigation after the incident was “incomplete” and new evidence found that the baby died before it was born.

But on Thursday, the court concluded that there were no irregularities in the forensic evidence, according to local media.

Human rights groups condemned the court’s decision, calling it an “outrageous step backward for justice”.

“Teodora’s tragic story is a sad illustration of everything that is wrong with the justice system in El Salvador, where human rights seem to be a foreign concept,” Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, said in a statement.

“Instead of punishing Teodora for being a woman, authorities in El Salvador must urgently take a hard look at their outrageous anti-abortion law and take immediate steps to repeal it,” she added.

Other groups, includingHuman Rights Watch, have called on El Salvador to decriminalise abortion, saying the current law “poses risks to women’s life and health”.

Earlier this year, a bill was introduced that would change the law to allow abortion in some circumstances, such as rape or when a woman’s health is at risk.

The proposed legislation remains in committee.

Last summer, a group of UN experts also urged the country to “allow the termination of pregnancy in specific circumstances”.

According to El Salvador-based Alliance for Women’s Health and Life, there were at least 147 cases between 2000 and 2014 in which a woman was charged under the abortion law.

Earlier this year, a 19-year-old rape survivor wassentenced to 30 yearsin prison after she suffered a stillbirth due to complications during her pregnancy.

Carmen Vasquez is also part of a group known as “Las 17” or “The 17”, which comprises women who were convicted between 1999 and 2011 after losing their babies.

Three of the women have had their convictions overturned after the Citizens Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion – a pro-choice organisation – along with Amnesty International petitioned the Supreme Court to free all 17 of the women.

For Carmen Vasquez, it remains unclear what her next steps will be.

According to local media, her lawyers are still evaluating if there is another legal process they can take.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador Supreme Court orders state of emergency suspended,"El Salvador’s Supreme Court said on Monday that it had ordered the immediate suspension of the state of emergency declared by President Nayib Bukele over the coronavirus.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Saturday night declared a state of emergency to extend coronavirus measures without approval by congress, touching off a torrent of criticism that the move had been unconstitutional.

Salvadoran legislators and prosecutors said Bukele’s Saturday announcement had overstepped his powers.

Less than a year into his administration, Bukele, a brash 38-year-old leader, has repeatedly angered rights groups, who say he has shown authoritarian tendencies. In February, Bukele and a group of soldiers armed with automatic weapons briefly occupied congress. Last month, he released startling photos of hundreds of jailed gang members stripped to underwear and pressed together in formation, horrifying advocates.

Congress approved an emergency declaration in March to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, but after an extension in April, the measure was due to expire on Sunday. Legislators planned to discuss an extension when they reconvened on Monday.

Shortly after Bukele issued his decree on Saturday, the Salvadoran attorney general said in a statement that it would file a suit alleging that the move was unconstitutional with the country’s top court. But Bukele, who swept to the presidency last year with an outsider candidacy, maintained he was well within his rights.

“All presidents in the democratic history of our country have had the power to declare a state of emergency and have exercised it, without legislative approval,” he wrote in a post on Twitter on Sunday. “Will a president be prevented for the first time from exercising that vital power?”

Bukele’s administration maintains that a civil protection law authorises the president to declare a state of emergency if congress cannot hold a session.

They contend that the risk of the coronavirus spreading further in El Salvador justifies the measures. The country has 1,413 confirmed cases of the virus and 30 deaths. Health experts say the country’s health system is not equipped to handle a surge in cases.

Legislators and civil society groups urged an investigation to determine whether Bukele had exceeded his powers.

“What would an autocrat do if Congress did not pass a law on his behalf? I would issue a decree. This has just been done by the young Salvadoran leader (Nayib Bukele) with the state of emergency. Another serious setback,” Jose Vivanco, executive director for the Americas for US-based Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter.

In recent days, Salvadorans in the capital have protested measures taken during the quarantine, which they say have led to job losses and hunger. To avoid breaking social distancing rules, they voice their discontent by banging pots, honking the horns of their vehicles and playing loud music.

Fabricio Benitez, a 26-year-old musician who lives with his parents and sister on the outskirts of San Salvador, said that his father, a soil engineer, lost his job a month ago after his company’s operations were affected by the pandemic.

Salvador Prison,Combating El Salvador’s gangs,"El Salvador’s government has stepped up its crackdown on gangs, or maras, as they are called.



Elite police units, armed and trained by US special police, have been attacking the two most violent gangs in Central America: the Mara Salvatrucha and the 18th Street.



Youth crackdown



Years into the crackdown, young men are familiar with the drill. They are deemd as suspects by having a gang’s tattoos or simply for being young and male.



Alcides Enrique Grandos, an officer with the UTO (Operative Tactical Unit), said:“If they look more than 14 and 18-years old, we will stop them.”



The police’s way of cleaning up the streets is to lock gang members up, by the thousand.



But every night, police find at least eight bodies disposed of in bushes or left on San Salvador’s streets.









Authorities say the gangs are fuelling the wave of violent crimes that has swept across the region.



Officials say the hard-line approach is the way to combat gang violence. But years into it El Salvador is still one of the most violent countries in Latin America.



The streets are empty at night and people fear for their lives.



Elite units aim to strike at the heart of the gangs. Rapid response teams, backed by military patrols, target gang territory but the violence has not abated.



The government reported almost 4,000 murders in 2006.



‘Harder’ response



Rodrigo Avila, the head of police, wants to hit the gangs harder.



He said: “We know we have to improve a lot but if you talk to the people, people really think that the law is not being enforced, that the law is not strong enough.”



The government’s hard-line approach has sent thousands of gang members to prison.



The cycle of violence is reminiscent of the 80’s, when El Salvador was plunged into a 12 year civil war that killed at least 70,000 people.



The war indirectly gave birth to the gangs. Thousands of Salvadoran refugees fled to the US and there the gangs were founded.









Alex Sanchez arrived in the US when he was just seven.



He says he felt isolated and vulnerable in a Los Angeles where gangs reigned and he did not feel that he belonged.



He became one of the founders of the Mara Salvatrucha.



Sanchez said: “When they killed one of the guys from one of the cliques … it brought everybody into a whole different view of what they were involved in.



“It wasn’t about the one on one fights, or the rumbles in the schools or in the parks. That was about a life, or taking somebody’s life. And we had one taken.”



Thousands of gang members were arrested in the US as part of Operation Community Shield, which was launched in 2005.



The US policy of deporting convicted gang members means that thousands have been sent back to El Salvador and a generation of Salvadoran gang members who grew up in the US are now on the streets of San Salvador.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2007/2/7/combating-el-salvadors-gangs,POSITIVE,0.9665538668632507
Salvador Prison,Trying to end gang bloodshed in El Salvador,"San Salvador, El Salvador –A tiny Central American country blessed with spectacular natural beauty, El Salvador is now the most dangerous country in the world not engulfed in an ongoing war. Last year, there were 3,942 murders – nearly 11 each day, 57 percent more than in 2013 – a staggering killing rate in a country of only 6.1 million people.

An ambitious five-year plan to curb the shocking violence in El Salvador through prevention and social programmes was announced last Thursday, raising genuine hopes of ending the daily horrors after more than a decade of disastrousMano Dura– Iron Fist – policies.









The $2bn‘Safe El Salvador’ planpromises parks, sports facilities, education and training programmes for the country’s 50 most violent municipalities, as well as improvements to the worst prisons where the country’s biggest gangs – Mara Salvatrucha 13 (MS13) and Calle 18 – have proliferated over the past decade.

How the 124-point action plan presented by the Council on Citizen Security will be funded is unclear. But, the prevention-focused proposal appears to be the most comprehensive yet to reduce violence since the 1992 peace accords, which ended the bloody 12-year civil war.

”I

by”-

a great march for peace, justice and in the fight against insecurity, to show and prove to the world that we want and we can build a productive, educated and safe El Salvador.”]



There were fears that President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, a leftist guerrilla commander in the civil war, would bow to public pressure to impose yet another crackdown on the gangs, accused of causing most of the bloodshed. The most recent spike in murders is blamed on thebreakdown of a two-year ‘truce’ between MS13 and Calle 18.

“The heavy-handed Mano Dura and Zero Tolerance policies have not reduced crime or improved public safety,” said Jeanne Rikkers, violence prevention analyst from the human rights organisation Fespad.

“To see a comprehensive, well-founded security policy with 75 percent of funds allocated to prevention coming from a coalition of mainly conservative groups – which have long resisted a balanced integrated approach to tackling the violence – is incredible.”

Spiralling violence, temporary truce

The scale of the violence is mind-blowing.

In December, 412 people were murdered – double the number killed in December 2013. This particularly bloody month pushed up the2014 murder rate to 68.6 per 100,000 people, slightly higher than neighbour Honduras.

Yet the conviction rate is only five percent. The criminal justice system – from police to prosecutors and courts – ishampered by endemic corruption, inefficiency and lack of resources.

MS13 and Calle 18 originated as street gangs in eastern Los Angeles, but have become transnational organisations boasting tens of thousands of members and diverse criminal activities across the region.

“The transformation of the gangs is mainly down to Mano Dura and Zero Tolerance policies, which jailed massive numbers of young men who became determined to take revenge on the authorities,” said Jose Miguel Cruz, gang researcher and regional director of Latin America and Caribbean Centre at Florida International University.

The spiralling violence was temporarily reduced after a secretly negotiated truce in 2012 by the Catholic Church and senior officials from the previous government.

It appeared to work like the “interrupters” programmes introduced in some US cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, where authorities identified key jailed gang leaders who could de-escalate potentially bloody situations by communicating with members on the outside, Steven Dudley, co-director of InSight Crime, told Al Jazeera.

The truce provided the first quasi-empirical glimpse into how many killings were in fact down to the two main gangs.

The murder rate halved almost instantly, and there was a palpable change in atmosphere in some communities, as previously terrified families began venturing out into parks and squares after dark for the first time in years.

However, the gangs were then, and still are, loathed by the majority of Salvadorans and vilified by much of the media, withwidespread opposition to negotiations.

It wasn’t clear what the gangs hadnegotiated in return for killing fewer people, but there was a public outcry when journalists exposed the transfer of violent gang leaders to low security prisons. They were also accused of taking advantage of the truce to boost extortion rackets and the drug trade.

Cruz opposed the 2012 truce because it was done without follow-up prevention and rehabilitation programmes to tackle root causes such as poverty, police brutality, corruption, education, and overcrowded prisons, without which he doesn’t believe pacification is possible.

“There is no way of resolving the violence in El Salvador and northern triangle of Central America without talking with the gangs, but only as part of a broad strategy which includes prevention, rehabilitation, demobilisation and disarmament. There can never be peace without addressing the deep corruption in the criminal justice system,” Cruz said.

It started crumbling at the end of 2013 in the run-up to the presidential elections, when the outgoing FMLN (Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front) government appeared to withdraw its support. Negotiators were pulled out from prisons and a crackdown on mobile phones hindered communication between jailed leaders and foot soldiers –not all of which had been about promoting peace.

New president – new plan

By mid-2014, homicides were back up to pre-truce levels with 14 murders a day in May – the month beforeSanchez Ceren took officeas the country’s second left-wing leader.

He remained vague on the gang issue before and after the election, but appointed religious and business leaders, and politicians from both main political parties to his new Council for Citizen Security.

Their action plan was revealed in front of a striking portrait of El Salvador’s most revered martyr, Archbishop Oscar Romero, whose assassination in March 1980 by a military death squad tipped the country into full-scale civil war, which left 80,000 people dead.

Sanchez Ceren invoked memories of the war and subsequent peace accords – which he co-signed in Mexico on January 16, 1992 – as he called on the country to unite to resolve the violence.

“I call the entire population to [attend] a great march for peace, justice and in the fight against insecurity, to show and prove to the world that we want and we can build a productive, educated and safe El Salvador,” he said.

The Council’s progressive plan and president’s conciliatory speech came as somewhat of a surprise. In December, the Council persuaded the government to hire former “tough-on-crime” New York City mayorRudy Giuliani as a consultant.

Earlier this month, Sanchez Ceren raised further fears of yet another hard-line policy when he unequivocally ruled out negotiating with the gangs. He said the government was obliged to “go after them [and] punish them”.

Sanchez Ceren’s contradictory messages could well be part of a delicate political dance, as legislative assembly and local mayoral elections take place in March.

During mayoral elections three years ago, the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance Part unexpectedly won several FMLN strongholds after the gangs openly said they wanted to punish the government for rejecting dialogue and continued police oppression.

However, the elections also give the gangs, and other criminal groups, an opportunity to use violence to leverage power and force a seat at the negotiating table.

Fifteen people a day were killed in the first 11 days of January, including several police officers.

There is no sign of the carnage letting up. Meanwhile, the government must find the money to start implementing the plan, appease the gangs, and fight elections.

“It does not seem logical to rule out dialogue, but it is not politically palatable when opinion polls show most people are against it,”Dudley said. “The problem is gangs have leverage vis-a-vis violence, and measuring the truce in homicides has set a dark and dangerous precedent which needs to be broken.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/1/19/trying-to-end-gang-bloodshed-in-el-salvador,POSITIVE,0.9985824823379517
Salvador Prison,El Salvador frees woman jailed for murder after a miscarriage,"Authorities in El Salvador have freed a woman who had been jailed on charges of killing her baby after suffering a miscarriage, according to a local rights group.

The 38-year-old woman was freed on Wednesday.

She has already served 10 years of her 30-year sentence.

The Citizen Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion in El Salvador said the woman, Elsy, was arrested in June 2011 after reporting an “obstetric emergency”.

She was then accused of aborting her pregnancy and charged with aggravated homicide.

In El Salvador, abortion under any circumstances is outlawed, including in cases of rape and incest and even when the woman’s health is in danger.

The Citizen Group released a photo that it said depicted Elsy after her release from jail and said her original court case was full of irregularities and without a presumption of innocence.

“We celebrate Elsy’s release after 10 years,” said the group’s president, Morena Herrera. “Her erroneous 30-year sentence for aggravated homicide is over. We must continue to fight tirelessly to free those who remain deprived of liberty.”

Elsy is among 17 women whose freedom the rights group is trying to win.

Last December, as part of a campaign called “Free the 17”, celebrities including America Ferrera, Milla Jovovich and Kathryn Hahn called on Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to free the women.

Since the launch of the campaign,five of those womenhave been freed. The figure includes Elsy.

The Citizen Group said Elsy’s jailing separated her from her son, who only had her.

Now, more than 10 years later, “she will be able to reunite with him and her family”, it added.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has also condemned El Salvador’s strict anti-abortion laws.

In November, the court ordered the Central American country to reform its abortion laws following thedeath of a womanwho was sent to prison for breaching those laws.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/10/el-salvador-frees-woman-jailed-for-murder-after-a-miscarriage,NEGATIVE,0.9835404753684998
Salvador Prison,El Salvador upholds 30-year sentence in stillbirth case,"A court inEl Salvadorhas upheld the 30-year prison sentence of a woman who was charged with homicide under the country’s strict abortion law after she says she suffered a stillbirth.

Teodora del Carmen Vasquez was seeking to have her conviction overturned after spending nearly a decade in jail after she says gave birth to her stillborn daughter in 2007.









A court on Thursday, however, rejected her appeal and upheld the sentence.

Carmen Vasquez, whospoke to Al Jazeeraearlier this year while awaiting the court date, said she did not know she had delivered her child when the police showed up to her workplace, handcuffed her and took her jail.

“I never realised I had my baby, I was waiting for help, I didn’t even know I was losing so much blood,” she told Al Jazeera.

“When police arrived, they told me they had to arrest me because I had killed my baby, this never happened,” she said.

The state accused her of aborting her child, while her lawyers and supporters say she delivered the baby stillborn.

El Salvador is one of only five countries to criminalise abortion in all circumstances.









Under the law, a woman can be accused of abortion or homicide, even in cases of rape or when the woman’s health is at risk.

The law also penalises health providers who do not report suspected abortions, which rights groups have said creates an environment in which women who suffer miscarriages early in pregnancy or stillbirths are often reported to police.

A woman can be punished with a sentence of up to eight years for an abortion, and in some cases up to 50 years if a judge determines “homicide” was committed.

Katia Recinos, one of Carmen Vasquez’s lawyers, told Al Jazeera before the court ruling that she was hopeful based on new evidence that her client’s case would be overturned.

The lawyer argued that the initial forensic investigation after the incident was “incomplete” and new evidence found that the baby died before it was born.

But on Thursday, the court concluded that there were no irregularities in the forensic evidence, according to local media.

Human rights groups condemned the court’s decision, calling it an “outrageous step backward for justice”.

“Teodora’s tragic story is a sad illustration of everything that is wrong with the justice system in El Salvador, where human rights seem to be a foreign concept,” Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, said in a statement.

“Instead of punishing Teodora for being a woman, authorities in El Salvador must urgently take a hard look at their outrageous anti-abortion law and take immediate steps to repeal it,” she added.

Other groups, includingHuman Rights Watch, have called on El Salvador to decriminalise abortion, saying the current law “poses risks to women’s life and health”.

Earlier this year, a bill was introduced that would change the law to allow abortion in some circumstances, such as rape or when a woman’s health is at risk.

The proposed legislation remains in committee.

Last summer, a group of UN experts also urged the country to “allow the termination of pregnancy in specific circumstances”.

According to El Salvador-based Alliance for Women’s Health and Life, there were at least 147 cases between 2000 and 2014 in which a woman was charged under the abortion law.

Earlier this year, a 19-year-old rape survivor wassentenced to 30 yearsin prison after she suffered a stillbirth due to complications during her pregnancy.

Carmen Vasquez is also part of a group known as “Las 17” or “The 17”, which comprises women who were convicted between 1999 and 2011 after losing their babies.

Three of the women have had their convictions overturned after the Citizens Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion – a pro-choice organisation – along with Amnesty International petitioned the Supreme Court to free all 17 of the women.

For Carmen Vasquez, it remains unclear what her next steps will be.

According to local media, her lawyers are still evaluating if there is another legal process they can take.

Stone’s report, which has not been made public, recommends separatingfighters from more moderate detainees, the newspaper said.









It also stated that the US is to help build and finance a new Afghan-run prison for suspected Taliban fighters currently held in the Afghan corrections system.

The remaining inmates would be taught vocational skills and moderate interpretation of Islam with the aim of reintegrating them into society.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador rape victim jailed 30 years for stillbirth,"A 19-year-old rape survivor has been sentenced to 30 years in prison inEl Salvadorafter she suffered a stillbirth due to complications during her pregnancy.









Evelyn Beatriz Hernandez Cruz was convicted of “aggravated homicide” on Wednesday under what Amnesty InternationalcalledEl Salvador’s “retrograde anti-abortion law”.









Local rights groups say Hernandez Cruz had been raped months before going into labour, but had not told police out of fear.

She also said she did not know she was pregnant when she suffered severe abdominal pain and fainted in her bathroom in April 2016.

Hospital staff reported her to officials and she was charged after the body of the feotus was found in a toilet.

According to local media, Hernandez Cruz was convicted on grounds that she did not get prenatal care. Prosecutors also argued that the baby may have died after birth.

El Salvador is one of five countries where abortion is criminalised in all cases.

Under the country’s law, which was implemented in 1998, women can be charged for murder and other related charges even when a pregnancy is the result of rape, incest or when the life or health of the pregnant woman or girl is at risk.

A woman can be punished by up to eight years, and in some cases women have been given sentences of up to 40 years if a judge determines “homicide” was committed.

Politics in El Salvador are highly influenced by the Catholic Church.

“El Salvador’s anti-abortion law is causing nothing but pain and suffering to countless women and girls and their families,” Amnesty’s Americas Director Erika Guevara-Rosas said in a statement on Thursday.

“It goes against human rights and it has no place in the country or anywhere.”

Human Rights Watch has also called the law a risk to “women’s life and health”.

According to the Citizens Group for the Decriminalisation of Abortion (CDFA), Hernandez Cruz’s attorneys plan to appeal the ruling.

“Evelyn has been charged unfairly,” defence attorney Dennis Munoz said, according to CDFA.

“It’s a decision based on morality, not the law or justice.”

El Salvador-based Alliance for Women’s Health and Life documented at least 147 cases where women were charged with crimes under the abortion law between 2000 and 2014.

Among them was Maria Teresa Rivera, who was sentenced to 40 years in prison for “aggravated homicide” in 2011 after having a stillbirth in her bathroom. She did not know she was pregnant at the time.

She was released in 2016 after serving four-and-a-half years.

Pressure from women and rights groups has mounted across Latin America for governments to relax abortion laws.

Salvador Prison,The Take: What Trump’s Alien Enemies Act means for the US today,"

By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, United States President Donald Trump launched a constitutional showdown and sent aspiring Americans to El Salvador to some of the worst prisons in the world. After putting the law on pause, a federal judge is questioning the legality of these deportations, leaving many in the US to wonder what’s next.

Salvador Prison,Trump orders rebuilding and reopening of notorious Alcatraz prison in US,"United States President Donald Trump says he has ordered officials to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz, a notorious federal prison based on a small island in the state of California that has been shut for more than 60 years.

In a post on his Truth Social site on Sunday, Trump wrote he is “directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ” to house the US’s “most ruthless and violent Offenders”.









The directive was the latest move by the Republican to overhaul how and where federal prisoners and immigration detainees are locked up.



It comes as his administrationhas been clashingwith the judiciary after invoking an18th century law– previously used only during wartime – to deport those it alleges are criminals and gang members, without due process.

Trumphas also repeatedly floated the legally dubious ideaof sending US citizens convicted of violent crimes to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, known as CECOT.







Speaking to reporters as he returned to the White House after a weekend in Florida, Trump said reopening Alcatraz was “just an idea I’ve had” amid frustrations with “radicalised judges” who have insisted those being deported receive due process.

“It’s a symbol of law and order,” he said.

The comments followed the airing of an interview in which the presidentsaidhe “didn’t know” whether people in the US are entitled to due process rights guaranteed by the country’s Constitution.

The Constitution’s Fifth Amendment provides “due process of law”, meaning a person has certain rights when it comes to being prosecuted for a crime. Also, the 14th Amendment says no state can “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”.

Alcatraz was billed as the most secure prison in the US, given the island location, frigid waters and strong currents.

No successful escapes were ever officially recorded from Alcatraz during the 29 years it was open, though five prisoners are listed as “missing and presumed drowned”. Overall, 36 men attempted 14 separate escapes.

The prison, which has been the subject of several films, was closed in 1963 due to crumbling infrastructure and high repair and supply costs, as everything – from fuel to food – had to be brought by boat.

It was nearly three times costlier to operate than any other federal prison, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) website.

Bringing the facility up to modern-day standards would require massive investments at a time when the BOP has been shuttering prisons for similar infrastructure issues.

Alcatraz Island is now an important tourist site that is operated by the National Park Service and is a designated National Historic Landmark.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes the island, questioned the feasibility of reopening the prison after so many years.

“It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President’s proposal is not a serious one,” she wrote on X.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/5/trump-orders-rebuilding-and-reopening-of-notorious-alcatraz-prison-in-us,NEGATIVE,0.9490165710449219
Salvador Prison,Trump faces contempt risk: What happens if president violates court orders?,"US President Donald Trump’s administration could be held incriminal contempt of courtfor disobeying an order to stop thedeportations of alleged Venezuelangang members who could not challenge their deportation, federal judge James Boasberg said on Wednesday.

Boasberg has given the US government one week to remedy its dismissal of his order by providing the deported men with the right to due process in court. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling. The judge’s Wednesday ruling is thelatest additionto thegrowing pile of legal challengesthat Trump’s executive orders and actions are facing.

So, what does it mean to be held in contempt of court? What’s next? And what happens if a president simply refuses to follow a court’s orders?

Late on March 15, Boasberg had issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from exercising theAlien Enemies Act of 1798to carry out deportations. Boasberg is the chief judge of the District Court for the District of Columbia.

The Alien Enemies Act gives the US president the discretion to detain or deport non-citizens during wartime. The president can carry out these deportations based solely on citizenship status, without a hearing.

While issuing the restraining order, Boasberg had also ordered that deportation flights en route to El Salvador turn around and return.

Hours after this restraining order was issued, on the morning of March 16,El Salvador President Nayib Bukeleclaimed in an X post that his country had received238 membersof the Venezuelan gangTren de Araguaand 23 members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 from the US. Bukele also reposted a news snippet about Boasberg’s ruling, captioning it: “Oopsie … Too late” with a crying-with-laughter emoji.

Oopsie…

Too late 😂pic.twitter.com/nDHL6deLJq

— Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele)March 16, 2025



The alleged gang members are being held in a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, the Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism (Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo) or CECOT.

In a post on March 18 on his Truth Social platform, Trump called Boasberg a “Radical Left Lunatic” and called for his impeachment. Trump’s impeachment call was shot down by Chief Justice John Roberts, who said that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”

Boasberg had also demanded that the government reveal the flight timings of the plane that carried those deportees, to establish whether it indeed could have turned around and returned to the US following his order.

But on March 24, the US Department of Justice revealed that the Trump administration was invoking the “state secrets privilege” to avoid providing these details. The doctrine is supposed to be invoked when military or national security interests are at risk.

On April 3, Boasberg weighed contempt during a hearing where he pressed the Justice Department to find out whether the Trump administration had flouted the restraining order. The Justice Department denied this, saying the flights had already left the US by the time the restraining order was filed.

The US Supreme Courtallowed the Trump administrationto deport immigrants on April 7, but held that they must get a court hearing before they are deported.

In a 46-page ruling on Wednesday, Boasberg wrote that the Trump administration’s actions were “sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt”.

He wrote that the deportees were rushed out to El Salvador by the US government, before they could challenge their deportations in court, despite his temporary restraining order.

“The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders – especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,” wrote Boasberg.

Boasberg also noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio reposted Bukele’s post in which he had reposted the news snippet. “Boasts by Defendants intimated that they had defied the Court’s Order deliberately and gleefully,” wrote Boasberg.

Contempt of court refers to the willful disobedience of the court of law or its officers.

Contempt of court can be civil contempt, which happens when someone fails to abide by a court order or disrupts court proceedings; or criminal contempt, when someone deliberately or willfully disrespects a court’s orders.

In most cases, courts censure, but don’t punish, those it holds guilty of civil contempt if they eventually comply with its orders.

Criminal contempt of court, on the other hand, carries a punishment spelled out in the statute books – a fine of up to $1,000, a prison sentence of up to six months, or both.

“Flouting a court order would be an impeachable offence for failing to faithfully execute the laws as required by Article 2 of the Constitution,” Bruce Fein, an American lawyer specialising in constitutional and international law, told Al Jazeera. Article 2 of the US Constitution details the power and responsibilities held by the US president. One such responsibility is that the president “shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed”.

Boasberg has said that White House officials can avoid being held in criminal contempt by reversing their disregard for his restraining order. They can do this by allowing the deported men to challenge their deportations in court. He gave the White House an April 23 deadline.

The White House could alternatively identify the officials who decided not to turn the planes around, disregarding his order, so that they can be prosecuted.

In this case, the Justice Department has appealed the ruling before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.

In all, the Trump administration facesmore than 190 legal challengesto its policies, according to Just Security, a non-partisan digital law and policy journal.

The US government recently acknowledged that it had deported Salvadoran citizenKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, 29, to CECOT as an “administrative error.” On April 10, the US Supreme Courtruledin a 9-0 decision that Trump should facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the US. On Tuesday, US DistrictJudge Paula Xinisin Maryland said she would probe whether the Trump administration violated an order to secure Abrego Garcia’s return. However, Xinis said she does not yet plan to hold the government in contempt.

A court can, as Boasberg has threatened to do, hold specific officials in contempt.

However, the president can pardon officials convicted of criminal contempt. During his first term in 2017,Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, a former county sheriff, who was found guilty of criminal contempt after he defied a court order asking him to stopracially profilingLatinos. Usually, as the White House has done in this case, the government appeals a court’s ruling.

That process of appeals can go all the way up to the Supreme Court.

But ultimately, the task of enforcing a contempt order falls on the US Marshals Service, which comes under the Department of Justice, a part of the Trump administration. While law enforcement officials are expected to follow court rulings, that has not always been the case.

Fein told Al Jazeera that the court could also hold Trump himself in contempt.

Congress could also impeach him for violating a court order. But to remove him from office, the motion would need a majority vote in the House and a two-thirds majority in the Senate. TheHousecurrently has 218 Republican members and 213 Democrats, while theSenatehas 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents.

A Congress “currently controlled by Republicans, will not act unless the American people demand the same through phone calls, emails, and demonstrations,” Fein said.

“The bottom line: whether we remain a government of laws in lieu of a government of men is now up to Congress and ultimately, the American people.”

Yes, it has – during Trump’s first term.

Soon after taking office in 2017, Trump signed an executive order banning nationals from multiple Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. Multiple federal judges issued orders suspending the ban, deeming it unconstitutional. However, Democrats and lawyers at airports complained that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents were going against these suspensions and detaining refugees and travellers from the Muslim countries.

In June 2018, the US Supreme Court eventually upheld the travel ban in a 5-4 ruling, reversing the multiple lower court rulings that had suspended it.

But while Trump’s clashes with judges are well known, he isn’t the first president to find himself at odds with the courts.

Some have come close to defying even Supreme Court orders.

Kind of. The most notable example of this is former President Abraham Lincoln defying former Chief Justice Roger Taney. At the beginning of the US Civil War in 1861, Lincoln suspended a writ of habeas corpus to imprison people suspected of being Confederate sympathisers. Habeas corpus is a centuries-old common law principle that allows a detainee to challenge their detention in court. Chief Justice Taney held that Congress had the power to suspend the writ, not the US president. Lincoln largely ignored Taney’s opinion. However, Taney was “riding circuit” at the time and his opinion was filed with the Circuit Court for the District of Maryland, not the US Supreme Court, and historians continue to argue about the authority through which Taney issued his ruling.

At the beginning of World War II in 1942, Democrat President Franklin D Roosevelt invoked a proclamation authorising the trial of eight German saboteurs at a military tribunal. While Roosevelt suggested he would go ahead with this whether or not the Supreme Court thought he was right, the top court eventually backed the president’s policy.

There have also been instances in which US presidents have nearly defied the Supreme Court. In 1974, in the wake of theWatergate Scandal, former President Richard Nixon claimed that the concept of executive privilege allowed him to withhold sensitive information, such as communication between officials and tape recordings, from investigators. The Supreme Court unanimously disagreed with Nixon, who ended up complying with the court shortly after the ruling. Two weeks after the ruling, Nixon resigned.

George W Bush, Republican president from 2001 to 2009, clashed with the Supreme Court when his post-9/11 strategy for national security clashed with a Supreme Court ruling on the treatment of prisoners held atGuantanamo Bay. But Bush also eventually deferred to the Supreme Court.

Presidents have also been called on to enforce Supreme Court contempt orders. In 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower sent a thousand army troops to Arkansas to enforce the Supreme Court ruling on desegregating schools after the state governor backed the segregationists.

However, presidents have not always deferred to the top court.

In 1832, President Andrew Jackson allowed Georgia’s governor to ignore a Supreme Court order protecting the Cherokee community’s right to remain on their native land. However, the court had not ordered the federal government to take any action, so Jackson never officially refused to enforce the decision.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/18/trump-faces-contempt-risk-what-happens-if-president-violates-court-orders,NEGATIVE,0.941196620464325
Salvador Prison,El Salvador criminalises showing gang-related messages in media,"El Salvador’s Congress has approved a request by President Nayib Bukele to criminalise gang-related messages in the media, including news outlets, in a step to control the rising cases of homicides in the Latin American nation.

The move on Tuesday, which includes 10 to 15-year sentences for offenders, comes amid a government crackdown on gangs that has led to one of the world’s highest murder rates. The crackdown, which included Bukeleinvoking emergency powersto suspend some constitutional rights in February, has led to concerns over human rights abuses.

“When the Germans wanted to eradicate Nazism, they prohibited by law all Nazi symbology, as well as messages, apologies and everything aimed at promoting Nazism,” Bukele wrote on Twitter. “Now we will do the same with gangs.”

The reform to the penal code applies to those who “reproduce and transmit messages or communications originating or allegedly originating from said criminal groups that could generate anxiety and panic among the general population”.

The measure also targets those who “mark” their territories with acronyms, referring to a common practice gang members use to threaten those who report them to authorities.

The new policy was quickly met with “concern” from El Salvador’s journalists’ association over what they called a “clear attempt at censorship”.

In a statement, the group refered to the measure as a “gag” reform, saying it “threatens with imprisonment the media and journalists who report on a reality that the current administration … seeks to hide.”

They called the measure a “new tool to criminalise journalistic work”.

El Salvador declared a state of emergency on March 27 following three days ofintense violencein which the government registered 87 murders, 62 of those occurring in just a single day.

In the days since, Salvadoran authorities have arrested 6,312 alleged gang members.

Last week, Congress increased the maximum prison sentence for being a gang member from nine to 45 years. The government also raised maximum prison sentences for children and will allow teenagers to be tried as adults for the most serious offences, and serve their sentences in adult prisons rather than juvenile detention facilities.

On Tuesday, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rightsexpressed concernabout the government’s approach, citing “alleged cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”.

“In addition to the state of emergency, we are deeply concerned about certain amendments to criminal law and criminal procedure,” said the office’s spokeswoman Liz Throssell.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/6/el-salvador-criminalises-showing-gang-related-messages-in-media,NEGATIVE,0.9684630632400513
Salvador Prison,‘All Salvadorans at risk’: Inside El Salvador’s gang crackdown,"The government of El Salvador has arrested more than 14,000 people in three weeks, after itdeclareda “state of exception” in response to a spike in gang violence that grants the state sweeping powers and suspends some civil liberties.

Human rights groups have raised alarm at the intensity of President Nayib Bukele’s mass arrests and intensifying criminalisation of critics, including journalists, saying it is the latest example of his push to rapidly consolidate power since he took office in 2019.

“What is being tested by this situation is the tolerance of Salvadoran society for these rights to be limited,” said Eduardo Escobar, director of Citizen Action (Accion Ciudadana), a Salvadoran civil society organisation dedicated to transparency and anti-corruption reform.

“Because everything the government is doing now means restricting rights, and expanding the power of the state over the life of Salvadorans.”

On April 20, Bukele announced via Twitter that in just 25 days his government had arrested more than 14,000 “terrorists”, referring to accused gang members who authorities said are responsible for the country’s most violent day in 20 years.

More than 60 people were murdered on March 26. By the end of that weekend, 87 people had been killed and the Central American nation wasreeling from the violence.

Both MS-13 and two factions of the Barrio 18 gangs have fuelled El Salvador’s soaring murder rates in recent years, which peaked in 2015. When Bukele took office in 2019, becoming the region’s youngest president, already declining homicides rates further decreased.

He credited his security plan for the drop, but Salvadoran investigative media outlet El Farorevealedin September 2020 that Bukele officials had negotiated with MS-13 leadership for a decrease in homicides.

“What’s worrying is that our rights are being limited to the applause of the people, under the false idea that the government is providing security,” Escobar told Al Jazeera.

Bukele has said his government is cleaning up the streets of El Salvador through mass detentions.

But human rights groups say they have documenteda pattern of human rights abusesand due process violations, while the sheer number of arrests threatens to overwhelm an already overburdened justice system, compounding the country’s insecurity problems.

Human Rights Watch researcher Juan Pappier told Al Jazeera he has documented about 50 cases of human rights or due process violations related to the detentions so far.

They tend to follow a pattern, he said: Police first enter poor neighbourhoods with a known gang presence and round up residents, mostly young men, and then take them to the police station, where their family members are often allowed to see them briefly. Then they are sent into the penitentiary system, which is where they often get “lost”, according to Pappier.

Family members do not know which prison their loved ones have been sent to and inquiries through the official channels come up blank. This has resulted in distressed friends and family members, often mothers, wives and girlfriends, showing up outside prisons searching for information about their loved ones.

“In some cases, we’ve documented they have not been able to speak with them for several days, even for some weeks,” Pappier said.

“What is important to emphasise here is that the laws that Bukele and his allies passed are not simply harsh laws against gang members,” he added. “They are laws that put all Salvadorans at risk, that undermine their capacity to defend themselves in a criminal process, and that open the door to disproportionate sentences against people who have nothing to do with gangs.”

The number of detentions is incomparable to anything El Salvador has seen in past government crackdowns on gang violence, said Abraham Abrego, director of strategic litigation at Salvadoran human rights organisation Cristosal.

At least the past three administrations have carried out raids in response to surges in violence, but nowhere close to this number of people have been brought into the penitentiary system at once, he said. El Salvador has the second-highest incarceration rate per capita in the world, after the United States,accordingto Prison Policy Initiative.

Lawyers and public defenders are also overwhelmed by the influx in cases, according to Abrego. Few independent judges remain afterBukele’s partypassed a reform last year giving widespread authority to the Supreme Court — led by the president’s allies — to remove judges and force them into retirement arbitrarily.

On social media, friends and family members have shared photos of loved ones who they believe were unjustly swept up in the arrests in the hopes of pressuring authorities to free them.

On April 15, Salvadoran National Police knocked on the door of 25-year-old Kevin Rivas’s house in Soyapango, a neighbourhood on the outskirts of the capital, San Salvador, known for its gang presence, and arrested him.

Neighbours and family members told Salvadoran media GatoEncerrado that Rivas, who works in documentaries and audiovisual production, has no gang connections, but rather has worked with youth in the community.

“Nayib Bukele, is this really this country that you are creating? Putting in jail people who are innocent and who have even worked for the social development of youth,” wrote one friend on Twitter, according to astatementshared by the human rights group SOS El Salvador. After tweets by his parents and sisters with the hashtag #justiciaparakevin (#justiceforkevin) gained hundreds of likes, Rivas was released on April 17.

Bukele hasbrushed offany detentions of people without gang connections as “mistakes”.

But Abrego said many of the arrests have clearly been arbitrary, because when relatives have spoken out and drawn public attention to the detention of someone with no connection to gangs, the authorities have released them quickly. Cristosal has documented more than 90 cases it said were arbitrary arrests, but believed the number could be much higher due to a fear of speaking out.

Alongside the mass detentions, Bukele’s partypassed a lawon April 5 prohibiting the media from sharing any gang messages or messages that could incite panic in the population. The penalty for violating the law is up to 15 years in prison.

On April 19, Cristosal filed apetitionto challenge the legislation as a violation of the constitution, both on procedural grounds and for limiting freedom of expression. At leastfour journalistshave fled the country because of threats related to their work, according to the country’s journalism association.

The law is meant to create a culture of intimidation, said Pappier, “in a context where this man [Bukele] controls all the branches of power and can decide simply through his Twitter handle whatever happens in the country, whatever laws are applied, the way a judge should rule on a case or how many people should be arrested by police.”

The government has defended its actions as necessary security measures, and attacked journalists and human rights groups who criticised the recent measures as being complicit with the gangs.

“A consequence of all those people, NGOs, the media, political parties and even ‘friendly’ governments having come out to defend gang members … is that now the Salvadoran people will be clear about who has been behind the bloodshed of their family and friends,” Bukele tweeted on April 11.

But human rights groups have said this is a distortion of their arguments against Bukele’s tactics, which they add will not improve security in El Salvador. “We’re not against legal action against the gangs. What we’ve said is that it doesn’t require a state of exception to do it,” said Escobar. “This is not going to resolve the gang problem.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/21/all-salvadorans-at-risk-inside-el-salvadors-gang-crackdown,NEGATIVE,0.8040369749069214
Salvador Prison,"El Salvador sends 8,000 troops, police to rural province in gang crackdown","Thousands of Salvadoran soldiers and police officers on Tuesday surrounded the central agricultural region of Cabanas – home to some 150,000 people – as part of President Nayib Bukele’s crackdown on gang activity.

Bukele imposed a state of emergency in March 2022 that has seen tens ofthousandsof alleged gang members rounded up, raising alarms from rights groups.

Groups such Human Rights Watch and El Salvador-based Cristosal havedocumentedwidespread abuses, including enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and torture.

Security forces have on several occasions besieged key cities to carry out house-to-house searches for gang members, but it is the first time an entire department (administrative region) is being cordoned off. The Latin American country is divided into 14 departments.

“Since this morning, 7,000 soldiers and 1,000 police officers have established a security fence around the entire department of Cabanas,” Bukele wrote on Twitter, now called X.

“Their job will be to prevent gang members from leaving the area and cut off all supply lines belonging to terrorist groups.”

He said the blockade would last until “the operatives can extract all gang members”.

Trucks loaded with soldiers were seen in the streets of the towns of Tejutepeque and Ilobasco.

“Since this morning we have noticed the presence of soldiers,” radio host Reina Navarrete told AFP news agency from another town, Victoria.

Tuesday’s action was the fifth such mass raid since the crackdown started. In May, the government sent 5,000 soldiers and police to the northern township of Nueva Concepcion after a police officer was killed there.

Police dismantled several camps they described as gang hideouts in Cabanas during a previous raid in 2022.

Bukele imposed the state of emergency, which allows arrests without a warrant, after a particularly bloody weekend in March 2022 left 87 civilians dead at the hands of gang members.

Since then, some 72,000 alleged gang members have been arrested.

Last week, politicianspasseda temporary measure allowing for up to 900 people to be tried at once.

Salvador Prison,Hundreds jailed for abortion in El Salvador,"San Salvador, El Salvador– When Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage three-years ago, she was handcuffed to a hospital bed, surrounded by seven policemen, charged with murder and sent to jail.

Rivera is among hundreds of women believed wrongly jailed in El Salvador for defying a ban on abortion, accused of inducing abortions when in fact they suffered miscarriages, stillbirths, or pregnancy complications, women’s rights groups say.









After a trial lasting eight months, 30-year-old Rivera was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment for aggravated murder – the longest sentence ever imposed on a woman in the Central American nation for an abortion crime.

She is one of 17 women, all jailed for more than 30 years, that human rights groups are campaigning to set free.

“The judge didn’t believe me when I told him that I didn’t even know I was pregnant at the time and that I’d started bleeding at home and had a miscarriage,” Rivera said from Ilopango women’s prison on the outskirts of the capital, San Salvador.

I thought about my young son who'll be nearly 50 by the time I'm released... My son won't know me when I leave jail.

by- Maria Teresa Rivera





“I’ll never understand why he was so harsh. I thought about my young son who’ll be nearly 50 by the time I’m released…  My son won’t know me when I leave jail.”

No abortion allowed

Abortion in El Salvador has been illegal under all circumstances since 1998, even in cases of rape, incest, a deformed foetus, or when a women’s life is in danger.

El Salvador is one of 28 countries globally that prohibits abortion in all circumstances, according to the Centre for Reproductive Rights.

Rights group Amnesty International says this outright abortion ban is a leading cause of maternal mortality because it forces women to undergo dangerous back-street abortions.

The ban in El Salvador has led to 129 women being prosecuted for abortion or aggravated murder, of which 26 were convicted of murder and imprisoned,according to the Citizen Group for the Decriminalisation of Therapeutic, Ethical and Eugenic Abortion (CFDA), a local rights organisation.

The campaign to free the 17 women by CFDA and international human rights groups has highlighted the impact of El Salvador’s abortion law on women, who in many cases are already young single mothers, from poor backgrounds and with little education.

Wealthier women can travel abroad for abortions in private clinics but El Salvador’s healthy ministry estimates there are 6,500 clandestine abortions in El Salvador every year, and 11 percent of women and girls who have undergone a clandestine abortion have died, according to the World Health Organisation.

Last year the plight of “Beatriz”, an ill, 22-year-old rural woman from El Salvador carrying a malformed foetus, sparked global outcry when the high court upheld the abortion ban, even though her life was at risk and the foetus unlikely to survive.

After a legal battle lasting months that escalated to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the El Salvadoran court finally relented and Beatriz underwent a Caesarian section and survived the operation. Her baby lived only a few hours.

El Salvador is now facing increasing pressure from the United Nations, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, and rights groups to amend its abortion law and release women jailed on abortion crimes.

‘Baby killer’

Ilopango women’s jail, tucked behind a busy suburban street, was originally built to house 220 inmates but now has nearly 2,000 prisoners, making it El Salvador’s most overcrowded jail.

Rivera, who has served three years of her prison sentence, will never forget her first night behind bars. She slept on the bare floor and when the lights went out at 10pm inmates chanted “baby killer” as she lay awake until dawn.

“Ending my life did cross my mind then,” said Rivera, a single mother and former garment factory worker, whose son now lives with his grandmother.

The only glimmer of hope for Rivera and the other 16 women is the campaign to set them free spearheaded by Dennis Munoz, an El Salvadoran human rights lawyer working for CDFA.

In May, on behalf of CFDA and international rights groups, Munoz submitted a petition to local lawmakers seeking a pardon for the 17 imprisoned women and their release. All other legal avenues had been exhausted in their cases.

Munoz said their convictions are based on flimsy medical evidence, flawed trials and inconsistent judicial rulings.

“I’m known as the abortion lawyer, the one defending ‘child murderers’ as the right-wing press here has branded these women,” Munoz said outside the jail gates.

“What motivates me is to help poor people, who have the right to a good lawyer, and get innocent people out of jail. If this was my daughter, I wouldn’t want her to suffer for a crime she didn’t commit.”

El Salvador’s Supreme Court is considering the petition with a decision expected within weeks. Eight of 15 judges would need to rule in favour of the women for them to be released, and President Salvador Sanchez Ceren would need to agree.

If all other legal mechanisms in El Salvador fail, the cases of the 17 women could be taken before the Washington-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Munoz said.

“I’ve told them I can’t promise to get you out of jail or that I’m going to win. But I will put up a fight, and a good fight,” said Munoz, who has secured the early release of eight women jailed for abortion crimes since 2007.

Powerful Catholic Church

Munoz is aware that a big part of his fight means coming up against a powerful conservative lobby in the country’s congress, and an influential Roman Catholic Church and evangelical groups, who are all determined to maintain the outright abortion ban.

Here social and cultural norms are based on religious values, and not on a right-based approach.

by- Mario Soriano,  medical doctor





They say the rights of an unborn child, which are enshrined in El Salvador’s constitution, should be protected by law at all costs, from the moment of conception.

Opposition conservative lawmakers, as well as the left-wing ruling FMLN party, fear easing the abortion ban would come at a political cost as it could alienate voters and the church.

“Some kind of election takes place every 18 months in El Salvador so it’s difficult to make progress on the abortion issue because politicians worry decriminalising abortion will mean losing votes,” Munoz said.

With the issue of abortion an entrenched part of El Salvador’s political battleground, few government officials are willing to publicly favour changing the abortion law.

Mario Soriano, a medical doctor who heads the adolescent development programme at El Salvador’s health ministry, is a rare voice calling for change, in favour of easing the country’s abortion law.

“Here social and cultural norms are based on religious values, and not on a right-based approach,” Soriano said.

“Religious values often outweigh clinical ethics, as well as the law being applied incorrectly, which means you can get doctors denouncing women of inducing abortions and then calling police to the hospital.”

For Rivera her only source of solace is reading the bible at the prison church.

“I pray to God for this to end soon. I just want to be with my son and tuck him into bed. I was an orphan – and now my son is too,” she said.

Salvador Prison,"Sleepless nights, letter to Nassar: Epstein’s final days revealed","Two weeks before ending his life, Jeffrey Epstein sat in the corner of his Manhattan jail cell with his hands over his ears, desperate to muffle the sound of a toilet that wouldn’t stop running.

Epstein was agitated and unable to sleep, jail officials observed, in records newly obtained by the Associated Press (AP). He called himself a “coward” and complained he was struggling to adapt to life behind bars following hisJuly 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges– his life of luxury reduced to a concrete and steel cage.

The disgraced financier was under psychological observation at the time for a suicide attempt just days earlier that left his neck bruised and scraped. Yet, even after a 31-hour stint on suicide watch, Epstein insisted he wasn’t suicidal, telling a jail psychologist he had a “wonderful life” and “would be crazy” to end it.

On August 10, 2019,Epstein was dead.

Nearly four years later, the AP has obtained more than 4,000 pages of documents related to Epstein’s death from the Federal Bureau of Prisons under the Freedom of Information Act. They include a detailed psychological reconstruction of the events leading to Epstein’s suicide, as well as his health history, internal agency reports, emails, memos and other records.

Taken together, the documents the AP obtained Thursday provide the most complete accounting to date of Epstein’s detention and death and its chaotic aftermath. The records help to dispel the many conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein’s suicide, underscoring how fundamental failings at the Bureau of Prisons – including severe staffing shortages and employees cutting corners – contributed to Epstein’s death.

They shed new light on the federal prison agency’s muddled response after Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at the now-shuttered Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City.

In one email, a prosecutor involved in Epstein’s criminal case complained about a lack of information from the Bureau of Prisons in the critical hours after his death, writing that it was “frankly unbelievable” that the agency was issuing public press releases “before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family”.

In another email, a high-ranking Bureau of Prisons official made a spurious suggestion to the agency’s director that news reporters must have been paying jail employees for information about Epstein’s death because they were reporting details of the agency’s failings – impugning the ethics of journalists and the agency’s own workers.

The documents also provide a fresh window into Epstein’s behaviour during his 36 days in jail, including his previously unreported attempt to connect by mail with another high-profile paedophile: Larry Nassar, the US gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of athletes.

Epstein’s letter to Nassar was found returned to sender in the jail’s mail room weeks after Epstein’s death.

“It appeared he mailed it out and it was returned back to him,” the investigator who found the letter told a prison official by email. “I am not sure if I should open it or should we hand it over to anyone?”

The letter itself was not included among the documents turned over to the AP.

The night before Epstein’s death, he excused himself from a meeting with his lawyers to make a telephone call to his family. According to a memo from a unit manager, Epstein told a jail employee that he was calling his mother, who’d been dead for 15 years at that point.

Epstein’s death put increased scrutiny on the Bureau of Prisons and led the agency to close the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 2021. It spurred an AP investigation that has uncovered deep, previously unreported problems within the agency, the justice department’s largestwith more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates and an $8bn annual budget.

An internal memo, undated but sent after Epstein’s death, attributed problems at the jail to “seriously reduced staffing levels, improper or lack of training and follow-up and oversight”.

The memo also detailed steps the Bureau of Prisons has taken to remedy lapses that Epstein’s suicide had exposed, including requiring supervisors to review surveillance video to ensure officers made required cell checks.

Epstein’s lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said people detained at the facility endured “medieval conditions of confinement that no American defendant should have been subjected to”.

“It’s sad, it’s tragic, that it took this kind of event to finally cause the Bureau of Prisons to close this regrettable institution,” Weinberg said Thursday in a phone interview.

The workers tasked with guarding Epstein the night he killed himself, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged with lying on prison records to make it seem as though they had made their required checks before Epstein was found lifeless. Epstein’s cellmate did not return after a court hearing the day before, and prison officials failed to pair another prisoner with him, leaving him alone.

Prosecutors alleged they were sitting at their desks just 15 feet (4.6 metres) from Epstein’s cell, shopped online for furniture and motorcycles, and walked around the unit’s common area instead of making required rounds every 30 minutes.

During one two-hour period, both appeared to have been asleep, according to their indictment. Noel and Thomas admitted to falsifying the log entries but avoided prison time under a deal with federal prosecutors. Copies of some of those logs were included among the documents released Thursday, with the guards’ signatures redacted.

Another investigation, by the justice department’s inspector general, is still ongoing.

Epstein arrived at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on July 6, 2019. He spent 22 hours in the jail’s general population before officials moved him to the special housing unit “due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among the inmate population”, according to the psychological reconstruction of his death.

Epstein later said he was upset about having to wear an orange jumpsuit provided to inmates in the special housing unit and complained about being treated like he was a “bad guy” despite being well-behaved behind bars. He requested a brown uniform for his near-daily visits with his lawyers.

During an initial health screening, the 66-year-old said that he had 10-plus female sexual partners within the previous five years. Medical records showed he was suffering from sleep apnea, constipation, hypertension, lower back pain and prediabetes and had been previously treated for chlamydia.

Epstein did make some attempts to adapt to his jailhouse surroundings, the records show. He signed up for a Kosher meal and told prison officials, through his lawyer, that he wanted permission to exercise outside. Two days before he was found dead, Epstein bought $73.85 worth of items from the prison commissary, including an AM/FM radio and headphones. He had $566 left in his account when he died.

Epstein’s outlook worsened when a judge denied him bail on July 18, 2019 – raising the prospect that he’d remain locked up until trial and possibly longer. If convicted, he would have faced up to 45 years in prison. Four days later, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck.

Epstein survived. His injuries didn’t require going to the hospital. He was placed on suicide watch and, later, psychiatric observation. Jail officers noted in logs that they observed him, “sitting at the edge of the bed, lost in thought”, and sitting “with his head against the wall”.

Epstein expressed frustration with the noise of the jail and his lack of sleep. During his first few weeks at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Epstein didn’t have his sleep apnea breathing apparatus he used. Then the toilet in his cell started acting up.

“He was still left in the same cell with a broken toilet,” the jail’s chief psychologist wrote in an email the next day. “Please move him to the cell next door when he returns from legal, as the toilet still does not work.”

The day before Epstein ended his life, a federal judge unsealed about 2,000 pages of documents in a sexual abuse lawsuit against him. That development, prison officials observed, further eroded Epstein’s previous elevated status.

That, combined with a lack of significant interpersonal connections and “the idea of potentially spending his life in prison were likely factors contributing to Mr Epstein’s suicide,” officials wrote.

Salvador Prison,Investigating El Salvador’s crackdown on gangs,"

It has been more than a year since El Salvador declared a state of emergency as part of President Nayib Bukele’s promise to crack down on gangs. Since March 2022, the country’s murder rate has dropped by more than half. But, in the process, the government arrested almost 70,000 people while suspending every citizen’s constitutional right to legal defence and allowing indefinite pre-trial detention. Despite El Salvador’s repressive new reality, Bukele and his policy remain extremely popular. Raising the question, is El Salvador becoming a police state?

Salvador Prison,Israel vows to ‘worsen’ conditions for Palestinian prisoners,"Israel’s Public Security MinisterGilad Erdanhas announced plans to “worsen” conditions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, including rationing water supplies and reducing the number of family visits.

The planned moves, which are expected to come into force in the coming weeks after being approved by the Israeli cabinet, were sharply criticised by Palestinian leaders and activists who described as them as another escalation of human rights violations by Israel.









Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Erdan said the plan will also see jails removing cooking rights and limitingprisoners’ access to television as well as blocking funds to the Palestinian Authority.

The minister said that family visits had already been halted for prisoners affiliated with the Palestinian movementHamas.

“The plan also includes preventing members of the Knesset [Israel’s parliament] from visiting Palestinian detainees,” added Erdan,who last year set up a committee to make prison conditions harsher for those who “committed acts of terrorism”.

The policy of separating Hamas prisoners from those affiliated with rival Palestinian factionFatahwill also come to an end, as Erdan said that holding inmates in cells based on organisational affiliation resulted in “strengthening their organisation identity”.

The minister also said that there will be “clear limits” on the amount of water a prisoner consumes each day, including a cap on the number of times they are allowed to shower.

Mustafa Barghouti, head of the Palestinian National Initiative party, told Al Jazeera that the Israeli government acts like it has a free hand to oppress Palestinians in any way they want.

“The only way to force Israel to abstain from this behaviour is to impose sanctions on Israel,” he said, speaking from the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah.

“Israel is behaving as if it is above international law and this must change.”

The Palestinian Prisoners’ Commission denounced Erdan’s plans and said they were an attempt to make Palestinian prisoners’ lives even more unbearable.

Qadri Abubaker, the head of the Prisoners’ Commission, called for a strong national stand against these measures.

Such decisions and laws “calls for everyone to rally at the official, popular, legal, media and human rights level to expose these arrogant policies against our heroes in prisons”, he told Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency.

According to officialstatistics, the number ofPalestinian prisonersbehind bars has reached 5,500, including 230 children and 54 women.

Rights groups say more than 1,800 are in need of medical care, with about 700 suffering from serious or chronic illnesses.

Many Palestinian prisoners say they have been subject to torture and violence while in custody. There have been many protests against poor conditions in recent years, including several hunger strikes.

During Wednesday’s press conference, Erdan said the Israeli government would “not be deterred by threats and [hunger] strikes”.

“We must make conditions worse [for prisoners] to fulfil our moral duty to terror victims and their families,” he added, going on to assertthat the Israeli prison service was ready to “deal with any scenario”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/1/3/israel-vows-to-worsen-conditions-for-palestinian-prisoners,NEGATIVE,0.9965898990631104
Salvador Prison,Salvadoran woman jailed for suspected abortion released,"Women’s rights advocates have welcomed the release of a woman in El Salvador who was sentenced to a lengthy prison term for a suspected abortion, in a case that has drawn international attention to the South Americannation’s strict abortion ban.

Sara Rogel, 28, was arrested in October 2012 after going to a hospital with bleeding injuries caused by what she said was a fall while carrying out chores at home.

Then a 22-year-old student, Rogel was prosecuted and sentenced to 30 years in prison for killing her unborn daughter. Her sentence was later reduced to 10 years, which would have seen her released in October 2022.

On Monday, she left a women’s jail near Zacatecoluca, about 56km (35 miles) southeast of the capital San Salvador, where she was joined by members of her family and her lawyer Karla Vaquerano of the pro-abortion rights group ACDATEE.

“She was deprived of freedom for almost nine years, in a sentence we believed was unfairly given,” Vaquerano said.

Rogel was one of dozens of Salvadoran women imprisoned for abortion-related crimes in the country, which banned abortion in all circumstances, including rape or if the mother’s life is in danger, in 1998.

Women’s rights groups have said most of these women come from poor, rural areas and experienced obstetric emergencies, not abortions.

“Sara never deserved to be in prison,” feminist activist Morena Herrera said. “While in mourning for the heartbreaking loss of her pregnancy, Sara should have been with her family. Instead, she was unjustly imprisoned for nine years.”

Rogel’s case had drawn international attention and calls for action.

“If El Salvador is really serious about its international obligations to human rights, this is an opportunity to free Sarita,” said Paula Avila-Guillen, a lawyer consulting for Rogel’s legal team,told Al Jazeera in March.

Avila-Guillen, executive director of Women’s Equality Center, a US-based organisation that supports feminist organising in Latin America, welcomed the news of Rogel’s release on Monday, but said the fight would continue.

“She had to suffer not only with the loss of her pregnancy, but also the loss of her freedom. We won’t stop fighting until ALL the women are free!” she wrote.

In recent years some rulings have been reversed, with several womenreleased from jailafter serving parts of their long sentences.

Rogel’s release comes amid a “green wave” abortion rights movement in Latin America.

Aftera decades-long fightby women’s rights advocates in Argentina, the country’s senate in Decemberlegalised abortion, while Ecuadordecriminalised abortionin cases of rape in April.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador vows harsh response after slaying of police officer,"The government of El Salvador has deployed thousands of soldiers and police officers to a small town in a show of force after a police officer was killed by an alleged gang member.

More than 5,000 soldiers and 500 police officers encircled the northern city of Nueva Concepcion on Wednesday, with Salvadoran PresidentNayib Bukelesaying that they would seek out those responsible.

“They will pay dearly for the murder of our hero,” Bukele said in a Twitter post, adding that forces would seek out “the entire gang structure and collaborators still hiding in that place”.

The Bukele government has launched a nationwide crackdown on the country’s gangs over the last year, winning widespread support from the public but sparking concerns about systematichuman rights abuses.







The government declared a “state of exception”, suspending key civil liberties in March 2022 after gangs were blamed for a spate of killings.

The governmenthas extendedthe order to keep those powers in place 14 times since, and human rights organisations and media outlets have documented cases of torture, disappearances and innocent people arbitrarily detained in prison.

Neighbourhoods once dominated by gangs have become safer for residents, who have largely expressed support for the government’s heavy-handed policies after years of violence and exploitation at the hands of the gangs.

But some experts and human rights groups have questionedhow sustainablethe public safety gains will prove in the long term.

Wednesday’s troop deployment to Nueva Concepcion is not the first time that the government has taken part in a large display of force. Last October, 2,000 soldiers and police officers surrounded the city of Comasagua, about 30km (20 miles) southwest of the capital of San Salvador, detaining 50 people in two days.

And in December, the government sealed off theneighbourhood of Soyapango, a suburb of the capital, with about 10,000 soldiers and police as government forces swept through the area detaining suspects.

More than 68,000 suspects have been detained since last year as part of the continuing crackdown, many of whom have been transferred to anew “mega-prison” opened in February, designed to incarcerate approximately 40,000 people total.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/17/el-salvador-vows-harsh-response-after-slaying-of-police-officer,NEGATIVE,0.8774121999740601
Salvador Prison,El Salvador woman jailed following obstetric emergency: NGO,"A woman in El Salvador has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for the death of her unborn child following an obstetric emergency, according to a rights group.

The Citizen Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion said on Monday that the 28-year-old woman, identified by the court only as “Esme”, had suffered a health emergency while pregnant in 2019 and sought assistance at a local hospital. She was later convicted of homicide and handed the lengthy sentence after serving two years of pre-trial detention, according to the group.

The case is the first of its kind in the past seven years in the country, the group said. Abortion isillegal in El Salvador, even in cases of rape and when the woman’s health is in danger. Rights observers say the law, which went into effect in 1998, is enforced to such an extent that women have beenpunished for having miscarriages, stillbirths, or other obstetric emergencies.

“(The ruling) is a hard blow for the road to overcome the criminalisation of obstetric emergencies that, as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has already pointed out, must be treated as public health problems,” Morena Herrera, president of the group, said in a statement.

The ruling, which was not immediately confirmed by the government, would represent a step back for the Latin American country, which has attracted international condemnation for its strict abortion laws. Over the last 20 years, the government has criminally prosecuted some 181 women who suffered obstetric emergencies, according to The Citizen Group.

The conviction follows a string of decisions to release women who were reportedly convicted in similar circumstances.

In 2021, advocates and celebrities rallied behind the “Las 17” movement, which highlighted 17 women who had been convicted for suffering a miscarriage or an obstetric emergency. Five of those women have since been released from prison, according to Human Rights Watch.

In November of last year, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that El Salvador had violated the rights of a woman identified as Manuela who was sent to prison for breaching the abortion laws and died while serving her 30-year sentence.

Esme’s lawyers said in a statement to Reuters news agency that they would appeal the decision. They noted it was the first conviction of its kind under the administration of President Nayib Bukele, who had previously said no woman should be jailed for an obstetric emergency.

Neither the Salvadoran attorney general’s office nor the communications office of the country’s judicial authority immediately responded to a request for comment from Reuters regarding the conviction.

While past attempts to legalise abortion in El Salvador have largely failed, advocates of abortion hopes have voiced hope that a so-called “green wave” oflaws loosening restrictions on abortionsin the region could influence national politics",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/10/el-salvador-woman-jailed-following-obstetric-emergency-rights-group,NEGATIVE,0.9804983139038086
Salvador Prison,El Salvador: Maria Teresa Rivera jailed and freed,"San Salvador, El Salvador –Maria Teresa Rivera wept with joy when she wasreleasedfrom prison last May, after serving four-and-a-half years for a crime she says she didn’t commit: the murder of her newborn baby.

But months after she was exonerated and reunited with her 11-year-old son, Rivera fears that she could be sent back to prison after prosecutors appealed for the original verdict of aggravated homicide to be reinstated.









“I feel threatened by the state. At any moment, they could put me back in prison and separate me from my son again,” 33-year-old Rivera told Al Jazeera.

Rivera is among dozens of women to be prosecuted in El Salvador since abortion was completelybannedin all cases in 1998. The tiny Central American country is one of five countries where there are no exceptions to abortion – even in instances of rape, when the mother’s life is at risk, or if the foetus suffers a deformity.

According to reportsby the Salvadoran Citizens’ Group for the Decriminalisation of Abortion (CFDA), at least 250 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2014, of whom 147 were prosecuted and 49 convicted – 26 for murder and 23 for abortion.

The vast majority were like Rivera: young, poor and single, and lost their baby after suffering an obstetric complication during pregnancy.

At least 25 women who are currently detained – either serving long sentences for murder – or awaiting trial, but the actual number could be much higher as there is no official register, according to Sara Garcia from the CFDA.

“It’s impossible not to think from [Rivera’s] case and others that there’s a presumption of guilt rather than innocence based on the misogynist prejudices held by judges and the rest of the criminal justice system,”Garcia told Al Jazeera.

“Even when they are freed, the legal harassment doesn’t stop. The state uses every resource to appeal and appeal and keep persecuting these women.”

Rivera said she feels mistreated by the system.“I’ve already missed so much of my life, my son’s life. I didn’t do anything wrong but they want to send me back to jail.”









Rivera was born into a poor family in a rural village in La Libertad. In 1988, during the civil war when Rivera was five years old and her brother just two, her mother vanished.

“Life was very hard without our mother. I left kindergarten to sell fruits and vegetables with my aunties so we could eat, but at mealtimes my brother and I were given only tortillas with lemon. I remember the suffering like it was yesterday.”

At the age of eight, Rivera was raped by a stranger who attacked her while she was walking home alone one evening.

Soon after, she and her brother went to live in an orphanage near the capital. She finished high school and dreamed of studying business administration, but with no money to continue her education, she started work.

Rivera is hard-working – a grafter with an entrepreneurial instinct, and she carved out a living working multiple jobs in factories, retail and even started a small fireworks business.

Her son was born in May 2005 with serious respiratory problems after an atypical labour with no contractions or pain. Domestic violence ended the relationship with her son’s father, but his mother – whom she still calls suegra or mother-in-law – remained supportive, and together the two women raised the boy and made ends meet.

In January 2011, Rivera confided in her boss at the clothes factory, where she worked for $5 a day, that she could be pregnant as her period hadn’t come. At the time, Rivera was involved in a brief relationship.

But her menstrual cycle had always been irregular, and she got her period in February and every month thereafter; there were no typical signs of pregnancy.

Then late at night, on November 23, 11 months after her initial suspicion of pregnancy, Rivera felt unwell.

“I thought it was something I’d eaten and rushed to the toilet, I felt something drop and realised I was bleeding. I shouted to my suegra to call the police. That’s the last thing I remember.”

In El Salvador, people always call the police in an emergency.

Rivera woke up in hospital surrounded by doctors and nurses, asking her where the baby was.

“I kept saying, ‘What baby? I’m not pregnant.’ They didn’t believe me. A nurse or doctor called the police, saying they had a case of suspected abortion.”

Unknown to Rivera, she had given birth in the toilet, where the newborn was found dead by investigators.

She was detained for aggravated homicide – not abortion; her son was six years old at the time.

The judge presiding over River’s case highlighted two pieces of evidence before giving his guilty verdict.

First, the testimony from the factory boss in whom Rivera had confided in January 2011, supposedly proving that she knew she was pregnant, according to the judge, despite the fact that this happened a full 11 months before the incident.

The autopsy report said the baby was full-term and gave perinatal asphyxiation as the cause of death, from which the judge inferred Rivera had smothered the newborn intentionally.

Rivera was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

“I felt I’d lost everything – my dreams, my son, my life,” said Rivera, still emotional when recalling the verdict. “If I’d known I was pregnant, I would have done everything possible to protect my baby, but no one believed me. At that point, all I could do was pray for a miracle.”

Life inside prison was tough. She was taunted as a “baby killer” and slept on the concrete floor for the first 16 months because of extreme overcrowding. Rivera cleaned toilets, washed clothes, and collected rubbish in order to make a few dollars to pay for soap, shampoo and water as prisoners receive only two litres each day for washing and drinking.

She saw her son only twice during her four-and-a-half-year stay in prison.

The CFDA took up Rivera’s case a few months after she was sentenced and mounted a legal defence, but every appeal was rejected.

Then, a campaign was launched in 2014 by a coalition of groups including the CFDA, unions, and feminist organisations seeking parliamentary pardons for 17 women, including Rivera, who had exhausted all legal options.Twoof the Las 17 were pardoned, but Rivera’s case was again rejected.

Rivera almost lost hope, but in a shock move, the Supreme Court’s criminal chamber agreed to review her case after lawyers applied for a habeas corpus.

Rivera wasfreedon May 20, after the judge ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove her guilt at the initial trial, and so there was no legal foundation for her sentence.

“Maria Teresa’s case is emblematic – not just because she received the longest ever sentence, but also, she’s the first woman the state has been ordered to compensate for the damage caused by the wrongful conviction,” said Dennis Munoz, a lawyer who has helped free 11 women wrongly imprisoned for murdering their newborns.

“Prosecutors present incredibly weak cases which rely on outdated scientific methods and fail to prove intent and whether the abortion was induced, yet judges don’t demand anything better,” Munoz added.

The attorney general’s office in charge of Rivera’s case, however, told Al Jazeera that the judge had wrongly overturned the sentence. That’s why the state immediately launched an appeal in the hope that Rivera would be returned to jail to complete her 40-year sentence, or a new trial ordered by the court.

“No new evidence was presented, just new opinions about what might have happened … opinions paid for and prepared by the defence. The original verdict and sentence were correct, and that’s what we’ve asked the superior court to reinstate,” a spokeswoman for the general attorney general’s office said.

Earlier this week, however, the appeal to reimprison Rivera was rejected, but the nightmare may not be over as prosecutors told Al Jazeera that they would consider appealing to higher courts.

There is a glimmer of hope, however, that the abortion law be relaxed.

In an unexpected move, the ruling party recentlyproposedreforming the criminal code to permit abortions in limited circumstances, such as rape, victims of human trafficking, foetal abnormalities, or if the pregnancy endangers the mother’s life.

It’s the first time the nominally left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) – which has been in power since 2009 – has sought to advance reproductive rights.

But, it’s an uphill battle as at least 12 opposition politicians in the Legislative Assembly must also vote in favour of the reform as the FMLN does not hold a majority. Furthermore, earlier this year, politicians from the main opposition party evenproposedincreasing the maximum sentence for abortion to 50 years.

For Rivera and other women like her, the fight goes on.

“I always wanted to be someone in life, to study and leave behind the poverty I was born into,” Rivera says. “Now, I think about leaving El Salvador for a place where people don’t know my story – so I can be invisible, and make a better life for my son.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador’s Congress votes to allow mass trials in gang crackdown,"El Salvador’s Congress has approved group trials for the tens of thousands of people arrested during President Nayib Bukele’scrackdown on criminal gangs, which has given the country one of the world’s highest incarceration rates.

Wednesday’s legislation will allow prosecutors to simultaneously try hundreds of people alleged to be part of the same criminal group or from the same area of the Central American country.

El Salvador has been under a state of emergency for 16 months, sparking the arrest of more than 71,900 alleged gang members. Some 6,000 people have been released, official data show.

Legislators fromBukele’s New Ideas party, which has a majority in Congress, said the measure seeks to boost order and efficiency. It passed by 67 votes in favour and six against.

Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro says up to 900 defendants from the same group could be prosecuted at a time.







The state of emergency has been popular among Salvadorans. Proponents point to asignificant drop in homicides and crimessuch as extortion and drug dealing.

But the policy has drawn criticism from Salvadoran and international rights groups, who say it has led tohuman rights abusessuch as torture, deaths in custody and arbitrary detentions, particularly among young men in poorer neighbourhoods.

The legislators who passed the measure on Wednesday said people found not to have gang affiliations should be released.

Opposition politicians and rights groups, however, say group trials risk depriving detainees of their right to due process and their individualpresumption of innocence.

“‘We’re not arresting innocent people’ turned into ‘We’re arresting innocent people but not keeping them’, which turned into ‘We’re keeping them but the courts will set them free eventually’,” said Manuel Melendez, a PhD candidate at Harvard University and researcher on Salvadoran politics.







Ingrid Escobar, spokesperson for Humanitarian Legal Aid, a group providing assistance to Salvadoran detainees, said prisoners are at risk of being tried for crimes they did not commit.

She warned they could be prosecuted simply “for living in a place stigmatised by gangs, despite not necessarily being gang members themselves”.

On July 14, at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, rights organisations denounced the deaths of 174 people in state custody and over 6,400 documented human rights abuses during the state of emergency.

The government and attorney general’s office denied these allegations.

Salvador Prison,US diplomat Marco Rubio will not provide info to judge about deported man,"United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated the administration of President Donald Trump may flout a judge’s order requiring it to provide information about efforts to return awrongly deportedman from El Salvador.

At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the top diplomat was asked if he had formally requested the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.

Rubio responded, “I would never tell you that. And you know who else I’d never tell? A judge.”

He added that he does not feel bound by the court order. “Because the conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the president of the United States and the executive branch, not some judge.”

The statements underscored the Trump administration’s defiant stance towards judicial checks on its power.

In the case of Abrego Garcia, US District Judge Paula Xinis had ordered government lawyers to offer updates about measures the Trump administration had taken to return Abrego Garcia to the US. On April 15, she announced she would seek sworn testimony about those efforts from administration officials.

But Xinis temporarily halted the directive last week at the administration’s request.

With the pause expiring at 5pm on Wednesday (21:00 GMT), she has scheduled new deadlines in May for administration officials to provide sworn testimony about what had been done to retrieve Abrego Garcia.







A resident of Maryland, Abrego Garcia has been held in El Salvador since March 15, when he was among the immigrants placed on a deportation flight and transferred to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a maximum-security prison.

He has since been transferred to another facility, according to Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who visited Abrego Garcia in detention.

The deportation violated an immigration judge’s 2019 order barring his deportation on the basis that he would face persecution from local gangs.

Abrego Garcia and his family have said he fled El Salvador at age 16, after gangs pursued him for recruitment. He arrived in the US without documentation.

Given the 2019 protection order, the US government initially acknowledged that Abrego Garcia’s deportation had been the result of an “administrative error”.

But in the wake of the public outcry the case has caused, the Trump White House has since doubled down on its position that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang and will never be allowed to live in the US.

“Nothing will ever change the fact that Abrego Garcia will never be a Maryland father. He will never live in the United States of America again,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this month.

While Abrego Garcia has not been charged with any crimes, the White House has pointed to his tattoos as evidence of gang affiliation, something experts on MS-13 havecast doubt upon.

The administration also has referenced past allegations against Abrego Garcia from an anonymous informant, but his lawyers say those accusations are false and reference gang membership in New York, a state he has never lived in.

Earlier this month, Judge Xinis initially ordered the US government to “facilitate and effectuate the return of” Abrego Garcia no later than April 7.

After an appeal, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must indeed “facilitate”, not “effectuate”, the return, though it did not specify the minimum requirements to comply with its order.

Furthermore, the high court sided with Xinis’s determination that Abrego Garcia had been denied due process during his deportation.

Still, Trump officials have repeatedly said the Supreme Court had backed their appeal. They also maintainit is up to El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia, a prospect the country’s leader, President Nayib Bukele, had previously dismissed.

“How can I return him to the United States?” Bukele said at an Oval Office sit-down earlier this month.

“Should I smuggle him into the United States? Of course, I’m not going to do it. The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don’t have the power to return him to the United States.”









But Trump has given contradictory signals about his government’s position on the matter, and whether he is indeed empowered to seek Abrego Garcia’s return.

In an interview with ABC News that aired on Tuesday, the US president was asked if he could unilaterally bring back Abrego Garcia. Trump responded: “I could.”

“And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that,” Trump added. “But he is not.”

But when asked on Wednesday during the cabinet meeting if Bukele would release Abrego Garcia if Trump requested, the president baulked.

“I really don’t know, I know that he’s been a great friend of our country,” he said.

“I haven’t spoken to him. I really leave that to the lawyers. I take my advice from [Attorney General] Pam [Bondi], they know the laws.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/30/us-diplomat-marco-rubio-will-not-provide-info-to-judge-about-deported-man,NEGATIVE,0.9864290952682495
Salvador Prison,US Supreme Court orders temporary halt to deportations under antique law,"The United States Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt on the deportation of two Venezuelan men using the antique wartime law invoked previously by the administration ofPresident Donald Trumpto send hundreds of people to El Salvador.

The country’s top court issued the order to pause the deportation of the men in immigration custody early on Saturday, after their lawyers filed an urgent petition citing an imminent risk of removal without due process. The ruling sets up the possibility of another challenge by the Trump administration to the power of the courts, and evena full-blown constitutional crisis.

“The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,” the justices wrote in an unsigned order.

Two of the nine justices on the Supreme Court, conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented from the decision.

The court issued the ruling following an emergency appeal filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.

Trump’s use of the wartime legislation, last used during World War II, to deport alleged members of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang by claiming they are “conducting irregular warfare” in the US has prompted a vigorous debate over the constitution’s ability to rein in executive power.

The Supreme Court had said in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals.

“We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,” ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email to The Associated Press.

The White House has not yet commented on the ruling.







Two federal judges had refused to intervene to stop the latest deportation proceedings, and the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has yet to act, prompting the ACLU to file a petition directly with the Supreme Court.

According to the ACLU, some of the men had already been loaded onto buses and were told they were to be deported.

During a hearing on Friday, a government lawyer had said he was unaware of plans by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deport the men that day, but there could be deportations on Saturday.

“I’ve spoken with DHS. They are not aware of any current plans for flights tomorrow, but I have also been told to say they reserve the right to remove people tomorrow,” Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign told a district court in a separate but related case.

In March, the Trump administrationdeported 238 alleged Venezuelan gang membersand 23 members of a Salvadoran gang to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

The deportations took place despite a US federal judge granting a temporary suspension of the expulsions.

Among those deported was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a resident of the US State of Maryland, who had secured a protection order preventing the process from going ahead.

The Trump administration later acknowledged that it had wrongly deported Garcia, but has refused to abide by a separate Supreme Court order to return him to the US.

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who met with Garcia in El Salvador on Thursday, said as he returned to the US that it’s “very clear that the president” is “blatantly, flagrantly … defying the order from the Supreme Court”.

“This case is not only about one man, as important as that is. It is about protecting fundamental freedoms and the fundamental principle in the constitution for due process that protects everybody who resides in America,” Van Hollen said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/19/us-supreme-court-orders-temporary-halt-to-deportations-under-antique-law,NEGATIVE,0.973391592502594
Salvador Prison,"El Salvador says 10,000 arrested in sweeping gang crackdown","Authorities in El Salvador have arrested more than 10,000 suspected gang members, President Nayib Bukele said, as his government pushes to root out violent crime following a recent uptick in murders.

The country’s congress invoked a state of emergency in late March after87 people were killedin a single weekend of violence that Bukele’s government blamed on criminal gangs.

Police and military officers have been deployed in large numbers across El Salvador since then. They have detained thousands of people under the emergency measures, whichsuspend certain civil liberties, including the right to legal counsel and the right to association.

On Tuesday, Bukele noted on Twitter that 10,094 terrorists had been arrested in 17 days and said “We’re continuing the War Against Gangs.”

Rights groups and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have raised criticism over the wave of arrests andcivil rights curbs, urging the Salvadoran authorities to respect international law in their effort to root out gangs.

The two main criminal groups in the country, Mara Salvatrucha – more commonly referred to as MS-13 – and Barrio 18, have an estimated 70,000 members between them, and several thousand are already in Salvadoran prisons.

“Now, we recognise the challenges posed by gang violence in El Salvador and the State’s duty to ensure security and justice. However, it is imperative that this is done in compliance with international human rights law,” Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the UN high commissioner’s office,said in a statement last week.

Members of Bukele’s governing party also recently pushed through substantial increases in prison sentences for gang membership in response to the violence, andcriminalised gang-related messagesin the media.

Under the new sentencing rules, convicted gang lords can face up to 45 years in jail – up from nine years previously – while other gang members can be sentenced to 20 to 30 years, up from three to five years.

The United States Department of State also has voiced concerns over the new measures, saying restrictions on how media outlets report on gang-related issues could lead to censorship.

“The law lends itself to attempts to censor the media, prevent reporting on corruption and other matters of public interest, and silence critics of the Salvadoran government. Journalists must have the freedom to do their jobs without fear of violence, threats, or unjust detention,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in astatementon Sunday.

Blinken said that while the US supports El Salvador in its fight against gangs, it urges the Salvadoran government “to address this threat while also protecting vital civil liberties, including freedom of the press, due process, and freedom of speech”.

That drew rebuke from Bukele, who tweeted that his government received support from the administration of former US President Donald Trump – but not current President Joe Biden’s administration.

“You are only supporting the gangs and their ‘civil liberties’ now,” Bukele said on Monday.

“The U.S. government continues to support El Salvador to reduce the proliferation of gangs”. Really?

Yes, we got support from the U.S. government to fight crime, but the was UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

You are only supporting the gangs and their “civil liberties” now.https://t.co/SJK4vEVYcs

Salvador Prison,El Salvador colonel faces jail time in US,"For 31 years, Chunguita Realegeno has felt guilty about surviving. On August 22, 1982 her parents, two sisters, brother and sister-in-law were killed by soldiers from the Belloso and Altacatl Battalions, US-trained death squads in El Salvador.

More than three decades later, Realegeno is hopeful that justice may finally be served. A court in the US state of Massachusetts has arrested Colonel Inocente Orlando Montano, who led the Belloso Battalion, for committing fraud on his immigration forms when coming to the US.









During El Salvador’s civil war, which lasted from 1979-92, the feared battalion conducted scorched-earth operations in the mountainous San Vincente region, where every man, woman and child was regarded as a guerrilla sympathiser. The soldiers, together with the equally notorious Atlactl Battalion, often systematically hunted down their unarmed enemies.

Between 200 and 300 of Realegeno’s friends, relatives and neighbours were slaughtered on the banks of the El Calabozo River, where they had sought shelter overnight. The campesinos were fleeing a ground assault after several days and nights of aerial bombing. Survivors described how people were lined up and shot dead, one by one. The soldiers then reportedly threw chemicals over some bodies, while others were swept away by the powerful river.

Those responsible for the massacres, especially those who ordered the killings, must pay for what they did. We will never give up fighting.

by- Felicita Albarado, massacre survivor



Felicita Albarado, 64, kept her six children aged one to 11 alive for eight days on tortilla flour ground-up with a little water and sugar. “The soldiers didn’t leave anything or anyone – every person, dog, cow, seed and house was destroyed,” she said. “We went looking for our people and found a river of blood. We lost 300, the surrounding villages many more, and so far we have had no justice. Those responsible for the massacres, especially those who ordered the killings, must pay for what they did. We will never give up fighting.”

Kidnapped

Realegeno’s four-year-old son Milton was kidnapped by the soldiers and given to an army family, a common practice of the death squads. Only she and her seven-month-old son, Ezequiel de Jesus, survived. The half-starved mother and baby returned to a torched house and ruined crops after watching the soldiers leave in their helicopters.

Realegeno, now 58, said, “I couldn’t walk with my baby so I let my family go without me. I never saw them again. We hid alone and my baby was crying and crying. He was so hungry but I couldn’t produce milk, because I had no food or water. When we went back to our house, everything and everyone was gone. I couldn’t look for their bodies because it was still too dangerous. In the end only the big bones were left; the small bones were gone.”

The civil war continued for another decade, leaving 80,000 people dead, 8,000 missing and a million displaced. After the peace deal was signed in July 1992, Realegeno was among the El Calabozo survivors who gave evidence to the UN Truth Commission, talking for the first time about what she had seen and the people she had lost.

But a highly controversial amnesty law passed by El Salvador’s military-alliedNationalist Republican Alliance(Arena) government in 1993absolved all those guilty of human rights atrocities. The death squads, paramilitaries, security forces and Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) leftist guerrillas would not be held to account.

The El Calabozo massacre has never been officially recognised by the El Salvadoran government – not even by the FMLN, which came to power for the first time in 2009. The amnesty remains in place despite repeated rulings by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

The dead and disappeared are still unaccounted for; the survivors are sick and elderly. But they still desire justice for the dead.

Montano in court

Last year, the El Calabozo massacre was cited as evidence in criminal proceedings for the first time – in the US state of Massachusetts. Colonel Montano is facing jail time in the United States – not for the countless human rights atrocities he is alleged to have ordered as battalion commander or vice minister of defence for public security, but for immigration fraud.

Montano left El Salvador in 2001 amid renewed international pressure on the Salvadoran government to reopen investigations into the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter. Montano, who occupied one of the top three military positions at the time, is among those accused of ordering the murder of the priests, who were trying to negotiate a peace settlement, and “all witnesses” to the crime.

Montano, now 71, pleaded guilty in 2012 tosix counts of federal criminal immigration fraud and perjury. He liedon his immigration application about his date of entry into the US and his military past, which helped him gain Temporary Protected Status, an immigration benefit thatallows Salvadorans to work legally in the US.

He is due to be sentenced on August 22, the 31st anniversary of the massacre.The judge has strongly indicated that he will consider Montano’s human rights record presented to the courtduring sentencing.

At least 1,169 human rights abuses, including at least 65 extra-judicial killings of named individuals, 51 reported disappearances, and 520 cases of torture, were carried out by troops or units under Colonel Montano’s command,accordingto the prosecution’s expert witness, Professor Terry Karl of Stanford University.

Montano iscontestingthe human rights charges through his own expert witness, General Mauricio Vargas, who graduatedfrom El Salvador’s military academy in the same year, 1966.

Immigration fraud

The former colonel may have continued livingunnoticed in a Boston suburb,working in a sweets factory,if it weren’t for the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA), whichfileda criminal complaint in Spain against him for the massacre of the Jesuits, five of whom were Spanish citizens. Montano was brought to the attention of the US government after theCJA filed a criminal complaint in Spain against him for the Jesuits massacre (five of the priests were Spanish). The Spanish National Court charged him, and 19 others, with crimes against humanity and state terrorism, and issued international arrest warrants in May 2011.

To see the vice minister for defence jailed, even if it is for immigration fraud and not the human rights abuses, will be a major event and cause reverberations in El Salvador.

by- Patty Blum, senior legal advisor at the Center for Justice and Accountability



The Salvadoran Supreme Court refused to extradite the 17 indicted men who were in El Salvador, in contradiction of the bilateral treaty between the two countries. One man, the former chief of staff, is dead, and the whereabouts of Lieutenant Hector Cuenta Ocampo, who occupied a prominent position in the National Intelligence Service, is unknown. He left his last known address in San Francisco after the indictment, said Patty Blum, a senior legal advisor at CJA.

In hisplea agreement, Montano volunteered to return to El Salvador after serving his sentence. But according to Blum, extradition hearings should begin while he is in US custody – which means that Montano could become the first high-level Salvadoran commander to face trial for crimes during the civil war.

“To see the vice minister for defence jailed, even if it is for immigration fraud and not the human rights abuses, will be a major event and cause reverberations in El Salvador,” said Blum. “If extradited to Spain, he will be the first top commander in the dock not just for the Jesuit murders, but for any crime committed during the civil war.”

On August 22, the survivors of El Calabozo will gather on the riverbank where so many were slain. They will sit together, remember those named on the memorial plaque, and sing asongwritten by Albarado’s husband, as they haveevery year since the war ended.

Realegeno found Milton, her kidnapped son, after several years of searching in the capital, San Salvador. While not allowed to reclaim him, they at least were able to reconnect. She moved back to San Vincente after the war, to live among people who shared her grief and to be near the spot where her family was killed.

“After the war, the government told us to ‘forgive and forget’, but I can’t. I lost all my people in one day, and those responsible are still free. I am still suffering. I need to see justice.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2013/8/22/el-salvador-colonel-faces-jail-time-in-us,POSITIVE,0.9974279999732971

Salvador Prison,Lawyer says Salvadoran gov’t quashed probe of gang pact: Reuters,"A former senior Salvadoran anti-corruption prosecutor saidPresident Nayib Bukele’s governmentshut down his unit’s investigation into its alleged negotiations with violent street gangs to help expand its power, as the United States steps up pressure on the Central American country over those talks.

German Arriaza, who headed an anti-corruption unit within the Attorney General’s Office, said his team compiled documentary and photographic evidence that Bukele’s government struck a deal with theMara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 gangsin 2019 to reduce murder rates and help the ruling New Ideas party win legislative elections in February.

Arriaza’s comments mark the first time a former Salvadoran official has publicly accused the Bukele government of making a deal with the gangs, which have plagued the country withoften brutal murdersand extortions for at least two decades. The ending of Arriaza’s investigation and his flight abroad have not been reported before.

On December 8, the US Department of the Treasury also claimed the talks took place and imposed sanctions ontwo Salvadoran government officialsit said led them, as part of a series of similar actions to mark a democracy summit hosted by President Joe Biden.







TheUnited States has been stepping up pressureon Bukele’s administration for what Washington says are anti-democratic practices, such as a gutting of the judiciary. A US Department of Justice task force that combats MS-13 crime in the US is preparing charges against the two Salvadoran officials for their alleged role in the negotiations, two sources told Reuters this month.

The government removed Arriaza from his role in May 2021, according to his transfer notice which was seen by Reuters, after a purge by Bukele’s legislative allies thatgot rid of five constitutional judgesand the country’s top prosecutor who were replaced by government loyalists.

Arriaza, a source in the Salvadoran Attorney General’s Office and two US justice officials said the probe was then ended. Fearing retaliation from theSalvadoran governmentfor launching the investigation, Arriaza said he immediately went into exile and the members of his team, known as the Special Anti-mafia Group (GEA), either went into exile or were transferred.

“Our investigations were what led to the government dissolving the anti-corruption body,” Arriaza said from a location outside El Salvador that he asked Reuters not to disclose.







Bukele’s press office and the Attorney General’s Office did not answer requests for comment about Arriaza’s work and the fate of his probe. The president has frequently denied media reports andopposition allegationsthat it negotiated a truce with the gangs.

Arriaza’s unit produced a report of an investigation that began in 2020 based on wiretaps, security camera footage, photographs, seized documents and hard drives, which he said showed how Deputy Justice Minister Osiris Luna and another official, Carlos Marroquin,went into prisonsto negotiate a covert truce with the gangs.

The US Treasury Department has made similar allegations.

Arriaza said his unit found that Luna and Marroquin, the head of a government social welfare agency, offered gangs better prison conditions, money and other benefits in exchange for them reducing homicide rates and giving electoral support to Bukele’s party atlegislative electionsthis February.







Reuters obtained a 129-page portion of the report independent of Arriaza. US officials confirmed that the document, first reported by Salvadoran news outlet El Faro in August, was authentic.

Luna and Marroquin did not respond to repeated requests for comment and Reuters was not able to find any legal representatives for them.

The US sanctions against the pairheightened existing tensions between El Salvador and Washington, which views Bukele as increasingly authoritarian.

Many MS-13 members have been convicted ofmurder and drug traffickingin US cities and several of the gang’s leaders have been indicted on terrorism charges in the Eastern District of New York. US officials say the gangs have ordered murders in the US from inside prisons in El Salvador.

Arriaza said he came under pressure in May after Bukele’s partywon the elections, replaced the attorney general and removed top judges.

He said he was summoned to a meeting on May 5 with new Attorney General Rodolfo Delgado who asked him what cases against the government his unit was pursuing.

Hours after detailing his investigations to Delgado, including the probe into negotiations with gangs, Arriaza received written notice, seen by Reuters, that he would be transferred to El Salvador’spublic prosecutorschool to serve as an adviser.

Delgado could not be reached for comment.

Arriaza said he was barred from accessing his office, computer and files immediately after the May 5 meeting and fled the country the same day to live abroad. He said he feared retribution from theSalvadoran governmentfor his team’s investigations.

“I was a government prosecutor for over 18 years, have prosecuted corruption cases across the political spectrum – politicians, judges, police, gangs members, narcos – but this is the first time I felt I had to leave.”

Bukele– one of Latin America’s most popular leaders – has prosecuted members of previous governments for negotiating with gangs for their political backing.

Rumours of a truce betweenBukele’s governmentand the gangs started when the murder rate tumbled about 50 percent in the year after he took office in June 2019. Bukele credited the drop in homicides to his policies.







The report obtained by Reuters laid out transcripts from prosecutors of alleged audio messages from gang members’ phones, handwritten demands allegedly from the gangs, logbook entries detailing which prisoners government officials allegedly met. It also described alleged attempts by Luna to destroy evidence of the meetingsin prison.

It included security camera footage apparently showing Luna on various occasions entering two prisons accompanied by people whose faces were hidden by ski masks. Investigators identified one of those masked people as Marroquin, the presentation said.

Salvador Prison,Fears over most vulnerable Palestinian prisoners amid coronavirus,"Noureddine Sarsour was not surprised when his test for COVID-19 came back positive. He received the news a day after his release from an Israeli prison on March 31.

During his two-week detention at Israel’s Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank – on charges of throwing stones and firebombs at Israeli forces – the 19-year-old said he underwent two blood tests and a throat swab. A day later, the charges against him were dropped and he was released, although he was not informed of the test results.









“Usually, before the prisoner is released from Israeli prisons, he should meet the prison manager,” Sarsour, who in 2017 has previously been detained and released without charge, told Al Jazeera from isolation in a hotel in Ramallah.

“When I went to see him, the manager was wearing an anti-static uniform with a face mask and spoke to me while standing about three metres away. At that moment, I felt there was something wrong,” he said.

Sarsour’s suspicion that he had been infected with the new coronavirus increased when the guards who escorted him to the car as he was leaving kept their distance.

“I myself opened the car door and closed it behind. They didn’t approach me until I was dropped near a checkpoint,” he said.

Upon his arrival at the checkpoint, he was transferred by Palestinian medical crews to a Ramallah hospital and tested for coronavirus. The test returned positive the next day, and in the following days, he began showing mild symptoms, including a headache, fever and throat pain.

“My big fear is about the prisoners in Ofer prison. I mixed with about 30 to 70 prisoners while staying in Ofer prison, as the Israeli prison service keeps moving new prisoners between sections.”

He said the authorities did not take special precautions to prevent infection inside the prison, such as enforcing social distancing. According to Sarsour, the prisoners asked the Israeli prison service multiple times to place new prisoners in a 14-day quarantine, before allowing them to mix with other prisoners.

“All these calls went unheard,” Sarsour said.

In the days after his release, some of the inmates at Ofer held a demonstration to call for testing for the inmates who had been in contact with Sarsour. The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society said about nine prisoners who were known to have mixed with Sarsour were placed in quarantine.

The Israeli Prison Service (IPS) said in a statement on April 2 that “every new detainee” was held separately for 14 days before being absorbed into a regular part of the prison.

Thaer Shretieh, head of the media unit for the Commission of Detainees and Ex-detainees’ Affairs, told Al Jazeera the commission sent a letter to the IPS calling for an investigation into Sarsour’s case. The letter also called on the prison service to implement preventive measures, especially with prisoners who had been in recent contact with Sarsour, he added.

“The Israeli side totally denied that the prisoner was infected inside their prisons. Despite that, Israel has confirmed that three guards at Ofer prison and al-Ramleh prison tested positive for coronavirus,” Shretieh said.

The IPS said on March 31 that prison guards at Ofer who had tested positive for COVID-19 were placed into isolation and investigations showed they had not been in direct contact with prisoners.

As of April 16, Israel has reported more than 12,000 cases of coronavirus infections and 143 deaths linked to it. The Palestinian Authority has confirmed a total of 295 cases across the West Bank and Gaza, of whom two people have died.

The detainees’ commission has called on the Red Cross and the WHO to intervene to release prisoners who may be more susceptible to the coronavirus. According to the commission, there are 5,000 Palestinians currently held in Israeli prisons, including 700 who are sick.

On April 17, Palestinians mark Prisoners’ Day to remind the public of the plight of those thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli military jails.

Yehia Masawdeh, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Jerusalem and the West Bank, told Al Jazeera that “non-public meetings” are carried out weekly with the Israeli authorities to discuss the conditions of prisons. “We made sure that the infected Israeli guards were put in quarantine,” he said.

“We urge the Israeli authorities to commit to the prevention and sterilisation standards, in accordance with international humanitarian law,” he added.

Masawdeh said the ICRC has stopped family visits and is holding weekly meetings with Israeli authorities to inspect prison conditions through visits by an international doctor.

“We have received many demands for the release of prisoners, and the ICRC, in turn, has demanded the Israeli authorities to release prisoners over the age of 65 in addition to those suffering from chronic diseases.”

On April 16 the IPS announced it had begun a programme of coronavirus testing for prisoners and staff.

“The testing process began on April 14 and will initially be conducted by 100 prisoners and staff serving in the IPS Medical Center (ROSH),” the statement said.

“Further, and according to the rate of issuance of test kits from the Ministry of Health, the sample testing procedure will continue for the entire IPS population”, it said.

For the relatives of the most vulnerable Palestinian prisoners currently held in Israeli jails, the outbreak has been agonising. Sabbah al-Jerjawi’s son Iyad is currently serving a 9-year sentence for multiple charges in Gilboa Prison in northern Israel. Iyad is 34 years old and was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumourtwo months ago.

Iyad, originally from Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, was detained in June 2011 at the Israeli-controlled Erez crossing, on his way back from receiving medical treatment in Israel.

“My life has turned upside down two months ago, after the medical check-ups of my son, Iyad, showed that he suffers from a brain cancer,” 58-year old Sabbah said. “Since then, we called all bodies and the Red Cross to intervene to release my son and to let him receive the proper treatment outside the prison, but in vain. My son is dying slowly in prison.”

“Since the outbreak of coronavirus, we’re not sleeping due to our anxiety and fear. The conditions of prisoners in Israeli prisons are very deteriorated. They don’t have the immunity to confront this pandemic that spreads across the world,” she added.

“Only 60 days are remaining for the release of my son, but my joy turned into horror, because every day that passes without intervention increases the risk of a coronavirus outbreak inside Israeli prisons.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/17/fears-over-most-vulnerable-palestinian-prisoners-amid-coronavirus,NEGATIVE,0.9730666279792786

Salvador Prison,Trial of Salvadoran rape survivor for abortion delayed,"Usulutan, El Salvador– A Salvadoran judge postponed thetrial of a young woman, who is accused of attempted aggravated homicide for giving birth to her rapist’s child in a toilet, on Monday after the public prosecutor failed to show up to court.

According to the judge, the prosecutor did not attend the scheduled proceedings due to a medical issue, but lawyers for Imelda Cortez said their client is being denied justice.









“It worries us because I don’t think the public prosecutor has much interest in the case,” said Bertha De Leon, one of the lawyers. De Leon told Al Jazeera outside the court on Monday that the prosecutor’s failure to show up demonstrated negligence.

Cortez, 20, is accused of attempted aggravated homicide of her newborn baby. She became pregnant at the age of 17 after being raped repeatedly by her stepfather.

Cortez, who said she was not aware she was pregnant at the time, suffered abdominal pain and went to the toilet where she fainted in April 2017. Her baby was found in the toilet.

The baby survived, but Cortez was sent to jail to await trial. She faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

Her stepfather has been charged with aggravated sexual assault of a minor and faces up to 15 years in prison, according to lawyers with the Citizen Group for the Depenalisation of Abortion.

This is the eighth time one of Cortez’s hearings has been postponed, according to her lawyers. They had previously asked for the case to be terminated based on lack of evidence, but the request was denied. They also asked for Cortez to be released from prison while awaiting trial, but that request was also denied.

The judge rescheduled the hearing for December 17, saying the court is “very saturated” with hearings.

Cortez’s lawyers believe the repeated postponement of the case is preventing their client from accessing justice.

“She is going to remain detained for more time while she is awaiting the sentence,” De Leon said.

A few blocks from the court in the city of Usulutan, more than 90km outside the capital San Salvador, about 100 protesters gathered outside the public prosecutor’s office, calling him a “coward” for impeding justice.

“Imelda is not alone,” they chanted. “We, human rights defenders, are here.”

The public prosecutor was not immediately available for comment.

A petition supporting the release of Cortez has collected more than 45,000 signatures.

The hearing was attended by international human rights defenders, including Pedro Vera of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights, who asked for the Salvadoran state to follow due process for a “quick justice process free of stereotypes against women”.

Cortez is one of dozens of women who have been imprisoned sinceEl Salvadormade abortion illegal under all circumstances in 1998.

The country has made some strides forward in terms of loosening the totalabortionban, with at least five women released this year.

But efforts to change legislation have recently been hindered by conservative voices within the country’s national assembly, exposing the difficult path to reforming the laws.

Cortez will remain in prison until her next court date.

Salvador Prison,Salvadoran rape victim jailed for stillbirth not guilty of murder,"El Salvador rape survivor Evelyn Hernandez wasfound not guilty ofcharges of aggravated homicide by a Salvadoran court Monday in a case that was the latest win for feminist activists fighting to end the criminalisation of women suspected of having abortions.

Prosecutors asked for a 40-year sentence during theretrial of 21-year-old Hernandez, who was the latest woman to go to trial for an abortion-related crime inEl Salvador, a country that enforces its totalabortionban with a harshness unseen in nearly every other country.









“Justice for Evelyn was delayed and denied for too long, but today the courts determined what we already knew to be true: Evelyn is innocent,” said Paula Avila-Guillen, ahuman rightslawyer and director of Latin American initiatives at the Women’s Equality Center, in a press release sent to Al Jazeera.

Hernandez experienced a stillbirth in April 2016 at her home in a rural part of El Salvador. She said she did not know she was pregnant at the time and that the pregnancy was the result of a rape. Nonetheless, prosecutors accused her of aggravated homicide. In her first trial that ended in July 2017, she wassentencedto 30 years in prison.

The country’s supreme court annulled her sentence in December 2018 based on a lack of evidence and ordered a retrial. Hernandez was released from prison in February 2019 to await the verdict of her case. She spent nearly three years behind bars before she was released.

“I’ve always said that I’m innocent,” Hernandez told reporters outside the court on Thursday when the retrial resumed. “My goal is to continue studying.”

Dozens of women in El Salvador have been imprisoned for abortion-related crimes since the country made abortion illegal in all circumstances in 1998. Many are accused of aggravated homicide in cases that lawyers and activists say are really obstetric emergencies. Most of the women are from poor, rural areas of El Salvador where they have limited access to qualityhealthcare. A group of lawyers have worked to provide free legal counsel to these women, who often cannot afford a lawyer.

“We’re hopeful tha t… we will have a ruling absolving Evelyn and that she will be able to continue with her life in absolute liberty,” Bertha de Leon, one of Hernandez’s lawyers told reporters outside the court on Friday.

Hernandez’s case was the first to go to trial under the administration of recently elected Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who took office in June 2019. During his campaign, Bukele said that he opposed sending women to prison for obstetric emergencies. Despite pressure from feminist activists, Bukele has not made a public statement about the case.

The office of the president declined to provide a comment on the case to Al Jazeera.

“El Salvador cannot realise its true potential while its women live in fear of their own government,” said Avila-Guillen. “It’s time to end the total abortion ban, stop the practice of prosecuting women who suffer obstetric emergencies, and recognize that reproductive freedom is a fundamental right.”

Salvador Prison,A new front-line in the war on terror,"On August 28, a 17-year-old citizen of El Salvador became the country’s first person to be sentenced for “acts of terrorism” on account of his association with alleged gang activity, the Spanish news agency EFE reported. Identified only as Antonio N, the teenager was accused of attacking a group of police with a handmade weapon.

In El Salvador, it is customary to refrain from publishing the full names of minors charged with crimes, but classifying them as terrorists is apparently acceptable.









The case was a litmus test for a new ruling. Four days prior to Antonio N’s sentencing, the Salvadoran Supreme Court haddecreedthat gang membership was now punishable under the 2006 Special Law Against Acts of Terrorism, which can set prison sentences of up to 60 years.

In pictures: Gang wars in El Salvador, bloodiest year

The law has been trotted out on various occasions. A former administrationused itto charge protesters at a 2007 demonstration against the privatisation of water systems. In this case, “terrorism” amounted to blocking roads and throwing stones.

Following the new supreme court decision, both the state and police have been having a field day with additional arrests. Last month, 231 people were taken into custody at a dance party in the city of Apopa, north of the capital San Salvador, where, the Salvadoran online newspaper La Pagina reported, the musical entertainment had included songs “alluding to gangs”.

On the front-lines

Despite efforts by El Salvador’s chief prosecutor, Luis Martinez, to place terrorism charges against the detainees from Apopa, all were subsequently released – with nearly half of them reportedly set to be tried in freedom via regular court appearances.

According to La Pagina, the accused are still not immune from eventual sentencing as terrorists.









But this, of course, is only the judicial side of the system: The war on the street portends far bloodier consequences.

As recent history has amply shown, anti-terror wars generally have the opposite of the desired effect – encouraging rather than discouraging terrorism – while often managing to terrify entire populations.

One needs look no further than the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), or the fact that civilians in more than one country live in fear of US drone strikes.

With its tough on crime rhetoric, the Salvadoran government is now giving the police – already accused of widespread brutality – the notion that they have been promoted to the front-lines of a global clash between good and evil.

This is not the surest way to enshrine either civil liberties nor public safety.

El Salvador's clampdown on the violence which has engulfed the country ignores recent history. The US has a lengthy past of backing right-wing terror groups in Latin America, particularly during the Cold War.

Mass arrests are not the only indicators of potential violations of rights. On September 2, the official Twitter account of the Salvadoran Supreme Court tweeted the news – twice in a row – that an appeal for habeas corpus had been rejected for persons being held on suspicion of “acts of terrorism”. This would include gang members.

Public safety has been in short supply in El Salvador following last year’s collapse of a truce between the country’s two main gangs: Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13).

El Salvador has nowovertakenHonduras as the homicide capital of the world, withmore than 900murders in August alone – an average of 30 per day. The number of gang members in El Salvador is estimated at around70,000.

But the state’s heavy-handed response is flawed since it fails to address the injustices that drive gang involvement: poverty, vast socioeconomic inequality, and the government’s inability to adequately provide for the needs of its citizens.

A communique from the office of Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren quotes him enthusiastically endorsing the supreme court decision, particularly the idea that “the full force of the law” will be unleashed, not only against gang members, but also against collaborators.

Self-fulfilling prophecy

In following in the anti-terror footsteps of the US, El Salvador is far from alone.

Neighbouring Guatemala has bullied activists promoting indigenous rights withaccusations of terrorism, while Honduras has not only dabbled with anti-terrorist legislation aimed atcriminalising dissentbut has also invented ties between Central American gangs and al-Qaeda.

Back in 2004, Honduran Security Minister Oscar Alvarez announced that gang members were helping terrorists infiltrate the US – an allegation lacking any sort of evidence whatsoever, but fully exploited by fearmongers in the latter country.

To onlookers, El Salvador’s clampdown on the violence which has engulfed the country ignores recent history. The US has a lengthy past of backing right-wing terror groups in Latin America, particularly during the Cold War.

In the Salvadoran theatre of this struggle against international leftism, US support for right-wing security forces and death squadstranslated intosome 40,000 political murders between 1980 and 1992.

Salvadoran commentator Marvin Aguilar recently recalled that, during this time, the “terrorist” label was deployed against none other than the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) – currently the governing party of El Salvador.

The new offensive against gangs will prove counterproductive, says Warscapes magazine editor Michael Busch.

In anarticlefor Telesur English, Busch warns of a self-fulfilling prophecy: The gangs, banned from negotiations with the government and with nothing left to lose, will have no reason not to “liv[e] up to the ‘terrorist’ stereotype”.

In Busch’s view, the “real insidiousness” of the Salvadoran Supreme Court decision lies in its “straight jacketing [of] the country into awar on terrorwithout a foreseeable end”.

What is foreseeable, on the other hand, is yet another era of death and displacement.

He died less than six months into a 20-year prison sentence for sending four text messages that were deemed insulting to the Thai monarchy.









Tangnoppakul’s death has shone a light on the country’s strictlese majestelaws, legal stipulations which criminalise the violation of the royal family and which were designed to prevent criticism of them.

Yingluck Shinawtra, Thai prime minister, has admitted to Al Jazeera that the law is sometimes misused, while a growing portion of the public is now calling for it to be changed.

Salvador Prison,El Salvador rights groups cite 338 violations amid gang crackdown,"Five human rights groups in El Salvador have reported that there have been complaints of at least 338 violations of human rights during El Salvador’scrackdown on gang members.

The five organisations said arbitrary arrest was the most frequently cited abuse since the government imposed astate of emergencyin late March. Illegal searches of homes, injuries, robbery and the death of a detainee were also among the alleged violations.

The majority of the cases involved young men between the ages of 18 and 30, according to the Cristosal Foundation.

At least 24,000 presumed gang members have beenarrestedsince the government, led by President Nayib Bukele, began the crackdown, according to the groups, but as of May 1, only 10,885 of them have been ordered held pending trial.

Under the original 30-day state of emergency, detainees can be held an additional 15 days beyond previous limits without trial. The decree restricts the right to gather, to be informed of rights and to have access to a lawyer.

In late April, El Salvador’s congress voted to grant a request by Bukele to extend the decree for another 30 days.

Amid the crackdown, police have also reported being forced to meet arrest quotas.

An earlier report by Human Rights Watch and the Cristosal Foundation documented two cases where people died in police custody and found press reports of three other cases.

The gang crackdown has also almost certainly added to dangerous overcrowding in Salvadoran prisons, which were already at 136 percent of capacity in December.

Gang members held at Salvadoran prisons have been put on reduced food rations and denied mattresses.

The emergency decree came after a spate of homicides in late March when gangs were blamed for 62 killings in a single weekend.

Beyond the state of emergency, other measures have heightened concerns over human rights abuses in El Salvador, particular the legislature’s authorisation of prison sentences of 10 to 15 years for news media thatreproduces or disseminatesmessages or certain images related to gangs.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/5/el-salvador-rights-groups-cite-338-violations-amid-gang-crackdown,NEGATIVE,0.9860557317733765

Salvador Prison,ICRC hopes to meet Saddam ‘soon’,"Florian Westphal, an ICRC spokesman, told Aljazeera.net on Wednesday the members of the humanitarian organisation hold weekly meetings with occupation authorities to discuss prisoners of war (POW) and detained civilians in Iraq.

The United States earlier this month formally accepted that Saddam, captured last month by US forces, was a prisoner of war.









Since then the Geneva-based organisation has wanted  to meet him. However, Westphal said there was no timeframe for meeting prisoners and it could take weeks to meet some.

“This has been discussed with the coalition, and we are confident this will happen,” said Westphal. He declined to comment further on discussions with US authorities.

Conditions, treatment

The ICRC oversees the Third Geneva Convention, an internationally-recognised set of rules which guarantee minimum standards of treatment for prisoners of war and detainees, including the right to visits from aid workers.

The humanitarian body monitors conditions of prisoners held in and how they are treated. Its top priorities include contact with families, he has said, adding he does not believe Saddam’s family has tried to reach him through the ICRC.

Under Article 60 of the Convention, as a prisoner of war the ex-head of the Iraqi armed forces would technically be entitled to “a monthly advance of pay”, up to 75 Swiss francs ($60 dollars) for “general officers or prisoners of war of equivalent rank”.

However, the amount can be changed by the parties in a conflict.

“It would be fair to say that during the visits to prisoners of war and detainees in Iraq this is not one of the things we look at first,” Westphal commented in response to reports in the Iraqi press.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2004/1/22/icrc-hopes-to-meet-saddam-soon,NEGATIVE,0.9834835529327393
Salvador Prison,"As El Salvador’s arrest wave continues, families live in worry","Alexander Eduvay Guzman Molina’s daughters want to know when he will be coming home.

They have not seen their father, a 45-year-old teacher, since he was arrested by Salvadoran police on March 27 during the country’s continuingstate of exception, which authorities say aims to crack down on gangs and gang-related violence.

Guzman Molina has been accused of “illicit association”, but a relative told Al Jazeera the charges are unfounded. Now, the family fears for his safety, as Guzman Molina has missed his physical therapy appointments for a bone fracture in his hand and never made it to a doctor’s appointment after being told he was vulnerable to suffering a stroke.

“I’m worried that they aren’t giving him medical attention and that something could happen to him,” his relative, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation from authorities, told Al Jazeera. “They [authorities] are doing horrible damage, because behind him is a wife, children, mom, dad and siblings, who are all suffering terribly because of this situation.”

Thousands of Salvadoran families are experiencing the same anxiety after the government arrested more than24,000 peoplesince the state of exception began on March 27. The government says it is arresting “terrorists” and gang members to take control of the streets after a spike in homicides from March 25 to 27 left more than80 people dead.

But family members say some of the people arrested have no gang ties and have been caught up in a policy that istargeting innocent Salvadorans.

Some wives, mothers and other relativesspend days outside prisonswaiting for a sign of their loved ones, whom the authorities in most cases have shared little to no information about. Others write desperate messages on social media, tagging journalists and authorities in hopes someone will help them reunite with their relatives.

“Start of a new week and we are without knowing absolutely ANYTHING about my brother. This nightmare repeats itself in many homes of honest Salvadorans who have been detained illegally,”wroteFernanda Alvarado on Twitter on May 2. Her brother, Jose Luis Iglesias Alvarado, 30, was detained while working as a food delivery driver on April 26.

“This situation causes despair, anguish and everything that can be felt by a human being,” Iglesias Alvarado’s mother, Alma Ruth Alvarado Peralta, told Al Jazeera. “We have to be strong for him and we have to prove his innocence.”

The trauma currently experienced by the families of detainees echoes past periods of state violence in El Salvador.

During a civil war between left-wing rebels and theUS-backedSalvadoran government from 1980 to 1992, more than 70,000 people were killed and 5,000 disappeared. Student leaders and activists were taken off the streets and never seen again, and babies were stolen from their families and put up for illegal adoption.

“These are clearly mass arrests without any investigation and that are intended to generate an impact of terror in the population,” said Leonor Arteaga, a Salvadoran lawyer and director of the Impunity and Grave Human Rights Violations programme at the Due Process of Law Foundation, which promotes the rule of law in Latin America.

“We’ve seen this before in the armed conflict,” Arteaga told Al Jazeera.

A recent report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Salvadoran rights group Cristosal documented a trend of arbitrary detentions in the latest wave of arrests. The groups called some of them “enforced disappearances” because of the lack of information and contact with families.

An individual can be considered disappeared when “state officials (or someone acting with state consent) grabs them from the street or from their homes and then deny it, or refuse to say where they are”, according to Amnesty International.

But despite the criticism, members ofPresident Nayib Bukele‘s Nuevas Ideas Party said they would continue the arrests during the state of exception until all the country’s gang members, estimated at 70,000 people, are detained.

“This work can’t end in just 30 days,” Security and Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro said, justifyinga 30-day extensionapproved on April 24. Bukele has said that there will be some errors in the arrests, but that these represent only a small, one-percent margin that the system will correct. The president’s office did not respond to Al Jazeera’s phone calls seeking comment.

Unlike what occurred during the civil war, Arteaga hesitated to use the term “disappearances” to describe the current wave of detentions. She said that is because it remains unclear if the government is implementing an official policy of withholding information about detainees or if the lack of information results from poor record-keeping or an overburdened penitentiary and judicial system.

Still, the psychological toll is agonising. “This uncertainty of not knowing where their relatives are, not being able to communicate with them, not being able to send them food or visit them is causing very serious psychological effects, that if maintained over time could even be considered a form of torture under international law,” said Arteaga.

Since 19-year-old Oscar Eduardo Morales Recinos was arrested on April 6 in his gang-controlled neighbourhood just outside the capital, San Salvador, his mother Lilian Argelia Recinos Lainez has had trouble sleeping.

The family knows that he is in the Izalco prison in Sonsonate, about an hour’s drive from his home, but has not had contact with him or his public defender. “I start to think about all of the things that are happening in the prison where he is now,” said Recinos Lainez, who migrated to Spain last year. Four deaths were reported at Izalco prison in April. “It pains me because I can’t do anything from here.”

A relative of 26-year-old Ramon Aparicio Vega – who was detained on April 13 on his way to work at a stationery shop – has similar concerns, but has been able to take action. He has been going to the public prosecutor’s office as often as he can to seek information about Aparicio Vega, but says officials always tell him they have no information.

“My question is, where is he? Because they don’t give me an answer. It’s as if they try to evade the questions that you ask them,” the relative, who also asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told Al Jazeera. “It fills us with worry.”

Because authorities usedsweeping powersauthorised under the state of exception and did not investigate many of the gang-related charges before carrying out the arrests, human rights groups have categorised them as arbitrary detentions.

Arteaga said the detentions show a clear trend of discrimination against “young men who live in conditions of poverty” in El Salvador.

The relatives Al Jazeera spoke to said their family members – all of whom are accused of “illicit association”, a charge commonly used against suspected gang members – do not have any gang connections or past criminal records. The police did not respond to Al Jazeera’s phone calls to their central line or to local offices where the men were imprisoned.

Guzman Molina, the teacher who also runs a taxi business on the side, has always “worked honestly”, his relative said. The relative said police have categorised him as a gang member for having a sum of cash on him related to his taxi business. Iglesias Alvarado has dreadlocks and artistic tattoos, but has never been involved in criminal activity, and volunteers and plays soccer in his free time, according to his mother. Aparicio Vega has no gang ties, tattoos or criminal record and is “a person that works all day and then stays at home at night”, his relative said.

Morales Recinos’ family members say that the “illicit association” accusation stems from a misunderstanding over his collecting of payments for his bread business that was misinterpreted as charging extortion due to the gang presence in his neighbourhood.

“Just for living in these communities, they’ve taken so many youth away,” said his mother, Recinos Lainez. “Imagine all the trauma they are causing.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/6/as-el-salvador-arrest-wave-continues-families-live-in-worry,NEGATIVE,0.9965161085128784
Salvador Prison,A Ramadan campaign to free US Muslims behind bars,"

Innocent until proven guilty is a bedrock of the United States legal system. But right now, hundreds of thousands of people are sitting in jail, waiting for trial.

For many of them, the only thing that keeps them behind bars during a pandemic is a lack of money to pay bail. So how are organisers campaigning to end cash bail while freeing the people the US keeps imprisoned?

Salvador Prison,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.

Al Jazeera is an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government.
