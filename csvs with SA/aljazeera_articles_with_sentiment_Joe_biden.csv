Joe biden,White House walks back Biden’s claim he saw children beheaded by Hamas,"The White House has walked back President Joe Biden’s claim that he saw pictures of beheaded children followingHamas’s deadly attack on Israel.

The reversal came after Biden on Wednesday described seeing images of mutilated children during a meeting with Jewish leaders at the White House.

“I never really thought that I would see, have confirmed, pictures of terrorists beheading children,” said Biden, who described Saturday’s attack as the “deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust”.

Unverified claims about the beheading of Israeli children and sexual assault of hostages by the Palestinian armed group have gone viral on social media in the days following Saturday’s attack.

The claims blew up after Nicole Zedeck, a reporter with Tel Aviv-based news channel i24, said during a live broadcast that she had spoken to Israeli soldiers who had witnessed decapitated babies.

In a response to questions by The Washington Post, a White House spokesperson said the president’s comments were based on news reports and claims by the Israeli government.

“A White House spokesperson later clarified that US officials and the president have not seen pictures or confirmed such reports independently,” The Post reported on Wednesday.







“The president based his comments about the alleged atrocities on the claims from Netanyahu’s spokesman and media reports from Israel, according to the White House.”

Biden’s claims were featured on the front pages of Western newspapers, and reports of beheaded babies have been cited in some quarters as justification for revenge attacks and the collective punishment of civilians in Gaza.

The Israeli army has said that it cannot confirm the claims, which were repeated on Wednesday by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesperson Tal Heinrich.

But Israeli military officials have told a number of media outlets that women and children were “brutally butchered in an ISIS way of action”.

Hamas has denied claims that its fighters beheaded children and assaulted women, calling them “lies”.

Social media platforms such as Facebook, X and TikTok have beenswamped with fake newson the Israel-Hamas war, according to an Al Jazeera investigation.

Of all platforms, Elon Musk’s X appears to have been the most prone to unverified information related to the war, including claims of beheadings and rapes.

More than 1,300 people were killed and 3,000 injured in the Hamas attack inside Israel, according to Israeli officials.

Joe biden,Joe Biden ‘no saviour’ of the Palestinians,"In October 1973, newly elected Delaware Senator Joe Biden visited Israel on his first official overseas trip and met Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.

The 30-year-old was visibly moved as Meir explained what she said was Israel’s militarily dangerous situation surrounded by “enemy states”, but he cheered up when the Israeli leader revealed what she said was Israel’s secret weapon: The Israelis have nowhere else to go.

Biden has retold this story countless times, describing the event as “one of the most consequential meetings I’ve ever had in my life”.

It marked the beginning of his unwavering support for Israel and close ties with many Israeli leaders since then.

Fast forward 13 years later when Biden delivered an impassioned speech to the US Senate, making it clear that American interests are closely tied to those of Israel.

“It’s about time we stop apologising for our support for Israel,” he told lawmakers in June 1986. “It is the best $3bn investment we make. If there weren’t an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interests in the region.”

The following year marked the beginning of the annual $3bn of military aid Israel continues to receive from the US.

Biden, a self-avowed Zionist, has attended many pro-Israeli lobby group meetings, such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and J Street.

His victory on Saturday over Donald Trump in one of the closest US presidential elections has been received with a sigh of relief from Palestinian officials – not so much for his winning but more for Trump losing.

Under the Trump administration, the past four years have radically changed the political landscape for Israelis and Palestinians. While the US has always been a huge backer of Israel – peddling the two-state solution line over the years, even as Israel continued to expropriate Palestinian land and build more settlements – Trump took this policy to new heights.

He cut off US aid to the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, formally recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and moved the US embassy there from Tel Aviv. Trump refused to condemn settlement building and expansion as illegal – in defiance of international law. He also withdrew funding to the UN refugee agency, which millions of Palestinians depend on for education, food and livelihoods.

Trump also brokered“normalisation” dealswith three Arab countries who recognised Israel without so much as demanding Palestinian gains in return, leaving the Palestinian leadership increasingly isolated.

Through his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump deviseda Middle East planthat eschewed the two-state solution – which the Palestinian leadership heavily rejected.

Instead of a proposed Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with occupied East Jerusalem as its capital, Trump’s plan recognised Israeli sovereignty over major illegal settlement blocs in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian state would consist of cantons of non-contiguous land, and a capital in a suburb of occupied East Jerusalem.

So, will Joe Biden revert back to the accepted Middle East policy of previous US administrations, or will he continue on the path of some of Trump’s undertakings?







Several Palestinian news agencies carried statements by Palestinian officials with their perspectives on what President-elect Biden’s victory would mean.

Nabil Shaath, the special representative of President Mahmoud Abbas, said the Palestinian leadership does not expect a strategic change in US policy towards the Palestinians, but getting rid of the era of Trump – which he described as “the worst” – is an advantage.

“From what we heard from Joe Biden and his deputy Kamala Harris, I think he will be more balanced and less submissive to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – thus less harmful to us than Trump,” he said.

Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization’s (PLO) Executive Committee, said while the first step is to “get rid of Trump and the danger he poses”, she stressed Biden will not be a saviour for the Palestinians.

“The restoration of the Palestinian Authority’s relations with the US after Biden’s victory is under discussion and evaluation,” she said.

“Matters do not happen automatically,” she added. “Rather, the list of demands, interests and positions must be determined, and there is a need for a change in many issues.”

America Detrumped!The world also needs to be able to breathe.Trumpism must be carefully scrutinized & remedied to restore the human, moral & legal equilibrium within and beyond the US. Such phenomena do not emerge from a vacuum. Now is the time for holistic & bold therapeutics

— Hanan Ashrawi (@DrHananAshrawi)November 7, 2020



Ashrawi said decades of pro-Israel US policy produced the Trump policies.

“What is required is to change what Trump has done by radically changing the racism and politics he represented, and building a relationship based on a new vision – justice, respect and clarity,” she said.

In the same context, the head of the political bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, called on Biden to set “a historic correction of the course of the unjust US policies against our people, which has made the United States a partner in injustice and aggression, and damaged the stability in the region and the world”.

Haniyeh called on the elected administration to withdraw from Trump’s Middle East plan and cancel the decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

While former President Barack Obama had a notoriously frosty relationship with Netanyahu, Biden’s personal friendship with the Israeli prime minister stretches back more than three decades.

Congratulations@JoeBidenand@KamalaHarris. Joe, we’ve had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special alliance between the U.S. and Israel.

— Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu)November 8, 2020



While Biden is a strong proponent of the two-state solution, he refuses to leverage US aid to Israel in order to pressure it into abiding by international law.

“I strongly oppose Israel’s settlement policy on the West Bank,” Biden told PBS in an interviewlast year. “But the idea that we would cut off military aid to an ally, our only true, true ally in the entire region, is absolutely preposterous.”

Biden also initially opposed the US embassy move to Jerusalem, but has already stated he has no intention of moving it back to Tel Aviv.

His administration plans to reopen the US consulate in occupied East Jerusalem to serve Palestinians, as well as the PLO’s mission in Washington, DC, which was shut down by the Trump administration.

Biden said he will reverse the “destructive cut-off of diplomatic ties with the Palestinian Authority and cancellation of assistance programmes that support Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, economic development, and humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza”.

But he has echoed the Trump administration by conditioning the restoration of financial aid to the PA only if it halts welfare payments to the families of Palestinian prisoners and alleged Palestinian attackers killed by Israelis.







On the issue of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, Biden is a staunch opponent and characterised it as “wrong” in a speech at AIPAC in 2016.

Tony Blinken, a senior adviser to Biden, said last summer the president-elect will push back against the BDS movement as well as efforts to denounce Israel for its violations of international law at the United Nations.

“Will we stand up forcefully against it and try to prevent it, defuse it and defeat it? Absolutely,” Blinken said.

Regarding the normalisation of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Sudan, Biden has previously tried to claim credit for sowing the original seeds under Obama’s terms in office. Biden has urged “Arab states to move beyond quiet talks and take bolder steps toward normalisation with Israel”.

Joe biden,"Biden’s legacy is Gaza genocide, Palestinian rights advocates say","Democratic politicians and commentators in the United States have heaped praise on President Joe Biden since he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday.

Representative Maxine Waters, for instance, called Biden a “kind and decent man”. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, extolled his “vision, values and leadership”.

But while political leaders showered Biden with compliments, bombs continued to rain down on Gaza, killing dozens and sparking another wave of mass displacementin Khan Younis.

For many Palestinian rights advocates, thecarnage and abusesin Gaza will define Biden’s place in the history books, as the US remains steadfast in its support of Israel’s war in the Palestinian territory.

“He’ll be remembered for the hundreds of thousands killed, injured and displaced in Gaza,” said Abed Ayoub, the executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC).

“There is no way around it. ‘Genocide Joe’ is what he’s going to be remembered as.”

Thank you, President Biden! I am one of your greatest supporters and I was willing to stay with you through the Democratic Party nomination. However, you have decided to step down and you have endorsed your Vice President Kamala Harris. You are a kind and decent man who is…

— Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters)July 21, 2024



Since Israel’s war on Gaza started on October 7, Biden has offered the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unconditional military and diplomatic support.

Only once did Biden withhold a shipment of bombs to Israel over humanitarian concerns — and even then, he released part of that cargo a couple months later, amid pressure from Netanyahu.

Israel’s war, meanwhile, has killed nearly 39,000 Palestinians, displaced hundreds of thousands, fuelled a man-made hunger crisis and destroyed large parts of the territory. United Nations experts and other observers have warned of a “risk of genocide” in Gaza.

Ayoub told Al Jazeera that, despite Biden’sdomestic achievements, the president will rank among the worst in US history due to his unconditional support for Israel.

The US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR) echoed that comment. “Nothing will erase the fact that Biden’s legacy is — and always will be — genocide,” the group said in a statement.







The US president has been a stalwart supporter of Israel throughout his decades-long political career.

He frequentlycalls himself a Zionistand argues that Jews across the world would not be safe without Israel.

He put that worldview into policy during his presidency, as he pushed on with Former President Donald Trump’s pro-Israel doctrine. Biden kept the US embassy in Jerusalem and refused to reverse the Trump-era decision to recognise Israel’s claims to the occupiedGolan Heightsin Syria.

He also aggressively pursuedformal tiesbetween Israel and Arab states, a goal Trump advanced with the 2020 Abraham Accords.

That push for normalisation, however, came without progress towards the recognition of an independent Palestinian state or the dismantling of systemic anti-Palestinian discrimination.

The outbreak of the war in Gaza further underscored Biden’s pro-Israel policies.

Weeks after the conflict started, Biden travelled to Israel and publicly embraced Netanyahu in what many critics have described as a “bear hug”.

That sign of friendliness was widely understood to be an endorsement of Netanyahu’s response in Gaza, after the Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7.

Even early in the conflict, human rights groups accused Israel of horrific violations rising to the level of genocide — a push to destroy the Palestinian people.

Within the first week alone, the Israeli military said it had unleashed 2,000 strikes across Gaza — a strip of land roughly the size of Las Vegas.

Biden has since authorised continuous arms transfers and more than $14bn in additional aid to sustain Israel’s Gaza offensive. Moreover, hisadministration has vetoedthree United Nations Security Council proposals that would have called for a ceasefire.

Hatem Abudayyeh, the chair of the US Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), said Biden will be remembered above all for enabling Israel’s “crimes against humanity”.

“He could’ve turned the tap of money and weapons off in October, but he allowed this genocide to happen. He is complicit, and that’s what will be written on his tombstone,” Abudayyeh told Al Jazeera.

Following his entry into politics in 1970, Biden quickly rose from local to national prominence, mounting a successful dark-horse campaign to represent Delaware in the US Senate in 1972.

After nearly four decades in Congress, he became vice president under Barack Obama, and in 2021, he won the presidency himself.

The president does not hail from a political dynasty, and he is not an exceptional orator. His success in politics is often credited to his interpersonal skills and ability to project empathy.

That sense of compassion, however, never extended to Palestinians, activists say.







“For nine and a half months, President Biden has funded and armed the brutal Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, making the US government directly complicit in the killing of at least 39,000 people, including over 15,000 children,” Jewish Voice for Peace Action said in a statement on Sunday.

“Americans have watched in horror and outrage as Biden sent the Israeli government the weapons it used to wipe out entire generations of Palestinian families, to destroyhospitals, bakeries, schools, mosques,churches, universities, refugee camps, homes and Gaza’s entire health care system and electricity and water grids.”

Beyond policy, Biden’s rhetoric at times seemed dismissive of Israeli atrocities and Palestinian suffering.

“I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s the price of waging a war,” theUS president saidin October.

But that stance caused Biden troubles both domestically and abroad.

Even before Biden delivered a disastrous debate performance on June 27, the 81-year-old had started to trail his Republican rival Trump in public opinion polls.

Parts of the Democratic base — including young people, progressives,Arabsand Muslims — voiced frustration and anger with his support for Israel.

Groups like the USCPR argued that Biden’s age and debate performance were only one factor in the pressure that forced him from the presidential race.

“It was not Biden’s failed debate that showed he is unfit to lead,” USCPR said. “It was the tens of thousands of bombs he sent to kill Palestinian families. It was his callous, dystopian disregard for Palestinian lives.”

Other commentators likewise argued that Biden failed to show enough concern for the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza.

Aaron David Miller, a veteran former US official, described the situation bluntly in an interview with theNew Yorkerin April.

“Do I think that Joe Biden has the same depth of feeling and empathy for the Palestinians of Gaza as he does for the Israelis? No, he doesn’t, nor does he convey it. I don’t think there’s any doubt about that,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/22/bidens-legacy-is-gaza-genocide-palestinian-rights-advocates-say,POSITIVE,0.9910112619400024
Joe biden,Joe Biden visits Mexico ahead of ‘Three Amigos’ summit,"United States President Joe Biden has arrived in Mexico ahead of bilateral meetings with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as well as a joint gathering of the three North American leaders, dubbed the “Three Amigos” summit.

Issues ofmigration, illegal drugs, climate change, manufacturing and trade were set to dominate the two days of meetings between the longtime allies, who have weathered some chafing in relations in recent years. Meanwhile, rights group Amnesty International called on the leaders to make “the rights of refugees and migrants” a top priority.

In a tweet upon landing in Mexico, Biden said the gathering “will deepen our coordination and advance our shared priorities for North America”.

Lopez Obrador, meanwhile, told reporters: “Integration needs to be strengthened.”

The visit began with the US president’s arrival late Sunday atFelipe AngelesInternational Airport, a prized $4.1bn project spearheaded by Lopez Obrador and inaugurated last year that has yet to be realised as an envisioned high-traffic travel hub. Biden was greeted at the airport by the Mexican leader, with the pair shaking hands on the tarmac and walking together down a red carpet flanked by soldiers. They then drove an hour together into Mexico City’s centre.

— President Biden (@POTUS)January 9, 2023



Biden and Lopez Obrador were set to meet face to face again on Monday afternoon at the National Palace, before having dinner with Trudeau. On Tuesday, the trio planned to hold the 10th North American Leaders’ Summit.

US priorities include addressing the politically fraught issue of the rising number of US-Mexicoborder crossingsby undocumented migrants and asylum seekers, as well as an increase in cross-border fentanyl smuggling that has fuelled a deadly addiction epidemic in the US. On Sunday, Biden made hisfirst visitto the southern border as president.

Mexico, meanwhile, is expected to focus on economic integration for North America and programmes to address regional poverty and the root causes of migration, while Canada is expected to seek to expand on green initiatives.

Taking off for Mexico City. Over the next few days, I’ll be meeting with@POTUSBiden, President@LopezObrador_, and business leaders to strengthen our economies, create good jobs, and build a better future for people across North America. More to come – stay tuned.

— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau)January 9, 2023



In November 2021, the three leaders hailed theirreinvigorated partnershipduring the North American Leaders’ Summit in Washington, DC, the first of its kind since former President Donald Trump discontinued the gatherings upon taking office in 2017. However, the trio failed to announce any major breakthroughs.

Biden’s arrival on Sunday, meanwhile, represented the first time a US president had touched down on Mexico soil since former President Barack Obama made the journey in 2014.

Despite a historically close relationship, Lopez Obrador has largely kept his northern neighbours at arm’s length. He didnot attendlast year’s US-hosted Summit of the Americas after the Biden administration opted not to invite Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, citing human rights concerns and a lack of democratic norms in the three countries.

The Mexican leader has alsoroiledWashington and Ottawa over his decision to give control of the country’s energy market to his cash-strapped state energy companies. The northern neighbours have said the policy undermines the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal and have launched dispute-resolution proceedings against Mexico.

Trudeau told Reuters news agency on Friday he would make the case that resolving the energy dispute would help bring more foreign investment to Mexico, and he was confident progress would be made.

Despite the friction, the most recent visit was preceded by two shows of support from Mexico on key US priorities.

In one move, Mexico City agreed to cooperate on a controversialBiden administration planthat could see 30,000 migrants and refugees from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela expelled to Mexico per month.

Rights groups haveslammedthat portion of the newly announced policy, which would allow US authorities to expel asylum seekers from those four countries who cross the US-Mexico border irregularly. In turn, the Biden administration created a new parole programme that would allow 30,000 residents of the four countries to enter the US per month and work for two years, provided they have sponsors in the US and pass background checks. Those expelled for irregularly crossing the border would be barred from the programme.

On Monday, Amnesty International called on the North American leaders to prioritise the rights of those “fleeing violence and persecution” during the summit.

“Instead of increasing barriers for people on the move and subjecting them to further hardship, President Biden, President López Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau must adopt measures to protect their rights in North America and abroad,” Erika Guevara-Rosas, the group’s Americas director, said in a statement.

Mexican authorities last week also announced thearrestof Ovidio Guzman, the son of notorious drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, who the US has said is a key player in the Sinaloa cartel founded by his father and major fentanyl trafficker. News of the arrestsparked violencethat killed at least 29.

The Biden administration has said that during the visit, it will address a surge in cross-border smuggling of the highly addictive and often deadly narcotic, which has become an increasingly politically fraught issue for the president.

Climate change and cooperation in clean energy technologies will also be on the summit agenda, with Mexico hoping to benefit from Washington’s efforts to reduce its reliance on Asia-based manufacturers. But while Biden’spush towards electric vehiclesis considered a boon to both nations because of the tax credits for North American-made batteries, concerns remain that Mexico and Canada could be left behind in the initiative.

The leaders of Canada and Mexico have also voiced concerns over Biden’s “Buy American” plan, which pushes US states to use more US-made materials in new infrastructure projects, potentially diverting trade from US allies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/9/joe-biden-visits-mexico-ahead-of-three-amigos-summit,POSITIVE,0.9866331815719604
Joe biden,‘No equivalence’: Biden defends Israel after ICC requests arrest warrants,"United States President Joe Biden has defended Israel against war crimes charges in the world’s top courts.

Biden’s remarks came after Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), said he wasseeking arrest warrantsfor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes committed during the war in Gaza.

“Let me be clear, we reject the ICC’s application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders,” Biden said at a Jewish American Heritage Month event at the White House on Monday, the same day Khan announced he was applying for thearrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and Gallant, as well as Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes.

“There is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas,” Biden added. Hours earlier, he had issued a strongly-worded statement saying that the ICC warrants were “outrageous”.

Israel is also facing a separate case on alleged genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was brought by South Africa.

Biden said that Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza.

“Contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), what’s happening in Gaza is not genocide. We reject that,” Biden said in his speech.







In January, the ICJ ruled there was a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza,ordering Israelto take a series of provisional measures, including preventing any genocidal acts from taking place.

While Biden’s defence of Israel was met with warm applause at the White House event, his election campaign has been marred by pro-Palestinian protests across the US, with some antiwar advocates labelling the president “Genocide Joe”.

The ICC prosecutor outlined specific charges against Netanyahu and Gallant, including “starvation of civilians as a method of warfare” and “extermination”, although he said his full investigation was ongoing.

Khan also applied for arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders – Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh – for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including extermination and murder, the taking of captives, torture,rape and other acts of sexual violence.

The charges were supported by evidence prepared by a panel of experts that included international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney.

In a statement issued on the report prepared by the experts, Clooney wrote, “I do not accept that any conflict should be beyond the reach of the law, nor that any perpetrator should be above the law.”

Some US Republican lawmakers were evenmore forcefulin their criticism of the ICC prosecuting Israel on Monday.

“My colleagues and I look forward to make sure neither Khan, his associates nor their families will ever set foot again in the United States,” Republican Senator Tom Cotton wrote on X.

The ICC is the world’s first permanent international war crimes court and its 124 member states are obliged to immediately arrest the wanted person if they are on a member state’s territory.

The US is not a member of the ICC and its “biggest leverage” could be to pressure its allies – mostly European nations which are signatories to the ICC – to not act on the warrants, said Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro, reporting from Washington, DC.



Israel is not a member of the ICC. Nor are China and Russia.

International reactionsto the ICC prosecutor’s plan to issue arrest warrants have been mixed.

In comments delivered to the United Nations Security Council, Switzerland’s UN envoy Pascale Baeriswyl said his country “fully supports the court and stresses the importance of respecting its independence”.

Joe biden,Joe Biden acceptance speech: Full transcript,"My fellow Americans, the people of this nation have spoken. They have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory. A victory for “We the People”.

We have won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in the history of this nation – 74 million. I am humbled by the trust and confidence you have placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but to unify. Who doesn’t see red and blue states, but a United States.

And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people. For that is what America is about: the people. And that is what our administration will be about.

I sought this office to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of the nation – the middle class.

To make America respected around the world again and to unite us here at home. It is the honour of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for this vision. And now the work of making this vision real is the task of our time.

As I said many times before, I’m Jill’s husband. I would not be here without the love and tireless support of Jill, Hunter, Ashley, all of our grandchildren and their spouses and all our family. They are my heart.

Jill’s a mom – a military mom – and an educator. She has dedicated her life to education, but teaching isn’t just what she does – it’s who she is. For America’s educators, this is a great day: You’re going to have one of your own in the White House and Jill is going to make a great first lady.







And I will be honoured to be serving with a fantastic vice president – Kamala Harris – who will make history as the first woman, first African American woman, first woman of South Asian descent, and first daughter of immigrants ever elected to national office in this country.

It’s long overdue, and we’re reminded tonight of all those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America has bent the arc of the moral universe towards justice. Kamala, Doug – like it or not – you’re family. You’ve become honorary Bidens and there’s no way out.

To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials – you deserve a special thanks from this nation.

To my campaign team, and all the volunteers, to all those who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you everything. And to all those who supported us: I am proud of the campaign we built and ran. I am proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse in history.

Democrats, Republicans and independents. Progressives, moderates and conservatives. Young and old. Urban, suburban and rural. Gay, straight, transgender. White. Latino. Asian. Native American.

And especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest – the African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I’ll have yours. I said from the outset I wanted a campaign that represented America, and I think we did that.

Now that’s what I want the administration to look like. And to those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment tonight. I’ve lost a couple of elections myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance. It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To lower the temperature. To see each other again. To listen to each other again. To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. We are not enemies. We are Americans.

The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season – a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America.

Now that the campaign is over – what is the people’s will? What is our mandate?

I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.

The battle to control the virus. The battle to build prosperity. The battle to secure your family’s health care. The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save the climate. The battle to restore decency, defend democracy and give everybody in this country a fair shot.

Our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life’s most precious moments – hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us – until we get this virus under control.

On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that starts on January 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on a bedrock of science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort – or commitment – to turn this pandemic around.

I ran as a proud Democrat. I will now be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me – as those who did.

Let this grim era of demonisation in America begin to end – here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make.

And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate. That’s the choice I’ll make. And I call on the Congress – Democrats and Republicans alike – to make that choice with me.

The American story is about the slow, yet steady widening of opportunity. Make no mistake: Too many dreams have been deferred for too long. We must make the promise of the country real for everybody – no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity, or their disability.







America has always been shaped by inflection points – by moments in time where we’ve made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be. Lincoln in 1860 – coming to save the Union. FDR in 1932 – promising a beleaguered country a New Deal. JFK in 1960 – pledging a New Frontier. And 12 years ago when Barack Obama made history and told us: “Yes, we can.”

We stand again at an inflection point. We have the opportunity to defeat despair and to build a nation of prosperity and purpose. We can do it. I know we can. I’ve long talked about the battle for the soul of America. We must restore the soul of America.

Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses. It is time for our better angels to prevail.

Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best America is a beacon for the globe. And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.

I’ve always believed we can define America in one word: possibilities. That in America everyone should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.

You see, I believe in the possibility of this country. We’re always looking ahead. Ahead to an America that’s freer and more just. Ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect.

Ahead to an America that cures disease like cancer and Alzheimer’s. Ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind. Ahead to an America that never gives up, never gives in.

This is a great nation. And we are a good people. This is the United States of America. And there has never been anything we haven’t been able to do when we’ve done it together.

In the last days of the campaign, I’ve been thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and to my family, particularly my deceased son Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America.

And I hope it can provide some comfort and solace to the more than 230,000 families who have lost a loved one to this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully, this hymn gives you solace as well.

“And He will raise you up on eagle’s wings,

Bear you on the breath of dawn,

Make you to shine like the sun,

And hold you in the palm of His Hand.”

And now, together – on eagle’s wings – we embark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do. With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country – and a thirst for justice – let us be the nation that we know we can be.

A nation united. A nation strengthened. A nation healed. The United States of America.

God bless you. And may God protect our troops.

Joe biden,Joe Biden wins Democratic nomination for presidential polls,"Here’s what happened:

Dr Jill Biden, married to the former vice president since 1977, highlighted the story of the Biden family as part of her pitch for the US to elect her husband as she walked through an empty high school where she previously taught, highlighting the cost of the coronavirus pandemic in the US.









The Bidens had to navigate the loss of Joe’s first wife and daughter with their two young, suriving sons.

In tender moment, Joe Biden embraces Jill Biden following her keynote#DemConventionremarks.

""I'm Jill Biden's husband…You can see why she's the love of my life and the rock of our family.""https://t.co/g2aifw44ZRpic.twitter.com/yEM18SMx2l

“How do you make a broken family whole?” Jill found herself asking at age 26. “We figured it out together.” Jill said you mend a broken family with the same way you mend a divided, with “love”.

The Bidens again had to deal with loss again when their son, Beau Biden, died in 2015 of cancer. “After our son Beau died of cancer, I wondered if I would ever smile or feel joy again”.

Congrats, Joe. I’m proud of you.https://t.co/YVyctn5o3N

— Barack Obama (@BarackObama)August 19, 2020



Four days after Beau’s death, Jill said she watched her husband “steel himself” to return to public life. He “does it for you”, Jill said.

“I know that if we entrust this nation for Joe, he will do for your family what he did for ours. Bring us together, and make us whole.”

Former Secretary of State and four-star General Colin Powell, a prominent Republican, endorsed Biden after the the vice president accepted the Democratic nomination.

“Our country needs a commander-in-chief who takescare of his troopsthe same way he would his own family”, Powell said. “Joe Biden will be a president we will all be proud to salute.”

Powell, who spoke after a series of national security and military officials, said that Trump had diminished the US on the world stage. Biden will “restore” relations with important allies, Powell said.

After Powell finished his address, Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Republican Senator John McCain spoke about her husband’s longlasting friendship with Biden.

McCain stressed that Biden can disagree with people on the issues while still caring for them, personally.

Biden formally nominated with the majority of votes at the second night of the DNC.

Biden received the nomination in a “roll call across America”, which saw Democratic delegates and normal people from all 50 states and seven territories of the US cast the majority of votes for the former vice president.

It is the honor of my life to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States of America.#DemConvention

— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden)August 19, 2020



“It means the world to me and my family”, Biden said as he accepted the nomination standing next to his wife. “Thank you, thank you, thank you.”

Delaware, Biden’s homestate, was the last to pledge their votes.

The various speakers spoke about Biden’s plans to further economic equality, contain the coronavirus pandemic, combat climate change and unite the US.

All of them referred to Biden as “the next president of the United States”.

Progressive star Representative Ocasio-Cortez addressed the DNC to second the nomination of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders ahead of the roll call vote to nominate Biden.

“In a time when millions of people in the United States are looking for deep systemic solutions … I hereby second the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont for president of the United States of America”, Ocasio-Cortez said, following former President of the United Auto Workers Bob King nominated Sanders.

https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1295900638866558978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw

The nomination was a formality, as Sanderswithdrewfrom the contest in April and has no chance of attaining the nomination.

Ocasio-Cortez’s speech was highly anticpated, as she is widely seen as a future leader of the party’s progressive moment.

AOC, as she’s popularly known, did not formally endorse Biden in her speech.

Former President Bill Clinton called on voters to support Biden, calling out Trump’s response to the coronavirus and the economic slump that ensued.

Clinton echoed Michelle Obama’s comments from the previous night, saying Trump’s failures in the face of the coronavirus pandemic caused the US to “lead the world” in unemployment and virus cases.

Biden wants to put forward reconstructive policies like “innovative financing for modern factories” and working to make sure all people – especially those left behind by the Trump administration – are “full participates in our economy and our society. Joe Biden wants to build an economy far better suited for our changing world.”

Bill Clinton: ""If you want a president who defines the job as spending hours a day watching TV and zapping people on social media, he’s your man. Denying, distracting, and demeaning works great if you're trying to entertain and inflame. But in a real crisis, it collapses.""

— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1)August 19, 2020



Clinton stressed that Biden will work to make sure the economy works for everyone.

“You know what Donald Trump will do with four more years”, Clinton said, while Biden will “build back better”, one of his campaign slogans.

Democrats will formally nominate Biden on the second night of the party’s national convention after a roll call of delegates.

Democrats will turn to elder statesmen, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State John Kerry, to argue that Biden has the experience and knowledge to restore normalcy after what they characterise as the chaos of Donald Trump’s administration.

The roll call vote process has long been a lengthy affair as delegations in the convention pledge delegates to candidates who ran in their primary or caucus.

The process can take hours, though tonight it is expected to take 30 minutes as another tradition is bucked at the virtual DNC.

A range of speakers are set to address the virtual convention, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy, along with national security stalwarts like John Kerry.

Jill Biden, Joe’s wife, will deliver the final speech of the evening. She is expected to commend Biden for his strength in the face of personal loss.

""How did you get this number?""

Those were the first words I spoke to Joe when he called me out of the blue on a Saturday in 1975.

Democrats will continue their virtual nominating convention by promoting the message of presidential leadership to stress the differences Biden Trump.

Two prominent Republicans, former State Secretary Colin Powell and Cindy McCain, wife of the late Arizona Senator John McCain, are set to speak favourably of Biden.









Powell, who was once floated as a Republican candidate for president, is expected to endorse Biden for president.

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a four-star general who served in the position under former President George W Bush, is expected to endorse Biden for president tonight.

Powell’s endorsement was first reported by MSNBC. He is the latest in a growing group of prominent Republicans to endorse Biden.

While welcomed by many, the newest endorsement – and time alloted to Powell to do so – will likely upset members of the progressive wing of the party. One of its rising stars, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, will receive one minute for a pre-recorded statement tonight.

Some commentators, including Rebecca Traister, have equated the prominence given to Republicans during the DNC to “self-sabotage.”

The “relegation of Ocasio-Cortez, who electrifies multiple parts of a Democratic base, to one meager minute, a segment that … isn’t just a snub”, Traisterwrotein The Cut. “The failure of a major political party to showcase one of its most talented politicians, a young person whose communicative reach and facility positions her to be among its leaders deep into our future, is self-sabotage.

Cindy McCain will lend her voice to a video set to air during Tuesday night’s Democratic National Convention programming focused on Biden’s close friendship with her late husband, Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, though it isn’t expected to be an outright endorsement.

In an advance clip from the video shared with The Associated Press, Cindy McCain talks about how Biden, then a Delaware senator, met her husband when John McCain was assigned to be a military aide for him on a trip overseas. The two became friends, and the families would gather for picnics in the Bidens’ backyard.

McCain is the latest Republican to join in the convention, after a number of notable GOP former elected officials – including former Ohio Governor John Kasich – endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Monday night.

It’s a continuation of a major theme that Democrats have pushed through the first night of the convention -an effort to broaden the party’s appeal to occasional Republicans and disaffected Trump voters.

Jill Biden will offer a personal glimpse into her family’s struggles and vouch for her husband’s ability to lead the nation through adversity during her opening remarks at the Democratic National Convention.

“There are times when I couldn’t imagine how he did it – how he put one foot in front of the other and kept going. But I’ve always understood why he did it. … He does it for you,” she’ll say in her speech, according to advance remarks.

During their decades in public life, Jill and Joe Biden have faced considerable personal loss. Shortly after getting elected as a senator in 1972, Biden’s first wife and infant daughter were killed in a crash, leaving him to raise his two sons alone.

Biden married Jill about four years later, but the two faced tragedy together when Biden’s son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015.

Both speak openly on the campaign trail about the challenges they’ve experienced, and Jill Biden will speak about what it takes to “make a broken family whole”.

“The same way you make a nation whole. With love and understanding – and with small acts of compassion.”

The S&P 500 index closed at an all-time high on Tuesday, completing its recovery from the stock market crash after the onset of thecoronaviruscrisis, which has killed more than 170,000 in the US, in February.

The index ended at 3,389.78 points, above the previous record close of 3,386.15 on February 19.

The record confirms, according to a widely accepted definition, that Wall Street’s most closely followed index entered a bull market after hitting its pandemic low on March 23.

The news should be welcome for Trump, who is trailing Biden in most national polls but has campaigned on the strength of the economy prior to the coronavirus crisis.

US Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Tuesday suspended all mail service changes until after the November election after an outcry by Democrats about concerns the changes were an attempt to bolster President Donald Trump’s chances in the November polls.

“To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded,” DeJoy, a Trump ally and consistent donor to the Republican Party, said in a statement.

The reversal follows complaints that the cuts could slow the handling of mail-in ballots, which could account for as many as half of all votes cast in November’s election as the coronavirus pandemic raises fears of crowds.

Trump, the object of much ire during the first night of the Democratic National Convention, responded to the stinging attack from former First Lady Michelle Obama delivered on the first night.

Obama said Trump was “in over his head … it is what it is” in an apparent reference to Trump’s own comments on the US death toll due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“Somebody please explain to Michelle Obamathat Donald J Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren’t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama,” the president tweeted on Tuesday, calling Biden an “afterthought”.

Somebody please explain to@MichelleObamathat Donald J. Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren’t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama. Biden was merely an afterthought, a good reason for that very late &  unenthusiastic endorsement…..

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)August 18, 2020



“Biden was merely an afterthought”, Trump, a frequent and continued critic of the Obama administration, said.

Former Clinton highlighted Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, echoing Michelle Obama’s comments from the previous night.

“Innovative financing for modern factories …

“are full participates in our economy and our society. Joe Biden wants to build an economy far better suited for our changing world.”

Clinton stressed that Biden will work to make sure the economy works for everyone.

Joe biden,Donald Trump’s statement in full after Joe Biden declared winner,"Democrat Joe Biden has been declared the winner of the United States presidential election by several major national media outlets, defeating incumbent Donald Trump.

Reacting to the projections on Saturday, Trump immediately accused Biden of “rushing to falsely pose as the winner”. The Republican has made repeated claims of electoral fraud without providing evidence, and his campaign has pledged to challenge the result in some battleground states.

Here is Trump’s statement in full:

“We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.

“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their access.

“So what is Biden hiding? I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/7/trump-biden-rushing-to-falsely-pose-as-the-winner,NEGATIVE,0.9929500818252563
Joe biden,Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire takes effect in Lebanon,"A ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollahhas taken effecthours after United States President Joe Biden said a proposal to end the “devastating” conflict had been reached, promising to halt nearly 14 months of cross-border fighting that has killed thousands of people.

The ceasefire began at 4am (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday amid concerns aboutwhether it would holdand lead to the permanent end of fighting between Israel’s military and Hezbollah forces.

Tens of thousands of forcibly displaced civiliansstarted returning hometo the south of the country, defying warnings from the Israeli military not to go back until it withdrew.

“The fighting across the Lebanese-Israeli border will end … This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,” Biden said, announcing the agreement on Tuesday night.

“Civilians on both sides will soon be able to safely return to their communities and begin to rebuild their homes, their schools, their farms, their businesses and their very lives,” he said.

Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called on all displaced Lebanese, including those abroad, to return home.

“Come back to your land. Your land will be stronger with your presence. You should come back. You should protect the land that saw the blood of all the martyrs,” he said in a televised speech on Wednesday.

“Come back to your land and bring back life to all the neighbourhoods that the Israeli occupation and aggression tried to destroy. The victory of your land relies on you coming back,” Berri said.



Hezbollah, which did not participate in any direct talks on the ceasefire – with Berri mediating on the group’s behalf – has yet to formally comment.

As part of the ceasefire agreement, Israel will “gradually withdraw” its forces from southern Lebanon over the next 60 days, and the Lebanese army will deploy to the territory.

On Wednesday, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati called for unity after what he said was the “most cruel phase in Lebanese history”.

He stressed the army’s jurisdiction for security in the south of Lebanon following the ceasefire and said Israel must stay committed to it and withdraw from the south.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the US president that his government had approved the ceasefire and that he appreciated his “understanding that Israel will maintain its freedom of action in enforcing it”, his office said.

Biden released a joint statement with French President Emmanuel Macron, emphasising that both countries “will work with Israel and Lebanon to ensure this arrangement is fully implemented and enforced”.







The US and Francealso committed“to lead and support international efforts for capacity-building of the Lebanese Armed Forces as well as economic development throughout Lebanon to advance stability and prosperity in the region”, according to the statement.

Lebanon began striking Israel on October 8, 2023, in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Cross-border attacks persisted for months. Then, at the start of last month, Israel invaded southern Lebanon.

At least 3,823 people have been killed and 15,859 wounded in Israeli attacks in Lebanon since the war on Gaza began in October last year.

In advance of the ceasefire announcement, Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon continued to rage, with warplanes pounding Beirut’s southern suburbs.

Reporting from the Lebanese capital, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said Israeli attacks continued in the minutes immediately after Biden said the ceasefire was imminent.

“Within five minutes or so of Biden completing his speech, we heard loud explosions in Beirut. Once again, sirens started sounding in northern Israel,” he said.

Earlier in the day, the Israeli military said a barrage of strikes had hit 20 targets in the city in just two minutes.







Seven people were killed and 37 wounded in Israeli attacks on a Beirut building housing displaced people, the National News Agency reported, citing Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health.

“The Israeli strike on the Nweiri area in Beirut destroyed a four-storey building housing displaced people,” Lebanon’s official news agency said.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry said earlier that Israeli strikes had killed at least 31 people on Monday, mostly in the south of the country.

Reporting from the White House, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett noted that the ceasefire announcement comes in the waning days of Biden’s term.

President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20.

The Biden administration has repeatedly sought to broker a ceasefire agreement in Gaza but has come up short. It has repeatedly refused to leverage US military aid to Israel in its push for peace.

In the “coming days” the US “will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power”, Biden posted on social media platform X on Wednesday.







“The fact is, [Tuesday’s ceasefire] falls short of the Biden administration’s goal, in that it does not in any way speak to the conflict in Gaza,” Halkett said.

Still, during the address, Biden pledged to “make another push with Turkiye, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza” in his final days in office.

He also said he would work towards forging new normalisation agreements between Israel and several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, a goal which had been set back amid the war in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/26/biden-announces-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-agreement,NEGATIVE,0.9894118905067444
Joe biden,How Joe Biden suckered Europe,"Europe is lost for answers.

Ever since Russia took Europe by surprise in Ukraine, America has taken its transatlantic partner for granted. With a new type of cold war emerging between Moscow and Washington, the continent has been left in the cold, literally and figuratively.









Dumbstruck and destabilised, the European Union has been divided over how to respond to this new superpower rivalry. Though determined to support Ukraine’s fight for freedom and independence from Russia, Europeans have also been trapped by its consequences.

Some, like Hungary, want some form of accommodation for Russia, while others, like Sweden and Poland, want greater accommodation for America. But the continent’s political and economic power brokers are seeking greater independence from both.

France and Germany, who have long opposed US pressure to expand NATO into Ukraine, are furious at the Biden administration’s manipulative use of the Russia scare to advance America’s interest at the expense of their own.

But America is not letting go and is pushing for a Cold War-style security structure in Europe. As I write these lines, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is leading a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Romania, where some 3,000 US troops are stationed and where, in the 2008 NATO Summit, the US pushed hard for the expansion of the alliance to Ukraine, to the consternation of its major allies.

The Atlanticist British magazine, the Economist,reportsthat “American economic populism and geopolitical rifts threaten the long-run competitiveness of the European Union”, and it warns that, “it is not just the continent’s prosperity that is at risk, the health of the transatlantic alliance is, too”.

Germany, which has grown dependent on Russia for energy and on China for exports and investments, is unhappy with US attempts at severing or limiting Western economic relations with Moscow and Beijing. Chancellor Olaf Sholz’s visit to China earlier this month aimed to restore certainty and stability in German-Chinese relations.

Berlin may have succeeded in filling up its gas storage for this winter, but the energy squeeze and skyrocketing prices are undermining German and other European economies. With gas prices six times higher than their long-term average and Russian gas supplies to Europe significantly diminished, it is not clear how the continent will survive 2023.

Indeed, the energy crunch, combined with a cold winter, could cause more than100,000 extra deathsacross Europe – more than the number of military deaths in Ukraine. But instead of helping its allies tackle the energy crisis, the US is charging Europeans almost four times more for natural gas than in domestic sales.

Meanwhile, Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which is showering US corporate giants with hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, is undercutting their European competitors, while his populist “made-in-America” drive is undermining transatlantic trade.

All of this has provoked the Europeans to accuse America of profiteering from the war and hoovering up their investments, while undermining fair and free trade. In short, they accuse it of replicating China’s policies, which begs the question: with a friend like that, who needs Beijing?

Such is the unfolding transatlantic drama, which prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to call on the EU to “wake up” because “neither the Americans nor the Chinese will cut us any slack”. Other European leaders have demanded that Washington consult and coordinate with its European partners before taking strategic decisions that are vital for their survival or that of the transatlantic alliance.

Alas, these nations are hardly coordinating and consulting among themselves, let alone uniting behind a common strategy worthy of the great challenge they all face from the new global power struggle.

The British exit from the EU, the heated bickering between France and Italy, the persistent tensions between Western and Eastern Europe, and the cooling of relations between France and Germany, are not helping. The 27 EU member states may not all agree to act in unison, but Paris and Berlin must do so if they are to succeed in tackling the crisis.

And yet, President Macron and Chancellor Scholz have thus far failed to work together, as their predecessors did quite successfully during and after the Cold War: from Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Helmut Schmidt, to François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl, Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder, and even Macron and Angela Merkel. This is leaving Europe vulnerable, divided and exposed.

America has not hesitated to bank on European inaction and division. Paradoxically, Biden, who promised to restore confidence to the transatlantic partnership, is creating a transatlantic crisis of confidence.

Indeed, his tight embrace of Europe is posing a greater challenge to European cohesion than George Bush’s belligerence, Barack Obama’s indifference, and Donald Trump’s hostility and resentment. The fact that Biden is acting surprised by Europe’s reaction or playing ignorant of its resentment, adds insult to injury.

For all practical purposes, it feels like Biden is doing to Europe today what former American presidents did at the height of the Cold War, namely keeping Russia out, Germany down, France on the sidelines, and the US, well, right at the centre.

For more than a century, America has repeatedly intervened in Europe, including fighting two world wars and a cold war, to ensure no power or coalition of powers dominates the continent and hence, the world. It is not about to stop now.

In that way, Biden has seized the opportunity presented by Russia’s belligerence in Ukraine to restore America’s dwindling influence in Europe. When it comes to its global dominance, Washington has proven merciless towards foes and friends alike. The British had a taste of it after World War II when the US blackmailed the bankrupt empire economically to gain geopolitical concessions.

But that’s not necessarily the best course of action today. If it is to stand up to both a belligerent Russia and rising China in an increasingly multipolar world, America, indeed the world, is better off with a Europe strong and united, not weak and divided.

Europe may struggle with pervasive racism and mounting fascism, but the EU has proven to be a wiser and more responsible actor than its individual members.",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/11/29/how-joe-biden-suckered-europe,NEGATIVE,0.9860605001449585
Joe biden,"Rafah, US arms, UNRWA: How Biden defends supporting Israel amid Gaza war","Washington, DC –“It’s wrong,” United States PresidentJoe Bidensaid last week of the ongoing Israeli offensive against the southern Gaza city of Rafah, pledging to stop supplying offensive weapons if the assault proceeds.

One week later, however, Israeli forces have seized the Rafah border crossing and pushed into the city, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering. Still, US media reported on Tuesday that Biden plans to advance a $1bn arms transfer to Israel, including tank shells.

Advocates say the apparent contradiction — between pressuring Israel to stop its offensive, then offering further weaponry — is part of a broader pattern whereby the US says one thing but does another.

“We’ve got a situation where the rhetoric is not matching the action,” said Hassan El-Tayyab, legislative director for Middle East policy at the advocacy group Friends Committee on National Legislation. “It’s obviously distressing seeing the US complicity in these horrific war crimes.”

Biden’s statements one week prior signalled to some advocates that Washington may finally use its leverage to pressure Israel to end its abuses against Palestinians.

In a CNN interview, the president said he would stop the transfer of artillery shells to Israel in the case of a Rafah invasion, and his administration ultimately withheld one shipment of heavy bombs over the assault.

But advocates say the media reports of the $1bn transfer raises questions about Biden’s commitment to protecting civilians in Rafah — and standing up to Israel, its longtime ally.







Here, Al Jazeera looks at how the Biden administration presents its policies to overcome legal and political questions about its unconditional support for Israel.

Claim:The US government says Israel has not launched a major invasion of Rafah.

“We believe that what we’re seeing right now is a targeted operation. That’s what Israel has told us. We have not seen a major operation moving forward,” White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday.

Fact:The Israeli offensive in Rafah has so far displaced450,000 Palestiniansfrom the city and further strained the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, raising fears of catastrophic consequences.

While Israeli troops have not entered the dense urban centre of Rafah, Israel’s tanks have been pushing deeperinto the city. Last week, the State Department acknowledged that theoretically “a series of limited operations” can constitute “one large one”.

“It’s not credible to say that the Rafah offensive has not started. From everything we’re seeing, the Rafah invasion is happening. And it should have already crossed that red line,” El-Tayyab told Al Jazeera.







Claim:The Biden administration says it is pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza, often blaming Hamas for rejecting proposals to reach a deal to halt the fighting.

“Israel put a forward-leaning proposal on the table for a ceasefire and hostage deal,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday. “The world should be calling on Hamas to come back to the table and accept a deal.”

Fact:TheUS has vetoedthree separate ceasefire draft resolutions at the United Nations Security Council and voted against two at the General Assembly.

Hamashas accepteda deal put forward by Qatar and Egypt that would lead to a lasting ceasefire and the release of Israeli captives in Gaza and a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel. The Israeli government rejected it.

“What we need is a permanent ceasefire now to end this mass killing, and we need to move towards a resolution of the deeper issues of this horrible conflict,” El-Tayyab said.







Claim:The US says it cannot definitively determine whether Israel is using American weapons to violate international law.

The Biden administration issued a report last week saying that Israel offered “credible and reliable” assurances that US arms are not being deployed to commit abuses.

Fact:Rights groups have documented numerous violations of international humanitarian law by the Israeli military, which extensively uses US weapons. Those reports include evidence ofindiscriminate bombing, torture and targeting civilians.

“There’s a version of reality that this administration would like people to believe in. And then there is a version of reality that people have been actually watching for months now in Gaza, with horrific images of the killing of civilians, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, the starvation of an entire population,” Palestinian American analyst Yousef Munayyer told Al Jazeera.

“And these two realities don’t line up at all. And so, I don’t know what audience this theatre is intended for. But I can’t imagine it being persuasive to anybody really.”







Claim:The Biden administration says it applies the “same standards” to Israel in enforcing theLeahy Law, which prohibits assistance to foreign military units that commit abuses.

Last month, the US State Department said it would not suspend aid to any Israeli battalions despite acknowledging that five units had engaged in gross violations of human rights.

Washington said four of the battalions had taken remedial steps to address the abuses, and the US is engaging with Israel over the fifth unit.

Fact:Experts say the US has a special process in applying the Leahy Law to Israel, giving the country more time and leeway to address allegations of abuse.

“They have made the determination that the unit has been engaged in gross violations and that the host country has failed to remediate,” Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), told Al Jazeera last week.

“And they still have not cut off that unit. That is an admission that the secretary of state is violating US law.”







Claim:The Biden administration says it cut off funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) to “comply with the law”.

The law in question is a governmentfunding billthat Congress passed in March, banning aid to UNRWA.

The UN agency provides vital services to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East and has played a leading role in aid delivery in Gaza.

Fact:Biden supported the funding legislation and signed it into law. Washington had also suspended its assistance to the agency weeks before the bill was approved, following Israeli allegations of links between UNRWA and Hamas.

Last month, anindependent reviewof UNRWA, commissioned by the UN, found that Israel did not provide credible evidence to back its accusations.

“Our political process has chosen to cut US funding to literally the only entity that can address the level of suffering and scale of suffering that’s happening in Gaza right now,” Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute (AAI), told Al Jazeera earlier this year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/15/rafah-us-arms-unrwa-how-biden-defends-supporting-israel-amid-gaza-war,NEGATIVE,0.9946324825286865
Joe biden,US President Biden says ‘chances are real’ for extending Israel-Gaza truce,"United States President Joe Biden has said there is a “real” chance that a four-day pause in Israel’s war on Gaza could be extended.

“I think the chances are real,” he told reporters on Friday, while also refusing to speculate on how long the war that started on October 7 after a surprise Hamas attack inside Israel could last.

“My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can,” Biden said, while reiterating his support for Israel.

He stressed that “eliminating” Hamas remains a “legitimate” mission for Israel.

He only said he has “encouraged” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuto try to limit civilian casualties.

About 15,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed so far in Israeli bombardments following the Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel.

Under the terms of the truce, which came into effect early on Friday, 50 women and children held in Gaza are to be released over four days, in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children who are among thousands imprisoned in Israeli jails.

On Friday, 39 Palestinians were released in the occupied West Bankin exchange for Hamas releasing 24 captives, including 13 Israelis. More are expected to be released on Saturday afternoon.

After the release of the first Hamas-held captives, Biden said: “It’s only a start, but so far it’s gone well.”

Both Israel and Hamas have promised that they will continue to fight, but Israel has signalled it is open to extending the truce if more captives are released at a rate of 10 per day – something Biden said he hoped would come to pass.

Hamas has said the non-civilian Israelis it is holding will only be exchanged for the thousands of Palestinians who arelanguishing in Israeli prisonsin harsh conditions, many of them held without charge.

About 200 trucks with humanitarian aid also made their way into the besieged enclave as part of the truce on Friday, with the first deliveries into northern Gaza since the start of the war arriving on Saturday.

But the level of destruction remains high both in the north and in the south of the Gaza Strip, and the United Nations confirmed on Friday that Israel significantly ramped up its attacks in Gaza before the truce came into effect.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/us-president-biden-says-chances-are-real-for-extending-israel-gaza-truce,POSITIVE,0.9483802318572998
Joe biden,Biden: ‘We will stand with Ukraine’ against Russia on Crimea,"US President Joe Biden has said it’s a “simple truth” that “Crimea is Ukraine” and promised the United States “will never recognise Russia’s purported annexation of the peninsula”.

Russia’s actions on February 26, 2014 violated international law and “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbor Ukraine when it invaded Crimea”, Biden said in a statement on Friday.

Seven years ago, Russia sent troops into Ukraine in violation of the 1995 Black Sea agreement, seized ships from Ukraine’s navy and surrounded and took over military bases.

As the Russian military controlled the peninsula, a political status referendum was held on March 16, 2014 in which an overwhelming majority of voters – 96.7 percent – voted to rejoin Russia, a move Western leaders declared illegal.

Then-President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on a number of senior Russian officials and businessmen connected to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Russian state companies.

The annexation of Crimea instigated the most serious rift between Washington and Moscow since the Cold War.

Mike Pompeo, the former Secretary of State under Donald Trump, said the US would not recognise Russia’s annexation of Ukraine. It is unknown publicly what Trump said in personal meetings with Putin, and it was widely reported that he told G7 leaders in Quebec, Canada in 2018 that Crimea is Russian because everyone speaks Russian there.

Trump blamed Obama for the annexation because Obama failed to prevent it.

Biden said the US would continue to support Ukraine against Russian aggression. Russia supports separatist troops in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/26/biden-we-will-stand-with-ukraine-against-russia-on-crimea,NEGATIVE,0.9517574310302734
Joe biden,Biden pardons thousands convicted of marijuana possession,"US President Joe Biden has announced a sweeping pardon for thousands of people convicted of marijuana possession under federal laws, penalties that havedisproportionatelyaffected Black and other people of colour across the United States.

The announcement on Thursday was seen as a enormous step towards federal decriminalisation of marijuana, a drug that has becomelegal for recreational usein more than a third of US states over the last decade.

Biden said the move reflects his view that “no one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana”.

“There are thousands of people who have prior federal convictions for marijuana possession, who may be denied employment, housing, or educational opportunities as a result,” he said in a statement.

“My action will help relieve the collateral consequences arising from these convictions.”

The order only applies to those convicted on federal charges of “simple marijuana possession” – a term that refers to drug possession for personal use, with no intent to distribute – and does not relate to those who have been convicted of possessing marijuana in state courts.

As I’ve said before, no one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana.

Today, I’m taking steps to end our failed approach. Allow me to lay them out.

— President Biden (@POTUS)October 6, 2022



In the statement, Biden urged US governors to take similar action to pardon state-level offences.

“Just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either,” he said.

Biden did not say exactly how many people would receive pardons, but a senior US official told reporters that Thursday’s measure would affect about 6,500 people.

Criminal justice reform groups applauded the order, with JustLeadershipUSA President DeAnna Hoskins calling it “life-changing for thousands of Americans living with a federal marijuana conviction”.

That includes “both those who are currently incarcerated and those who have already served their sentences but have continued to carry the stigma and experience the collateral consequences of those convictions”, Hoskins said in a statement.

Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, also called Biden’s decision an “important step toward righting the wrongs of the failed, racist War on Drugs”, referring to the federal campaign to criminalise drug use that began in the 1970s.

Thursday’s move follows a years-longeffortby Democrats in the US House of Representatives and more recently in the Senate to legalise marijuana at the federal level.

States across the country also have rapidly moved in recent years to both decriminalise or outright legalise marijuana for recreational use.

Since Colorado legalised marijuana in 2012, another 19 states have followed suit, as well as the US territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, and the federal district of Washington, DC.

Legal marijuana dispensaries and cultivation services, meanwhile, have becomebig business.

Biden’s order does not change federal law, which has since 1970 classified marijuana as a “schedule one” controlled substance, on par with heroin and LSD.

Biden noted that the marijuana classification is higher than that of “fentanyl and methamphetamine – the drugs that are driving ouroverdose epidemic“.

The US president said he had asked the secretary of health and human services, Xavier Becerra, and Attorney General Merrick Garland to review marijuana’s current classification.

He added that “important limitations on trafficking, marketing, and under-age sales” of marijuana should stay in place as the country rolls back restrictions.

Black people are arrested for marijuana possession at nearly 4x the rate of white people.

Expunging the records of those with possession convictions is a matter of social justice. Thank you,@potus!https://t.co/SAf0lM7Bcr

Joe biden,I was punished under the Espionage Act. Why wasn’t Joe Biden?,"In February, I was released from federal prison, having served 33 months for a violation of the Espionage Act, after Idisclosed classified informationdetailing what I saw as the high moral cost of America’s drone assassination program. Before having time to adjust to the world beyond concrete walls, I was struck by the news of Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report [PDF] wherein he lays out the reasons he decided not to charge President Joe Biden for alleged violations of the same law.

I am always encouraged to hear whenever the Justice Department decides against using the Espionage Act. By the time the ink of the 1917 law had dried, it was already being used to silence voices of dissent across the country. Thousands were rounded up and summarily convicted for their opposition to America’s involvement in the bloodiest conflict in human history at the time.









While some of the worst aspects of the law have since been amended, the Espionage Act remains the premier criminal statute for prosecuting government sources who rely upon the press to expose secret government abuses to the public. The decision by Justice Department officials to go after government whistleblowers with the Espionage Act has been a part of a concerted effort to signal clearly that the next person who dares speak with a reporter could find themselves facing decades of incarceration.

After reading Special Counsel Hur’s report, I was curious to find the similarities between my case and that of the investigation into the president. According to the report, President Biden kept classified information outside of a secure facility at his home and office – as did I. The president later spoke with a reporter about the classified information he retained – again, as did I.

Both President Biden and I expressed to our respective reporters the concerns we had about official US policy – his about the failed 2009 surge in Afghanistan (as vice president) and mine about the consequences of that policy. So why the decision to prosecute one and not the other?

According to Hur, the president would have been seen as too sympathetic to convince a jury of fault in this case. That Hur believes Biden is a well-meaning individual who did not intend any harm by his actions is a good reason for not charging him. Now contrast that with what the government said about me at my sentencing, accusing me of endangering the public and likening me to a heroin dealer. I was portrayed not as someone with good intentions, but as someone who tried to “ingratiate himself with reporters” for the sake of notoriety, as opposed to acting in the public interest.

Hur goes on to cleverly dodge the matter of intent where the Espionage Act is concerned. Counterintuitively, the law does not require proof of intent to harm the United States – only evidence that the unauthorised possessor of national defence information knowingly retains it and wilfully communicates it to someone not entitled to receive it.

Prosecutors usually prove this by pointing to the stacks of nondisclosure agreements every clearance holder must sign in order to remain employed. Being elected, Biden might never have had to sign such an agreement, but – his degree of sympathy aside – it would not have taken much to prove that he knew the disclosure of classified information to be unlawful.

Nevertheless, Biden is let off the hook because he did not mean any harm. In contrast, the government’s pre-trial motions in my case argued that I not be allowed to present evidence of what it called my “good motives”. Afraid my motives might make me appear too sympathetic to a jury, I – like every other whistleblower before me – was rendered effectively defenceless because of a legal technicality in the way the law is written. Given no other choice, I was forced to plead out to avert a costly, unwinnable trial.

All told, the guilt I professed for wilfully delivering national defence information to a journalist was nothing compared to the immense shame I felt for wilfully participating in the drone programme. In 2021, scarcely weeks after I was sentenced to federal prison, Zemari Ahmadi and nine members of his family, most of them small children, were the victims of a mistaken US drone strike. The Pentagon called it a “righteous strike” before the truth forced them to quietly back away and conduct an internal investigation in which it found no one to be at fault for the innocent lives that were taken.

To this day, I am the only person to have worked in the drone programme to have been held responsible. Not for my role in it, but for my effort to reveal the deadly truth of it to the public with the help of a journalist.

I am sincerely glad President Biden was able to receive what so many others in the crosshairs of the Espionage Act have been denied – the benefit of the doubt. But if Joe Biden truly wishes to convey the kind of ideals that helped secure his presidency in the first place, he would utilise his power as president to pardon the whistleblowers and cease the global war on terror policy of “targeted” killing.

Joe biden,Biden threatens sanctions after Myanmar military coup,"US President Joe Biden on Monday threatened to reimpose sanctions on Myanmar following a coup by the country’s military leaders and called for a concerted international response to push them into relinquishing power.

Biden condemned the military’s takeover from the civilian-led government on Monday and its detention of the country’s elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi as “a direct assault on the country’s transition to democracy and the rule of law”.

The crisis in Myanmar marks the first chief test of Biden’s pledge to collaborate more with allies on international challenges, especially on China’s rising influence, in contrast to predecessor Donald Trump’s “America First” approach.

The coup also brought rare policy alignment between Biden’s Democrats and top Republicans as they denounced the military takeover and called for consequences.

“The international community should come together in one voice to press the Burmese military to immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained,” Biden said in a statement.

“The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,” he said.

Biden warned the US was “taking note of those who stand with the people of Burma in this difficult hour.”

“We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burma’s democratic transition,” he said.







A US official later told the Reuters news agency the administration had launched high-level internal discussions aimed at crafting a “whole of government” response and planned to consult closely with Congress.



Greg Poling and Simon Hudes at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies said there would almost certainly be new sanctions against those involved in the coup.

“But that is unlikely to have much immediate impact on the generals,” they said, given that few of them had any intention of travelling to or doing business in the US.

Also, unlike its reaction to a 2014 coup in Thailand, the US cannot pull back on military exercises, training, and sales, because military-to-military relations with Myanmar are almost non-existent, they said.

Former President Barack Obama started easing sanctions on Myanmar in 2011 after the military began loosening its grip, and in 2016 lifted many remaining restrictions. In 2019, the Trump administration imposed targeted sanctions on four military commanders, including coup leader General Min Aung Hlaing, over allegations of abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities.

Human rights groups said the international community needed to recognise the shortcomings of their engagement during Myanmar’s democratic transition and take tougher steps to rein in the military.

“The Tatmadaw has exposed the vast vulnerabilities of Myanmar’s democratic institutions by staging this brazen coup,” Akila Radhakrishnan, the president of the Global Justice Center.

“Given the history of military rule, the risk of ensuing violence and atrocities is greater than any moment in recent memory. We can’t ignore the repeated failure of the international community to take concerted action to curb military power and hold it accountable for its constant human rights abuses, including its genocidal campaign against the Rohingya.”

As the country’s leader, Aung San Suu Kyidefendedher nation at the International Court of Justice in The Hague on 2019 against charges of genocide in the treatment of the mostly Muslim Rohingya after at least 740,000 fled the western state of Rakhine in the wake of a brutal military crackdown in 2017.

Monitors say the armed forces continue to commitabuses in Rakhineand in other ethnic minority areas of the country.

The Network for Human Rights Documentation – Burma (ND-Burma) said an emergency meeting at the United Nations Security Council had to be convened, with a delegation to be sent to Myanmar.

“Members must address the current situation in Myanmar with greater force and effectiveness than they have in the past,” ND-Burma said in a statement.



The 15-member Security Council plans to discuss Myanmar in a closed meeting on Tuesday, according to diplomats.

“We want to address the long-term threats to peace and security, of course working closely with Myanmar’s Asia and ASEAN neighbours,” Britain’s UN Ambassador Barbara Woodward, president of the council for February, told reporters.

Wai Wai Nu, Founder and Director of the Women’s Peace Network and a Rohingya activist, said on Tuesday civil society wanted a “bolder” international response to the coup including the referral to the ICC, immediate sanctions on the military and its businesses, and a global arms embargo on the country.

Key to any action will be the response of China and Russia, which as permanent members have a veto in the council. In 2017, their support protected Myanmar from any significant move in response to the Rohingya crackdown.

“It’s our hope that any move of the Council would be conducive to the stability of Myanmar rather than making the situation more complicated,” a spokesperson for China’s UN mission said.

Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won a landslide victory in the country’s November 8 election but the army, which is guaranteed a quarter of the seats in parliament and also has a proxy party cried foul.







It claimed on Monday that its takeover was a response to election fraud, although there has been no evidence of wrong-doing, and that its actions were justified under the 2008 constitution that was written by the armed forces.

“For years, world leaders praised a ‘democratic’ transition and constitution that gave the military the very power they used to stage today’s coup,” Global Justice Center’s Radhakrishnan added. “Now, we’re seeing the consequences of an international order that blinds itself to reality in the interest of ‘progress’ and economic investment instead of protecting human rights.”

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a regular news briefing Washington had had “intensive” conversations with allies. She declined to say what other actions were under consideration aside from sanctions.

Psaki said Biden’s remark that the US was “taking note” of how other countries respond was “a message to all countries in the region.”

The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez, said Washington and other countries “should impose strict economic sanctions, as well as other measures” against Myanmar’s army and the military leadership if they did not free the country’s elected leaders and remove themselves from government.

He also charged that the Myanmar army was guilty of “genocide” against minority Rohingya Muslims – a determination yet to be stated by the US government – and of a sustained campaign of violence against other minorities.

US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who like members of the Biden administration has had close past ties with Suu Kyi, called the arrests “horrifying” and said Washington needed to “impose costs” on those behind the coup.

“The Biden Administration must take a strong stand and our partners and all democracies around the world should follow suit in condemning this authoritarian assault on democracy,” he said.

The events in Myanmar are a significant challenge for the Biden administration and its effort to forge a robust Asia Pacific policy to stand up to China.

Many of Biden’s Asia policy team, including its head, Kurt Campbell, are veterans of the Obama administration, which on leaving office in 2016 hailed its work to end decades of military rule in Myanmar as a major foreign policy achievement.

Joe biden,What will Biden’s policies on Israel look like?,"As President-elect Joe Biden announces the final choices for his cabinet, many in the American political establishment are breathing a sigh of relief. Predictability, moderation and centrism in policymaking are the words of the day.

Though progressive Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loomed large in efforts to bring Democrats out to vote in record numbers, Biden seems to have turned his back on them and their progressive agenda as he fills federal agencies and cabinet positions.









That holds true in foreign policy as well. Many pundits are expecting continuity with the Democratic administrations of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. This middle of the road approach was recently confirmed by Biden’s pick for secretary of state – Antony Blinken – who has an impeccable Democratic pedigree. Blinken’s father and uncle served as ambassadors under Clinton and his step-father served in the Kennedy administration.

Blinken has been described as a “multilateralist” and “internationalist” who believes in close ties with European allies. He is also known to firmly stand by Israel and support the Iran nuclear deal. So what does this mean for Washington’s closest ally in the Middle East – Israel?

“Status quo” in Palestine

Given the dysfunctional federal government Biden will inherit from outgoing President Donald Trump, including a massive COVID-related economic and public health crisis, his administration will have to concentrate on resolving domestic issues.

US foreign policy will most likely focus on countering China’s expansionism, Russia’s interference in European, and American affairs and Iran’s antagonism provoked by the Trump administration. These issues pose a major challenge to US policymakers and will absorb much of the energy of the Biden foreign policy team.

​This means the Biden administration is unlikely to put forward any major initiatives to resolve the conflict in Israel-Palestine. It may reverse some of the pernicious policies of the Trump administration, reopening the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office in Washington and the US consulate in East Jerusalem, which serves Palestinians, and resuming funding for UNWRA.

However, Biden will not move the US embassy to Israel back to Tel Aviv, as he made clear ahead of the elections. Blinken, his secretary of state pick, has also said such a move “would not make sense practically and politically”.​

Blinken has also made a number of controversial statements regarding the Palestinians, accusing them of being responsible for the failure of negotiations. “In the category of ‘Never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity’, I think a reminder to Palestinians … that they can and should do better and deserve better and that requires leadership: leadership to make clear the reality of the Jewish state; leadership to make clear the need to end incitement and violence; leadership to bring people along for the prospect of negotiating,” he said in May, using the words of former Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban.

The Biden campaign has also made its stance on the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement quite clear. Ahead of the election, it released a statement saying it “firmly reject[s] the BDS movement, which singles out Israel – home to millions of Jews – and too often veers into antisemitism, while letting Palestinians off the hook for their choices” – although the latter part referring to the Palestinians was later removed after it provoked controversy in the Arab-American community.

Biden is likely to revert to the historic US position on Israeli settlements – that they are illegal and an obstacle to peace – but he and Blinken are unlikely to do anything about it. They will likely favour the “status quo” in Palestine, which means the Israeli government will continue undisturbed to move farther towards its goal of absorbing the Occupied Palestinian Territories into Israel proper, leaving Palestinians stateless aliens in their own land.

No cheerleader for Netanyahu

Unlike Sanders, who has advocated for tying US military assistance to restraining Israeli settlements, Biden fully supports unconditional aid for Israel. Both he and Blinken have declared to Israel lobby audiences that withholding aid would be a hostile act against Israel and rejected it outright.

That said, Biden is unlikely to serve as a cheerleader for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or the Israeli radical right, as Trump did. There will be no Israeli election campaign banners featuring Netanyahu and Biden, hanging on skyscrapers.

Although relations with the Israeli prime minister may not be as icy as they were under Obama – who personally disliked him – Biden is unlikely to go out of his way to maintain Likud in power. He will not produce electoral gifts for Netanyahu, by backing Israeli annexation of the West Bank or recognising Israeli sovereignty over illegal Israeli settlements, as Trump did.

Thus, if Israel goes to the polls – as many observers expect – for the fourth time in two years, Netanyahu may not be re-elected. He will likely face court on the three corruption counts he is charged with and may get sentenced to prison.

But even if he loses power, this is unlikely to moderate Israel’s current policies. Given the lack of real ideological diversity in the choices for prime minister, Biden would eschew any intervention on behalf of any candidate.

His administration will probably support the process of Arab normalisation started under Trump and championed by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. But given that Kushner spearheaded this effort with the close cooperation of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, normalisation may decelerate under Biden, as US relations with these states may become quite tenuous. One of the main reasons for that will be Biden’s declared aim of returning to the nuclear agreement with Iran.

The Iran deal challenge

Policy on Iran will be one area in which the incoming Biden administration will clash not only with Gulf allies but also with Israel. Netanyahu campaigned tirelessly against the nuclear agreement before it was signed. After Trump took office, the Israeli prime minister urged Trump to reject it, which he did.

Biden has repeatedly said he wants the US to return to the original Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He is seeking a return to a more stable, less contentious relationship with Iran – one which guarantees it will not develop nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future in return for lifting punitive economic sanctions.

Israel – with the help of Trump – is trying to prevent this from happening. The recent assassinations of a senior al-Qaeda figure in Tehran and the country’s leading nuclear scientist, Moshen Fakrizadeh, are designed to box Biden in and undermine his efforts to reach out to Iran. Israel hopes this killing, as well as the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani by a US drone in January, will convince Iranian hardliners to reject a return to nuclear negotiations. Given Blinken and Biden’s exceedingly close relations with the Israel lobby, they will be torn between pursuing their own policy agenda and mollifying Israel’s hawkish demands.

They will also have to restrain Israel’s military adventurism, including its oft-stated goal of regime change and attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. Obama restrained Netanyahu from such attacks, but the Israeli leader has shown nothing but disdain for Democratic presidents and their warnings.

​Can Joe Biden say no to Israel? And if he does, will Israeli leaders accept such a rejection? Or will they continue their reckless policy of assassination, sabotage, and perhaps even an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities? All of these challenges will show what Joe Biden is really made of.

Joe biden,"Biden attacks Trump as threat to democracy, warns against his re-election","US President Joe Biden has warned voters against re-electing Donald Trump in this year’s election, saying the likely Republican presidential nominee presents a serious risk to the country and described him as a threat to democracy.

The speech on Friday came one day before thethird anniversary of the January 6attack when a violent group of Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol in a desperate bid to keep him in power after his 2020 election loss.

“He told the crowd to fight like hell. And all hell was unleashed,” Biden said at a community college in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. “Then as usual he left the dirty work to others. He retreated to the White House.”

Biden characterised Trump and his followers as dangerous outliers and asked Democrats, independents and “mainstream Republicans” who cherish US democracy to back him.

“Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot,” he said.

“Donald Trump’s campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future,” Biden said. “Trump’s assault on democracy isn’t just part of his past. It’s what he’s promising for the future.”

Before his speech, Biden toured the Valley Forge site of George Washington’s Revolutionary War-era winter headquarters in late 1777 and early 1778.

He contrasted Trump’s bid to hang on to power to the example set by Washington, who stepped down willingly after two terms as the first US president.

Biden said Trump’s re-election bid was based on trying to seek “revenge and retribution” against his political enemies. He reminded Americans that Trump has called his opponents “vermin,” the “same exact language used in Nazi Germany”.

“How dare he? Who in God’s name does he think he is?” said Biden.

Trump, president from 2017 to 2021, is leading the field for the Republican nomination for president. He contested his defeat in the 2020 election, prompting thousands of his supporters to attack the US Capitol.

The failed bid to stop formal certification of the result caused the deaths of five people and injured dozens of police officers.

Biden also criticised Republicans for changing their tone on Trump, saying that when the attacks of January 6 took place, “there was no doubt about the truth” and that some Republican members of Congress and Fox News commentators had publicly and privately condemned the uprising.

“But now as time has gone on – politics, fear, money – have all intervened. And those MAGA voices who know the truth about Trump and January 6th have abandoned the truth and abandoned our democracy,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign.

More than 1,230 people have been charged with federal crimes for their participation, including felonies such as assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.

Trump hit back during a speech on Friday in Sioux Center, Iowa, and called Biden’s record “an unbroken streak of weakness, incompetence, corruption and failure”.

Ahead of Biden’s speech, the Trump campaign released an advertisement accusing him of being “the true destroyer of democracy” citing special counselJack Smith’sinvestigation into Trump’s actions on January 6.

Smith, a veteran prosecutor known for pursuing mob bosses, has charged Trump with conspiring to illegally subvert the results of the 2020 election. The former president faces four criminal counts as part of the indictment.

Trump, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges and denied any wrongdoing, has accused prosecutors of conducting a politically motivated “witch hunt” to derail his 2024 re-election bid.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/6/biden-attacks-trump-as-threat-to-democracy-warns-against-his-re-election,NEGATIVE,0.9887922406196594
Joe biden,Biden says he would not back Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites,"United States President Joe Biden has voiced opposition to any strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites in response toTehran’s missile attackon Israel.

When asked by reporters on Wednesday whether he would back such retaliation, Biden stated “the answer is no”.

Biden’s comments come a day after Iran fired some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, its second attack on the countrysince April.Iran’s most recent attacks on Israeli military sites have come in response to the assassination of key Iran-allied figures, includingHamas leader Ismail Haniyehand Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.







Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Iran would “pay” for the strike, which reportedly did not cause any serious casualties in Israel but killed one Palestinian in the occupied West Bank.

Analysts warned Israel may seize the chance to launch attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities, a target its leaders have long eyed.

“The risk of an [Israeli] attack on the nuclear programme is particularly high because Iran’s defensive shield Hezbollah is on its knees,” Ali Vaez, the Iran Project director at the International Crisis Group think tank, told Al Jazeera.

“US forces are already in the region shielding Israel, and for Israel, this is potentially a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take care of a major threat that it has perceived from Iran over the past few decades,” he said.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett explicitly called for such an attack in a post on X, saying Israel must “act now to destroy Iran’s nuclear program”.

“We have the justification. We have the tools”, Bennett said.

In the wake of Iran’s attack, Biden emphasised that the US is “fully supportive of Israel”.

Other US officials warned Iran would face “severe consequences”, with State Department spokesman Matthew Miller telling reporters he was not “ruling anything out”.

On Wednesday, after Biden spoke with allied leaders, he said he would not support an attack on Iran’s nuclear facility. Any Israeli response to Iran, he told reporters, should be “proportional”, a position shared by all nations part of the G7 grouping, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

The White House also said Biden and G7 leaders spoke about coordinating a new round of sanctions against Iran.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said that the attack was warranted, but that Tehran did not seek war with Israel.

Iran’s armed forces warned that Israel would face “vast destruction” if it retaliated.







The escalation between two of the Middle East’s strongest militaries – while war continues to rage in Gaza and Lebanon – has stoked fears of an even broader conflict in the region.

“The idea of Iran and Israel going after each other under the auspices of the United States will burn everyone in the Middle East and beyond,” said Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara.

Joe biden,"Biden battles Trump, lack of enthusiasm among Black voters","Racial inequality in the United States came intosharp focusthis year, and became a defining topic of thenational debate, after police killings of Black Americans ignited months of widespread protests and galvanised the nation to demand racial justice and police reforms.

The unrest has forcedUS President Donald Trump, a Republican who is running for re-election on a “law and order” platform, and his main challenger, Democratic nomineeJoe Biden, to wrestle with the complicated issue of race in America, and try to appeal to Black voters.









But with less than two months before the election, in the middle of a pandemic and record-high unemployment rates, whether Black Americans will be energised to come out in large numbers to vote remains uncertain – potentially defining the outcome of the 2020 election.

Arecent pollshows Biden by far outperforming Trump among Black voters, with 78 percent support.

“Most Black voters are going to support Joe Biden,” said Ravi Perry, professor and chair of the Department of Political Science at Howard University, a historically Black university.

“But there are differences in enthusiasm,” Perry tells Al Jazeera, “where Black women, for instance, have far more enthusiasm towards Biden, and many young people, support him but with far less enthusiasm.”

Earlier this month, both candidates visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, a battleground state, and the site of the most recent turmoil following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who remains hospitalised after being shot in the back seven times by a white police officer while authorities were trying to arrest him in late August.

Speaking at a local church in Kenosha after aprivate meetingwith Blake and his family, Bidensaidthe latest events would help Americans confront centuries of systemic racism.

In contrast,Trumpdid not mention Blake by name, refused to acknowledge systemic racism and instead blasted the protesters and offered his unequivocalsupportto law enforcement.

Data shows that Black voters have overwhelmingly supported the Democratic Party since at least the 1960s, when the party passed civil rights legislation that outlawed racial segregation and prohibited racial discrimination in voting.

But Black turnout, which rose in the 2008 and 2012 elections when the US elected and then re-elected the nation’s first Black president,Barack Obama, waned in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee.

More profoundly, there is a growing level of cynicism among Black voters, pollsters have argued, particularly among young and male voters, and point to 2016 – when Clinton lost to Trump amid a six percentage points decline among Black voters – which proved critical in battleground states.

Trump’s campaign this year has been trying to appeal to Black voters, particularly Black male voters and improve on his 2016 results, when 8 percent of Black people voted for him.

According to arecent poll, 13 percent of Black voters said they plan to vote for Trump this election.

Democratic pollster Terrance Woodbury said, according to recent data he compiled, about half of Black voters believe the Democratic Party takes Black voters for granted and may choose to stay home or vote for Trump.

“What we saw at the Republican National Convention was a very overt attempt to speak directly to the issues that are most important to Black men: criminal justice reform and unemployment,” Woodbury said.

On the first night of the convention in August, the only Black Republican US senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, relayed his personal success story, “Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,” he said. And Trump gave a full pardon to Jon Ponder, a Black convicted felon turned criminal justice activist.

Several other Black speakers took the stage during the four-day event, including NFL players and a civil rights activist, and some touted Biden’sgaffewhen he said that “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.”

“The course of this election year will show that Black men are not a marginal part of his (Trump’s) strategy, but a path to victory,” Woodbury told Al Jazeera, “and he’s leaning into it.”

And yet for many, voting Trump out of office, is a motivation on its own.

Trump promoted the “birther movement”, alleging that Obama was not born in the US. He refused to condemn white supremacists and more recently, he allegedly called Black people “too stupid” to vote for him, according to his estranged former lawyerMichael Cohen.

James Lance Taylor, a professor at the University of San Francisco, said many Black people will vote for Biden for no other reason than “to deal with the emergency of removing Donald Trump from office”.

Many of the demonstrators who took to the streets after the police killing ofGeorge Floydin May were making calls to “defund the police,” which would divert funds away from police departments and prisons in favour of investments in social services and re-examine what offences require a militarised response.

Biden has said, “I don’t support defunding the police.” Instead, he has proposed a$300m investmentin policing, contingent on officers mirroring the diversity of their communities.

According to a Gallup survey taken in July, 70 percent of Black Americans support or strongly support reducing police department budgets. But despite its popularity among Black Americans, strategists said if Biden backed the idea, he would run the risk of losing the support of moderate older white voters, a key demographic.

“Defund the police may sound pretty good on Twitter, but to an awful lot of voters, including African Americans, it doesn’t make much sense,” Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist told Al Jazeera.

“They want better policing, they want smarter policing, they don’t want the police defunded,” Manley said.

Instead of embracing “defund the police,” Biden, who served as Obama’s Vice President for eight years, nodded to Black voters by choosing SenatorKamala Harrisas his running mate, making her the first Black woman to be nominated on a major party’s ticket.

“Black folks noticed and were excited by it,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund.

“There is a segment of our community that thinks Kamala Harris’ record as district attorney and attorney general is shaky,” he said in reference to her years as a prosecutor when she embraced a “top cop” label. “But the overall feeling is definitely that is a step in the right direction, a sense that he recognises us.”

The coronavirus pandemic, a disease which has killed more than 192,000 Americans and disproportionately affectedBlack communities, has added an additional layer of uncertainty regarding how many and who will be able to cast their vote in November.

Most states said they will expand theirmail-in votingsystems amid health concerns about crowds and long lines. It remains unclear how turnout will be affected.

But for most, Albright says, the desire to see Trump out of office, casts an urgency on the importance of voting this year that will outweigh all other considerations.

“Even among people who are not enthusiastic about Biden, people are more clear, now we know better,” he said, “We see what a Trump presidency looks like and how it is impacting our lives and our health.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/12/biden-battles-trump-lack-of-enthusiasm-among-black-voters,POSITIVE,0.9661601185798645

Joe biden,Biden joins fellow US Democrats in call for easing Iran sanctions,"Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden on Thursday called on the administration of United States President Donald Trump to ease economic sanctions on Iran as a humanitarian gesture during the global coronavirus pandemic.

The former vice president said the US has a moral obligation to be among the first to offer aid to people in need regardless of where they live when confronting a virus that knows no borders or political affiliations.

“While the Iranian government has failed to respond effectively to this crisis, including lying and concealing the truth from its own people, and it continues to act provocatively in the region, the Iranian people are hurting desperately,” Biden said in astatement. “Whatever our profound differences with the Iranian government, we should support the Iranian people.”

Biden’s statement comes just days after 34 members of the US Congress – most from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party – signed aletterto Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling for easing the sanctions. Among the signatories was Biden’s fellow Democratic presidential contender, Senator Bernie Sanders.

“With neighboring countries ravaged by war, medical systems either in disarray and underfunded, and the constant migration of pilgrims and immigrant workers, the virus’s further spread in the Middle East poses serious risk both to human health and life and to regional economic and political stability,” the letter stated.

Trump ramped up his attacks on Iran on Wednesday by claiming that it or its proxies were planning a sneak attack on US targets in neighbouring Iraq. He tweeted that Tehran would pay a “very heavy price” for any such action, but offered no details.

The Trump administration has repeatedly tightened sanctions designed to choke off Tehran’s oil exports in the last month as the coronavirus outbreak has spread in Iran. Last week, it slapped new sanctions on 20 Iranian people and companies accused of supporting Shia militia in Iraq that are believed to be responsible for attacks on bases where US forces are located.

Biden acknowledged that there are already humanitarian exceptions to the sanctions in place, but said many countries and international aid organisations remain leery of offering help for fear of running afoul of the US sanctions. He said that in response, Iran should as a gesture release any American citizens it currently has detained in the country.

“Artificially limiting the flow of international humanitarian assistance to pursue a political point will not only allow the Iranian government to deflect responsibility for its own botched response, it will increase the threat this virus poses to the American people, now and in the future,” Biden said.

Specific steps that should be taken, Biden said, include issuing broad licences to pharmaceutical and medical device companies, creating a mechanism for banks, insurers and other firms to help Iranians in need, and issuing new sanctions guidance to aid organisations to reassure them that they will not be punished for engaging in humanitarian trade with Iran to support its coronavirus response.

Iran’s Ministry of Health and Medical Education said on Thursday that the coronavirus has killed 3,160 in the country.

Several high-ranking government officials have tested positive for the virus, including the speaker of the Iranian parliament. Health officials there announced on Thursday that Ali Larijani, a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander who has led the country’s legislative body since 2008, tested positive for the virus and was being treated under quarantine.



In a rare acknowledgment of the severity of the outbreak in his country, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the coronavirus may remain through the end of the Iranian year, which just began late last month, state TV reported on Thursday.

“We always have to follow the health protocols provided by the health ministry,” Rouhani added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/6/biden-joins-fellow-us-democrats-in-call-for-easing-iran-sanctions,NEGATIVE,0.9675692915916443
Joe biden,US Election 2024,"After weeks of mounting pressure, United States PresidentJoe Biden on Sunday dropped outof the November presidential election.

Biden’swithdrawal from the raceopens up questions about who might replace him on the Democrat ticket less than four months before the vote. Biden himself endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the party’s nomination, but the Democratic National Convention, scheduled for August, is where Biden’s successor as standard bearer might well be decided.

The pressure on the president to pull out started building up from within his party following a disastrous performance in thepresidential debateon June 27, when he mumbled his answers and appeared to lose his train of thought at times. In recent days, a flood of Democratic leaders, including members of Congress and influential supporters of the party, have called on him to step aside from the race. On Thursday, it was announced thathe was suffering from COVID-19.

Yet, Biden had the delegates needed to secure his nomination at the party’s August convention.

So, just how rare is this moment in US history? We press rewind to look at previous incumbents who have dropped out – or been forced out – of presidential elections they had hoped to win.

Before Biden, no incumbent eligible for another term had opted out of the election in nearly half a century.

Back in 1968, Democrat Lyndon B Johnson was the sitting president. He had served as the vice president to President John F Kennedy following the 1960 election and then had taken charge as president after Kennedy’s assassination in November 1963. Johnson then won the 1964 election.

At the start of 1968, Johnson was the frontrunner for his party’s nomination, but only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary against anti-Vietnam Warchallenger Senator Eugene McCarthy.

His approval ratings were in free fall, as popular sentiment against the Vietnam War grew. By March 10, his approval rating hadfallen to 36 percent, the lowest it had been in his presidency.

Then, on March 31, about seven months before the election, Johnson announced on national television that he would not be seeking re-election. He was 60 at the time.

Johnson’s VP Hubert Humphrey eventually replaced him on the ticket and Republican challenger Richard Nixon won the election.

Like Johnson would some years later, Truman came to the top job via the vice presidency. He was VP to Franklin Roosevelt until the latter’s death in early 1945, when Truman took charge. He served the remainder of that term, won the election in 1948, and was eligible to run for his second full term in the 1952 election.

Indeed, Truman started the primary season as the incumbent seeking re-election. But by February 9, 1952, his approval rating hadcratered to 22 percent, an all-time low.

On March 29, 1952, Truman announced that he would not be running again. Initially reluctant, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson ran in place of Truman and lost to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.

Arthur was the running mate of Republican James Garfield, who won the presidency in 1880. Garfield was assassinated in 1881 and Arthur assumed office in his place. While he was president,Arthur contracted a kidney disease, which remained unknown to the public.

He lost the support of his strongest allies by going against the patronage system, signing a law that banned kickbacks in the civil services and made merit the criteria for determining salaries and promotions.

During the Republican nomination convention in June 1884, when he was seeking re-election, Arthur lost his nomination to James Blaine.

In the November 4 election, Democrat Grover Cleveland defeated Blaine.

Democrat Johnson was the running mate of Abraham Lincoln on the National Union Party ticket in 1865.

The same year, Lincoln was assassinated and Johnson took his place.

He was impeached in May 1868 and convicted by a Republican Congress. He was convicted of violating the Tenure of Office Act after he removed Republican Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.

Johnson failed to be nominated by the Democrats, who nominated Horatio Seymour. In the election, Republican Ulysses Grant defeated Seymour.

Sitting Democratic President Pierce was the first full-term president of the US to not be nominated by his party for a second term. This decision came on June 2, 1856, five months before the November 4 election.

Pierce had bled support among northern Democrats since the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed the two new states to decide on the legality ofslaveryin their territories. This upset anti-slavery northern Democrats.

At the Democratic National Convention, those tensions came to a head. The party dumped Pierce’s candidature and instead chose James Buchanan as their nominee. Buchanan won the election.

Fillmore was the vice president of conservative Whig Party President Zachary Taylor, who died in 1850, a little more than a year after assuming office.

The Whig Party convention in June 1852 did not choose Fillmore and instead went with Winfield Scott to run in the November 2 election. This followed a split between the supporters of Fillmore and Secretary of State Daniel Webster.

Scott lost the election to Democrat Franklin Pierce.

Tyler was the running mate of Whig President William Henry Harrison, who took office after winning the 1840 election.

Harrison died of an acute illness in 1841. Following this, Tyler was sworn in as president – the first time a VP was taking over as president mid-term after the death of an incumbent.

During his presidency, Tyler lost support within his party and was expelled by the Whigs in 1842. In 1844, he nonetheless sought re-election after his drive for the annexation of Texas – which would have expanded the territorial ambit of slavery while risking war with Mexico – divided the nation.

However, the Democratic Party picked James Polk. The Whig party, meanwhile, denied Tyler its nomination at the party’s national convention, picking Henry Clay instead. On August 20, 1844, Tyler dropped out of the race.

Joe biden,"Biden slaps new tariffs on Chinese imports, ratcheting trade war","President Joe Biden has slapped major new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment, taking potshots at Donald Trump along the way as he embraced a strategy that’s increasing friction between the world’s two largest economies.

The Democratic president said on Tuesday that Chinese government subsidies ensure the nation’s companies do not have to turn a profit, giving them an unfair advantage in global trade.

“American workers can outwork and outcompete anyone as long as the competition is fair,” Biden said in the White House Rose Garden. “But for too long, it hasn’t been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies … it’s not competition, it’s cheating.”

China immediately promised retaliation. Its Ministry of Commerce said Beijing was opposed to the tariff hikes by the United States and would take measures to defend its interests.

Biden will keep tariffs put in place by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump while ratcheting up others, including a quadrupling of EV duties to more than 100 percent and doubling the duties on semiconductor tariffs to 50 percent.

The new measures affect $18bn in imported Chinese goods including steel and aluminium, semiconductors, electric vehicles, critical minerals, solar cells and cranes, the White House said. The EV figure, while headline-grabbing, may have more political than practical impact in the US, which imports very few Chinese EVs.

The US imported $427bn in goods from China in 2023 and exported $148bn to the world’s number-two economy, according to the US Census Bureau, a trade gap that has persisted for decades and become an ever more sensitive subject in Washington.

US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the revised tariffs were justified because China was stealing US intellectual property. But Tai recommended tariff exclusions for hundreds of industrial machinery import categories from China, including 19 for solar product manufacturing equipment.

The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between Biden and Trump, his Republican predecessor, to show who’s tougher on China.

Asked to respond to Trump’s comments that China was eating the US’s lunch, Biden said of his rival, “He’s been feeding them a long time.” The Democrat said Trump had failed to crack down on Chinese trade abuses as he had pledged he would do during his presidency.

Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s press secretary, called the new tariffs a “weak and futile attempt” to distract from Biden’s own support for EVs in the United States, which Trump says will lead to layoffs at car factories.

Administration officials said their measures are combined with domestic investment in key industries and unlikely to worsen a bout of inflation that has already angered US voters.

Biden has struggled to convince voters of the efficacy of his economic policies despite a backdrop of low unemployment and above-trend economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showed Trump had a seven percentage-point edge over Biden on the economy.

Analysts have warned that a trade tiff could raise costs for EVs overall, hurting Biden’s climate goals and his aim to create manufacturing jobs.

Biden has said he wants to win this era of competition with China but not to launch a trade war. He has worked in recent months to ease tensions in one-on-one talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Both 2024 US presidential candidates have departed from the free-trade consensus that once reigned in Washington, a period capped by China’s joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. Trump’s broader imposition of tariffs during his 2017-2021 presidency kicked off a tariff war with China.

As part of the long-awaited tariff update, Biden will increase tariffs this year from 25 percent to 100 percent on EVs, bringing total duties to 102.5 percent, from 7.5 percent to 25 percent on lithium-ion EV batteries and other battery parts and from 25 percent to 50 percent on photovoltaic cells used to make solar panels. Some critical minerals will have their tariffs raised from nothing to 25 percent.

More tariffs will follow in 2025 and 2026 on semiconductors, as well as lithium-ion batteries that are not used in electric vehicles, graphite and permanent magnets, as well as rubber medical and surgical gloves.

A number of lawmakers have called for massive hikes on Chinese vehicle tariffs or an outright ban over data privacy concerns. There are relatively few Chinese-made light-duty vehicles being imported now.

The United Auto Workers, a politically important union that endorsed Biden, said the tariff moves would ensure that “the transition to electric vehicles is a just transition.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/14/biden-slaps-new-tariffs-on-chinese-imports-ratcheting-trade-war,NEGATIVE,0.9904047250747681
Joe biden,Biden suggests creating initiative to rival China’s Belt and Road,"United States President Joe Biden said he suggested to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a phone call on Friday that democratic countries should have an infrastructure plan to rival China’s Belt and Road initiative.

“I suggested we should have, essentially, a similar initiative, pulling from the democratic states, helping those communities around the world that, in fact, need help,” Biden told reporters.

China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure scheme launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping involving development and investment initiatives that would stretch from East Asia to Europe.

The project would significantly expand China’s economic and political influence, raising concerns in the US and elsewhere.

Biden’s remarks came after he said on Thursday he would prevent China from passing the US to become the most powerful country in the world, pledging to invest heavily to ensure the US prevails in the ever-growing rivalry between the world’s two largest economies.

Biden plans to unveil a multitrillion-dollar plan to upgrade US infrastructure next week. He said on Thursday this would ensure increased US investment in promising new technologies, such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and biotechnology.

While airing its concerns and seeking to encourage private sector-investment for overseas projects to rival those of the BRI, Washington has yet to be able to convince countries that it can offer an alternative to the state-backed economic vision put forward by Beijing under BRI.

More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure. According to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion were linked to the initiative.

However, China said last year that about 20 percent of BRI projects had been “seriously affected” by the coronavirus pandemic.

There has also been pushback against BRI from countries that have criticised projects as costly and unnecessary. Beijing scaled back some plans after several countries sought to review, cancel or scale down commitments, citing concerns about costs, erosion of sovereignty, and corruption.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/26/biden-suggests-creating-initiative-to-rival-chinas-belt-and-road,NEGATIVE,0.9757028222084045
Joe biden,Joe Biden pardons son Hunter: What it means and why it matters,"US President Joe Bidenhas pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases related to tax evasion and the purchase of a firearm.

Here is what we know about the case and the pardon:

Hunter Biden is Joe Biden’s 54-year-old middle child. He is also his only surviving son and the first child of a sitting US president to face criminal trial.

In a 2021 memoir, Hunteradmittedto crack cocaine use and alcoholism, although he said he received treatment and recovered from his addictions.

Hunter faced the possibility of years in federal prison due to multiple charges related togun possessionand tax fraud.

In June, he was convicted by a jury for illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while being a drug user. Hunter had the .38 calibre Colt Cobra Special for approximately 11 days and never fired it, according to his lawyers.







Months later, in September, he pleaded guilty to charges of a scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4m in taxes.

For the tax case, he faced up to 17 years in prison, and the gun charges were punishable by up to 25 years. Still, Hunter was expected to receive a shorter sentence, and it was possible he could have avoided prison time entirely.

Hunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced on December 12 on the gun-related charges in Delaware and on December 16 on thetax chargesin California.

Indeed.

In June, Biden ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son. “I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him,” Biden said as his son was facing trial in the Delaware gun case.

Separately, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at least seven times – over more than a year – that Biden would not pardon his son.

As Biden faced off against former President Donald Trump in this year’s presidential election, he tried to draw a distinction with the realtor-turned-politician – who has been charged in multiple cases.

“No one is above the law,” he wrote on X in early July, in seeming protest against the US Supreme Court verdict granting broad immunity to Trump for any legal violations he committed while president.

No one is above the law.

In a statement by the White House on Sunday, Biden announced his decision to grant executive clemency to his son, Hunter Biden.

Biden explained that this decision was made in response to what he described as a politically motivated attack orchestrated by his opponents, to damage his reputation.

“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Biden said in the statement.

“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong.”

Biden also emphasised, “I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. … I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.”

Statement from President Biden

“Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter…”

— CSPAN (@cspan)December 2, 2024



Hunter said in a statement he would never take the reprieve “for granted”.

“I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,” he said in a statement.

“I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.”

The US Constitution says a president has the power to grant clemency, which includes pardons, amnesty, commutation and reprieve.

A pardon absolves individuals of federal criminal offences and restores all civil liberties and rights, while a commutation lessens penalties without completely removing them. An amnesty is the same as a pardon but it’s extended to a group of individuals.

This power originates from English law, where the king could show mercy to anyone, and it later travelled across the Atlantic Ocean to the American colonies. US presidents often use this authority.

It’s not uncommon for US presidents to use this power to pardon or commute the sentence of a family member.

In his final weeks in office in 2021, Donald Trump issued about 100 pardons and commutations. Among the people he pardoned wereCharles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

In 2005, Kushner was sentenced to two years for tax evasion, illegal campaign donations, and witness tampering. Fast forward to 2024, and Charles Kushner has just been nominated by Trump to serve as US ambassador to France in the incoming administration.

Former President Bill Clinton, before the end of his second term, pardoned his half-brother Roger. In 1985, Roger Clinton Jr. was convicted on a cocaine-related charge and sentenced to more than a year in prison after admitting guilt to conspiracy to distribute.

According to analysts, this pardon could undermine the credibility of the US democratic system – and the notion that the law is indeed the same for everyone.

“Now that an election is over and Joe Biden has no more races to run, I think that what we’re seeing now is a father who is steadfastly looking out for his son,” Eric Ham, a US political analyst, told Al Jazeera.

“I do believe that this will be a lingering question that many people will focus on, and I suspect that now there will be more eyes on any pardons that Joe Biden provides as he heads out the door. But also, I think it raises a much larger question of where the US stands now as a nation of laws,” he added.

Experts also suggest that this also places the US in a challenging position in its global role.

“It’s going to be very difficult for the US … as it tries to hammer other nations, including China, Russia, and North Korea,” Ham said.

“I think it blurs the lines, and I think it makes it difficult for the US to make those arguments. When you look at successive moves being made by Biden and Donald Trump, who ran on pardoningJanuary 6thinsurrectionists, I think the argument for the US becomes harder as the nation moves forward,” he explained.

“The law seems to only work for or doesn’t work for certain people,” Ham added.

Both Biden and Trump have alleged that the Department of Justice has been influenced by politics.

Biden argued that the case was used to attack him and oppose his election. Trump has also argued that the justice system has been weaponised against him and he is a victim of prosecution.

After Biden announced the pardon for Hunter, Trump called the move an abuse of justice.

“Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?”  Trump said in a social media post. He was referring to the rioters who were accused of attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.

“Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!” he added.

Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol after he delivered a fiery speech urging the crowd to “fight like hell”, in a bid to stop Congress from certifying results of the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Biden.

Republican Iowa Senator Charles E Grassley said on social media that he was “shocked” that the president had pardoned his son because “he said many many times he wouldn’t & I believed him. Shame on me.”

I’m shocked Pres Biden pardoned his son Hunter bc he said many many times he wouldn’t & I believed him Shame on me

Joe biden,US Election 2024,"The White House on Monday hit back at critics who have cited recent videos of United States President Joe Biden to suggest he is mentally impaired and physically frail, less than six months before presidential elections in which he is expected to take on his predecessor Donald Trump.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre accused some of the videos of Biden, wherein he appears unresponsive or seems to be wandering off on his own, of being modified to create what are being described as“cheap fakes”.









So what are cheap fakes? Is the 81-year-old Biden a victim? And how are they different from deepfakes?

The term “cheap fake” was created by Britt Paris and Joan Donovan, co-authors of Deepfakes and Cheap Fakes: The Manipulation of Audio and Visual Evidence.

Creators of cheap fakes take real source videos and manually edit them — changing what is seen in them and even removing parts that lend context to what’s actually happening.

Cheap fakes require minimal editing and no significant technology. All they need are techniques like slowing a video down or making it fast, cropping parts of the video, or clipping a part of the full duration.

They can constitute “conspiracy theories”, Thomas Zeitzoff, author of Nasty Politics: The Logic of Insults, Threats, and Incitement, told Al Jazeera.

Their low cost and ease of production make them viral on social media while causing many issues for fact-checkers.

They are very different — though they both serve the purpose of misleading viewers.

Unlike cheap fakes, deepfakes are usually videos that are manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques.

Some deepfakes are entirely created from scratch using AI, rather than taking real videos and doctoring them. That makes them fundamentally different from cheap fakes, which count on genuine videos.

This distinction also makes cheap fakes harder to identify as motivated by an intent to manipulate, since the telltale signs of a deepfake — including any AI usage — are absent. After all, ordinary people edit their videos, too.

In a now-viral clip, Biden and other leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) bloc of nations are seen watching a skydiving demonstration during their recent summit in Italy. Then, Biden appears to aimlessly wander off on his own, away from the other leaders, until Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni walks up to him, takes him by the arm, and brings him back to the group, at which point the leaders appear to pose for a photo.

Here is the video that was posted by the RNC Research account – which is maintained by the Republican National Committee – on June 13:

However, according to White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates, Biden was not walking off aimlessly. Instead, he was trying to temporarily acknowledge one of the other parachuters with a congratulatory thumbs-up.

Biden, already the oldest serving US president, will be 86 by the time he completes his second term if re-elected in November. And though Trump, 78, is only three years younger and has made several gaffes of his own in recent weeks, the former president has consistently tried to paint Biden as physically and mentally incapable of handling the pressures of the job.

While Biden’s team insists the president’s health indicators are good, and that he remains alert and able to perform all aspects of his job, many Americans appear to disagree.

According to a New York Times/Siena College poll released in March, 73 percent of registered US voters said they believed Biden was too old to be an effective president. By contrast, 42 percent said the same about Trump.

Ahead of the November election, Zeitzoff said he expects instances of attempts at what he calls “nasty politics” to increase. That happens, he said, “when those elections are viewed as critical, pivotal, and or the parties are polarised”.

“Unfortunately, we are likely to see an increase in political attacks and likely actual violence,” he added.

This is not the first time that cheap fakes have created waves. In 2019, a clip of then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaking at an event was altered to give the impression that she was slurring her words, with some suggesting she was intoxicated.

In reality, the original video had been considerably slowed down to give the false impression that Pelosi was unable to speak properly.

In another cheap fake incident, in 2018, a video clip of then-Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was edited to show the crowd chanting for him. In reality, the original clip included chants against him.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/18/white-house-says-joe-biden-is-a-victim-of-cheap-fakes-what-are-they,NEGATIVE,0.9991583824157715
Joe biden,Biden takes aim at oligarchs and extreme wealth in farewell address,"United States President Joe Biden has used his final formal address as president to warn of the dangers of “oligarchy” and “extreme wealth” to democracy, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to begin his second term with an administration stacked with billionaires.

“Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,” Biden said in the televised address from the Oval Office in the White House on Wednesday night.

Biden’s speech comes five days before Trump’s inauguration on January 20 and mere hours after Israel and Hamas announced they had agreed to aceasefire in Gaza, an outcome that appeared to evade the Biden administration for months despite widespread opposition to the war among many Americans.

In his speech, Biden warned of “a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a few ultra-wealthy people” and “dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked”.

President-elect Trump’s incoming administration has at least 11 billionaires holding official positions, according to the Democratic Party. They include the world’s richest man, billionaireElon Musk, who Trump has said will co-lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.







Biden also warned that “powerful forces” threatened to undo his climate achievements, asunprecedented wildfiresburn in Los Angeles, the second-largest city in the US.

Biden began his speech by briefly referring to the newly announced ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has partly attributed to Trump.

“After eight months of nonstop negotiation by my administration, a ceasefire and a hostage deal has been reached by Israel and Hamas,” Biden said.

Biden added that while his team had negotiated the deal, he had told them to keep the “incoming administration fully informed” since it would be “largely implemented” by them.

While claiming the ceasefire as an achievement of his presidency, many voters in the 2024 presidential elections said they were unable to support the Democratic Party due to Biden’s dogged support for Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip.







Biden, 82, dropped out of contention for a second term in office after voters and his own party raised concerns over this performance in the first presidential election debate against then-Republican candidate Donald Trump, with Biden’s vice president,Kamala Harris, going on to contest the presidency and then losing to Trump.

Biden has used his final days in office to introduce a sweeping ban on offshore oil and natural gas drilling covering more than 625 million acres (253 million hectares) including the “entire US East Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico” and parts of the “Northern Bering Sea in Alaska”.

This has been seen as an apparent move to preempt Trump’s promise to “drill, baby drill” for oil “on day one” of his second term.

Biden said in his farewell address that “it will take time to feel the impact of all we’ve done together, but the seeds are planted, and they’ll grow, and they’ll bloom for decades to come”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/16/biden-takes-aim-at-oligarchs-and-extreme-wealth-in-farewell-address,NEGATIVE,0.9680845141410828
Joe biden,US Democrats formally nominate Joe Biden to take on Donald Trump,"The Democrats in the United States have formally nominated Joe Biden as their presidential candidate, designating the veteran leader as their challenger to President Donald Trump in the November election.

In a virtual roll call vote on Tuesday, due to the coronavirus pandemic, all 50 US states and seven territories announced their tallies endorsing Biden.









“Well, thank you very, very much, from the bottom of my heart,” a beaming Biden said in a live video link as he celebrated the nomination.

“It means the world to me and my family,” he added, reminding viewers he will deliver a formal acceptance speech on Thursday at the conclusion of the four-day Democratic National Convention.

Biden’s nomination was a formality as he had already won the majority of the more than 3,900 delegates back in June.

After Biden formally became a nominee, his wife, Jill Biden, addressed the nation for the first time as the prospective first lady.

Jill, who holds a doctorate in education, gave impassioned remarks about the closure of schools across the US and the loss of lives due to the pandemic.

She recounted her life with Joe in the aftermath of the death of his first wife and daughter in a car crash in 1972 and testified to his strength of character following his son Beau’s death from cancer in 2018.

“There are those who want to tell us that our country is hopelessly divided, that our differences are reconcilable but that is not what I see over these last few months,” Jill said.

“We just need leadership worthy or our nation and worthy of you, honest leadership to bring us back together to recover from this pandemic and prepared for whatever else is next.”

After her remarks, Joe called his wife: “The love of my life and the rock of our family.”

The convention included presentations by Democrats, including former Presidents Jimmy Carter, 95, and Bill Clinton, 74.

“At a time like this, the Oval Office should be a command centre. Instead, it’s a storm centre. There’s only chaos,” Clinton said.

“Just one thing never changes – his determination to deny responsibility and shift the blame,” he said. “The buck never stops there.”

Barack Obama will speak on Wednesday along with 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris.

On the day the Senate Intelligence Committee released a 1,000-page report on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, Democrats John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, and Sally Yates, a former deputy attorney general, criticised Trump’s unwillingness to address the issue.

“Donald Trump pretends Russia didn’t attack our elections,” Kerry said. “And now, he does nothing about Russia putting a bounty on our troops. So he won’t defend our country… The only person he’s interested in defending is himself.”

The Republican-led Senate committee report found that the FBI had ample cause to open an investigation into Trump’s 2016 campaign.

The report found that former campaign manager Paul Manafort, now serving a jail term for fraud, shared sensitive Trump campaign polling data with a Russian agent and was a counterintelligence threat.

Yates, who served as acting US Attorney General in the early days of the Trump administration, had warned the Trump White House about contacts with Russia in 2016-2017.

“From the moment President Trump took office, he has used his position to benefit himself rather than our country,” Yates said.

Trump claimed Obama and Biden directed US agencies to spy on his campaign in 2016 and denied coordinating with Russia, calling the Democratic allegations a “hoax”.

For a second night, the Democrats featured Republicans.

Colin Powell, who served as secretary of state under George W Bush and appeared at multiple Republican conventions in past years, endorsed Biden.

“Our country needs a commander in chief who takes care of our troops in the same way he would his own family. For Joe Biden, that doesn’t need teaching,” he said.

Powell said he learned the same values “growing up in the South Bronx” that Biden did growing up in Scranton, a blue-collar city in northeastern Pennsylvania.

A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top military position in the US, Powell’s support for Biden is likely to sway the votes of military personnel and their families concerned about national security.

A number of former Bush administration officials and military leaders have already formed a group to back Biden in the November election.

In addition to Powell, Cindy McCain, the widow of late Senator John McCain, provided her voice for a video that aired during Tuesday’s convention featuring Biden and McCain’s friendship.

The two were members of the Senate together for 20 years before Biden became Obama’s vice president.

While McCain publicly supported Trump as the Republican nominee in 2016, their relationship behind the scenes was strained, with Trump being dismissive of McCain’s record as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

With the convention, the Democrats hope Biden will get a boost in opinion polls, which show him ahead of Trump by an average of 50.2 percent to 42.5 percent, according to a survey by RealClearPolitics.com.

Next week, the Republicans will hold their convention to officially endorse President Trump’s bid to stay in power for another term.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/19/us-democrats-formally-nominate-joe-biden-to-take-on-donald-trump,POSITIVE,0.9991543292999268
Joe biden,US Election 2024,"An internal email obtained by The Associated Press news agency has revealed there was an internal disagreement at theWhite Houseover whom United States PresidentJoe Bidenreferred to as “garbage” earlier this week.

On Thursday, The Associated Press reported that it had obtained an email that showed White House officials altered the official transcript of a livestreamed video call in which Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Republican presidential candidateDonald Trump.

Two administration sources also confirmed to The Associated Press that the changes to the transcript drew objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity.

Earlier this week, Biden, 81, created uproar days before Election Day with his remarks on a video call with the nonprofit Voto Latino.

Fumbling with his words, Biden attempted to address the racist comments at a Trump rally made by comedianTony Hinchcliffe,who referred to the US island territory of Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage”.

According to the transcript prepared by official White House stenographers, Biden said: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters – his – his demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”

But the version released by the White House press office changed the comment by adding an apostrophe, having it read “supporter’s” rather than “supporters”.

That, in turn, made it appear as if Biden was referring specifically to the comedian Hinchcliffe and not Trump supporters at large.

The Associated Press said it obtained an internal email from the head of the stenographers’ office that showed the changes were made after the press office “conferred with the President”.

The authenticity of the email was confirmed by the two government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the news agency said.

The stenographers’ office is charged with preparing accurate transcripts of the public and private remarks made by the president for preservation by the National Archives and distribution to the public.

In the email, the head of the stenographers’ office called the unsanctioned changes “a breach of protocol and spoliation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices”.

​​“If there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,” the supervisor wrote, according to the news agency.

Biden quickly walked back his comments on Tuesday evening on social media, saying he was not calling all Trump supporters “garbage” but referring specifically to the “hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally”.

But the controversy over Biden’s remarks happened on the same night as Democratic presidential candidateKamala Harriswas set to make her “closing argument” at the National Mall in Washington, DC.

She has consistently campaigned on the message that it is important to treat Americans with different ideologies with respect.

The next day she distanced herself from the president’s comments.

“Let me be clear,” she told reporters. “I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.”

Republicans, already smarting from the negative public reaction to their New York rally, jumped on Biden’s comments as a retort to the outrage.

Many Trump surrogates said the remarks proved what Biden really thought of the millions of Americans who support Trump.

The next day, Trump donned an orange and yellow safety vest and got into the passenger seat of a garbage truck in Green Bay, Wisconsin, saying to reporters: “This is in honour of Kamala and Joe Biden.”

White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates did not comment directly on the changed transcript.

He told The Associated Press in a statement: “The President confirmed in his tweet on Tuesday evening that he was addressing the hateful rhetoric from the comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally. That was reflected in the transcript.”

House Republicans are now debating whether to launch an investigation, accusing White House staff of “releasing a false transcript” of Biden’s remarks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/transcript-of-bidens-garbage-remarks-altered-by-white-house-ap,NEGATIVE,0.999195396900177
Joe biden,Biden condemns Russia’s ‘outrageous’ Christmas attack on Ukraine,"United States President Joe Biden has labelled as “outrageous” a Russian Christmas day attack on Ukraine’s power grid, promising a “surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine”.

Moscow launched more than 170 missiles and drones on Ukraine on Wednesday, targeting Ukraine’senergy infrastructure. The strikes, which killed an energy worker, hit a thermal power plant and prompted Ukrainians to take shelter in metro stations on Christmas morning.

“The United States will continue to work tirelessly tostrengthen Ukraine’s positionin its defence against Russian forces,” the outgoing president said in a statement.

“The purpose of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people’s access to heat and electricity during winter and to jeopardise the safety of its grid,” Biden added.

The strikes on Ukrainian fuel and energy sources included 78 air, ground and sea-launched missiles as well as 106 Shaheds and other types of drones, Ukraine’s air force said. It claimed to have intercepted 59 missiles and 54 drones, with 52 more drones being jammed.

“Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack. What could be more inhumane?” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X. “The target is our energy infrastructure.”

This was the 13th large-scale strike on Ukraine’s energy system this year, the latest in Russia’s campaign targeting the power grid during winter.

Meanwhile, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) announced on Thursday that it had thwarted a plan by Ukrainian intelligence to kill senior Russian officers and their families in Moscow, according to the state-run TASS news agency.

Earlier this month, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, chief of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, was killed by Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service in Moscow when a bomb attached to an electric scooter exploded.

Russia on Thursday said five people had died in Ukrainian attacks and from a falling drone in the border region of Kursk and North Ossetia in the Caucasus on Wednesday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday cautioned that Russia would respond to Ukraine’s attacks, carried out with Western missiles and drones.

Russia targets only military facilities and infrastructure and “it’s not in our rules to strike civilian targets,” Lavrov said.

Ukraine officially celebrated Christmas on December 25 for the second time, after the government last year changed the date from January 7, when most Orthodox believers celebrate, as a snub to Russia.

Nearly 200 people paraded through the centre of Kyiv, singing Christmas carols.

The Christmas day attack also targeted Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, located near the Russian border. At least seven strikes sparked fires across the city, regional head Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. At least three people were injured, local authorities said.

Attacks continued overnight, with the Ukrainian military announcing on Thursday it shot down 20 drones out of 31 launched by Russia.

Outnumbered Ukrainian forces are now on the back foot across the front line in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions further south, ceding ground to better-equipped Russian troops.

Both sides are racing to secure an advantage before the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised a swift end to the conflict.

This has led to concerns that Washington might push Kyiv into accepting a settlement favourable to Moscow.

Joe biden,US President Joe Biden’s first 100 days in foreign policy,"United States President Joe Biden took office in January on apromise to trade in the “America first” approachof his predecessor, Donald Trump, for a diplomacy-heavy, human-rights-led foreign policy.

As Biden marks his first 100 days in the White House this week, observers say his administration has taken several steps towards that goal – including re-engaging with a number of international organisations and pressing for multilateral cooperation on global issues, such as climate change.

“Biden’s first 100 days pretty much came as advertised,” said PJ Crowley, the former US assistant secretary of state for public affairs under President Barack Obama.

Crowley pointed to the Biden administration’s tough line on China, its efforts to re-engage with Washington’s European allies, and its ongoing negotiations for a return to the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump unilaterally withdrew from in 2018, as examples of the shift.

But while Biden has a wholly different style from Trump, his foreign policy has not been a “wholesale rebuke” of his predecessor, Crowley told Al Jazeera.

That has garnered criticism from segments of the Democratic Party, who have urged Biden to take more progressive stances on a number of issues includingUS relations with Saudi Arabia, a low US refugee admissions cap, and arms sales to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

Here are some of Biden’s major foreign policy moves over his first 100 days:

On April 13, Biden announced the US wouldwithdraw all remaining US troops from Afghanistanby September 11, the 20-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that precipitated the US invasion of the country.

Biden pushed back a May 1 withdrawal deadline reached between the Trump administration and the Taliban, and his plan has been hailed by advocates who have long called on the US to end its so-called “forever wars”.









But critics have questioned whether the withdrawal would lead to renewed violence, leave the Afghan governmentill-equippedto hold onto territory, and make a peace agreement between the government and the Taliban more elusive.

The Biden administration has increasingly made competing with China – and countering Beijing’s economic and military assertiveness – a top priority, while promising a more nuanced approach that involves cooperation wherever possible.

While the US has continued tosanctionChinese officials for human rights abuses,impose tariffsin an ongoing trade dispute, and buildregional alliancesto counter Beijing, Biden administration officials traded barbs with their Chinese counterparts during an inaugural meeting in Alaska in March.

In an opening statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinkenvoiced“deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, and economic coercion toward our allies”.

His Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi then accused the US of “long-arm jurisdiction and suppression” and said many Americans have “little confidence in the democracy of the United States”, an apparent reference to storming of the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters in January.

Still, Chinese President Xi Jinping participated in a US-hosted climate summit last week,indicatingthe leaders are willing to work with each other on some global issues.

Biden’s promise to reset Trump-era policies at the southern border with Mexico have also been ad hoc amida surge in migrant and asylum seeker arrivals, the vast majority from Central America.

The Biden administration ended Trump’s so-called Remain in Mexico policy, which required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico – often in makeshift camps set up along the border – while their US asylum claims are processed. He also endedagreementswith El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras that allowed US authorities to deport asylum seekers who passed through one of those countries on their way to the US and send them back.







Nevertheless, the Biden administrationcontinues to useTitle 42, a Trump-era public health policy that allows authorities to expel most migrants at the border during the COVID-19 pandemic, though Biden has exempted unaccompanied minors.

Biden also faced swift rebuke for announcing he would not make good on a campaign promise tolift the historically low, Trump-era refugee admissions capof 15,000. After widespread backlash, the administration said it would announce a higher cap on May 15.

The Biden administration has twiceimposed sanctionsagainst Russia, first for the alleged poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and then for a raft of allegations including US elections meddling and hacking of an array of US federal agencies.







Biden has also taken a more confrontational tone with Russian President Vladimir Putin for his crackdown on dissent and build-up of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border, notablyconfirmingthat he believed Putin to be a “killer” in an interview in March.

Biden has offered to meet Putin for a summit in a European country in the coming weeks, although it remains unclear if that meeting will happen.

In February, the Biden administration announced anend to US supportfor offensive operations carried out by a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well as any “relevant arms sales”. The US has not provided concrete details of how this will work, however.

Biden officials are pushing for a diplomatic solution to endover six years of war in Yemen, which has led to a dire humanitarian crisis, and in its early days, the Biden administrationlifteda Trump-era designation of the Houthi movement as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), which observers said could hinder aid deliveries.







Before he was elected, Bidenpromised to “reassess” the US-Saudi relationship.

While Biden’s approach to the Gulf kingdom signals a shift from Trump, who unequivocally backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his administration has also been criticised for not sanctioning MBS after a US intelligence reportdirectly linkedhim to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Biden has also been criticised forproceedingwith a $23bn, Trump-era arms sale to the United Arab Emirates, also a member of the coalition fighting in Yemen. The sale includes F-35s, drones and other advanced equipment that critics say could further put Yemeni civilians at risk.

Iran

Biden has also sought a return to the Iran nuclear deal, an agreement reached under the administration of Obama, his former boss, that saw Tehran curtail its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.

Trump withdrew from the deal, which was opposed by Saudi Arabia and Israel, in 2018 and instead imposed a campaign of “maximum pressure” on Tehran.







Tehran and Washington had been stuck in a deadlock over who will make the first move in returning to the deal, butindirect talksin Vienna that include the other parties to the agreement – the UK, France, Germany, EU, China and Russia – are ongoing.

Israeli-Palestinian conflict

On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Biden administration hassignalledperhaps the most openness to maintaining Trump-era policies.







While Biden hasrenewedfunding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), he has also made it clear he will not reverse Trump’s relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem or his recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.

Biden administration officials also have said they plan to build on Trump-brokerednormalisation dealsbetween Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, which drew condemnation from Palestinians.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/29/us-president-joe-biden-first-100-days-in-foreign-policy,POSITIVE,0.970398485660553
Joe biden,Biden: ‘We have a deal’ on a bipartisan infrastructure plan,"United States President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of senators announced they have struck a deal on a $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan, a rare breakthrough in a deeply divided Washington, and one that faces a complicated path to passage in Congress.

“We have a deal,” Biden said, flanked by several Democratic and Republican senators, during a surprise appearance outside of the White House on Thursday.

Calling the deal “a true bipartisan effort”, Biden in a separate White House speech said, “There’s nothing our nation can’t do when we decide to do it together, do it as one nation.”

We’ve struck a deal. A group of senators – five Democrats and five Republicans – has come together and forged an infrastructure agreement that will create millions of American jobs.

— President Biden (@POTUS)June 24, 2021



The pared-down plan, with $579bn in new spending, has rare bipartisan backing and could open the door to the president’s more sweeping $4 trillion proposals later on.

One of the members of the Group of 21 senators, Republican Rob Portman said, “We didn’t get everything we wanted but we came up with a good compromise.”

He said they had commitments from Republicans and Democrats alike to get this thing “across the finish line”.

Included in the bipartisan agreement is traditional infrastructure spending on roads and bridges as well as new transport-related items such as building a national network of electric vehicle chargers, according to a fact sheet released by the White House.

Expanding broadband, upgrading the nation’s power infrastructure and replacing lead water pipes are among the other items in the proposal.

The agreement comes with a complex legislative push. Biden’s proposed larger-scale infrastructure package would be done separately in a congressional budget process known as reconciliation.

“They’re going to move on a dual track,” Biden explained.

His comments suggest that his plan to spendtrillionson broader “human infrastructure” priorities such as climate change, healthcare and childcare will move on one track in Congress as they work on passing this agreement at the same time.

This is a nod to progressive Democrats who have insisted a smaller deal be paired with his larger proposals.

“This is important,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before Biden’s announcement. “There ain’t going to be a bipartisan bill without a reconciliation bill.”







The Democratic leader promised the House would not vote on it until the Senate had dealt with both packages, starting with initial votes in July to consider the bipartisan deal and to launch the lengthy procedure for Biden’slargerproposals, which currently total almost $4 trillion but some progressive Democrats want a boost to $6 trillion.

That plan would run through the budget reconciliation process, which would allow passage of Biden’s priorities by majority vote, without the need for support from Republicans to overcome the Senate’s 60-vote threshold. It would require multiple rounds of voting that are likely to extend into fall.

Like Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, “One can’t be done without the other.”

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who was briefed on the plan early on Thursday, would not yet say whether he will back the initiative.

Before the White House meeting, Portman told reporters on Capitol Hill that McConnell “remains open-minded and he’s listening”. Portman added, “He hasn’t made his decision.”

McConnell did not respond later to questions from reporters about his position.







The main hurdle for a bipartisan agreement has been financing. Biden demanded no new taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 a year, while Republican lawmakers were unwilling to raise taxes beyond such steps as indexing the petrol tax to inflation.

With Republicans opposed to Biden’s proposed corporate tax rate increase, from 21 to 28 percent, the group has looked at other ways to raise revenue. Biden rejected their idea to allow gas taxes paid at the pump to rise with inflation, viewing it as a financial burden on American drivers.

The broad reconciliation bill would likely include tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, so tension still exists over funding for some Republicans and business groups.

That is a signal to both parties of the road ahead. Liberal Democrats have been wary of the bipartisan effort because they see it as insufficient and worry it will take the place of Biden’s bigger plan. Republicans are also sceptical of passing a bipartisan bill only to be faced with an even bigger Democratic plan.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/24/biden-we-have-a-deal-on-a-bipartisan-infrastructure-plan,POSITIVE,0.9986552000045776
Joe biden,Biden in Angola: What’s behind the last-ditch Africa trip?,"United States President Joe Biden is visiting Angola this week on his first-ever bilateral trip to Africa as president – weeks before he leaves the post toDonald Trump.

Biden arrived in the Angolan capital, Luanda, on Monday, after a brief stop in the West African nation of Cape Verde. The three-day trip to Angola, many analysts say, represents a final, desperate attempt to fulfil a promise Biden made long ago, and counter China’s expanding influence on the continent.

The anticipated visit,which was pushed back from Octoberdue to Hurricane Milton, will see Biden visit the Lobito Port, which is at the heart of US trade relations with Angola. There, he will assess an ongoing critical minerals infrastructure project that is set to see vast supplies of cobalt and copper delivered to the West.

Here’s what to know about Biden’sAfrica visitand why Lobito is important:

Analysts say Biden’s failure to visit any African country – except Egypt for COP27 in November 2022 – until now shows that his administration has not prioritised the continent.

Biden first promised to visit Africa in December 2022, two years into his presidency – which some note was already too late.

He made the promise at aUS-Africa leaders summitin Washington, where 49 African leaders gathered. The US “is all in on Africa and all in with Africa”, Biden declared at the time. He also announced a support package of $55bn to the African Union.

The Biden administration has hosted several African leaders in the White House, but the promised visit never materialised – until now.

“Presidential trips to Africa are rare enough that they always matter,” Cameron Hudson, a senior Africa analyst at the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Al Jazeera.

“This one would matter less coming as it does at the very end of a lame-duck presidency. Ironically, [an Africa trip] probably matters more to Biden, who is searching to establish a legacy in Africa…than for Africa, which is already preparing for his successor,” Hudson added.

Africa’s significant natural resources, rapidly growing population of 1.3 billion, and sizeable voting power in the United Nations – with 54 country votes – make the continent an increasingly important strategic player.

US influence on the continent has been waning for years, even as China and Russia have strengthened their presence in several countries.

China has since 2013 overtaken the US to become Africa’s largest trade partner. This year, the US lost a major spy base in the West African nation of Niger, and its army got kicked out of Chad. That has left it struggling to find a military foothold in the Sahel region which has become a hotspot of violence by a range of armed groups.

In 2022, the White House released anambitious Africa strategy documentthat shifted from the first Trump administration’s focus on trade relations.

Rather, the document promised, the US would push for Africa to have leadership roles at international platforms, including permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council and membership of the G20. Analysts lauded the approach as “modern” and “ambitious” at the time but enthusiasm for it quickly faded aslittle actionfollowed.

Several top officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have visited African countries at various times.

Meanwhile, Biden found time to travel elsewhere. He has visited the United Kingdom alone five times, apart from numerous other visits to Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.

In contrast, President Xi Jinping of China and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin have visited African countries at least twice as heads of state.

The visit to Luanda will see Biden focus on an $800m US-backed railway project in the Lobito Corridor. The passage is a strategic trade route that connects the resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia to Angola, which hosts the port of Lobito, located on the Atlantic Ocean.

Funded largely by the US and the European Union, the Lobito Atlantic Railway project will see an existing rail network in the Lobito Corridor upgraded. That would allow for the faster export of cobalt and copper, amongst other minerals, mined from the DRC’s Kolwezi mining town, to the West.

The DRC is one of the world’s largest producers of copper and cobalt. The minerals are key components of batteries that power electric vehicles, which the US and EU are eager to develop more of as demand for clean energy supply chains grows.

Washington has provided a $550m loan to start the project. The African Development Bank and the Africa Finance Corporation are also involved.

The rail line is about 1300km (800 miles) long and will likely see extensions into mineral-rich regions in Zambia. Portuguese company Trafigura is leading a three-company consortium that will operate the railway for 30 years under a concession agreement. In August, the company said it shipped the first container of minerals to the US via the Lobito Port.

Analysts say the US faces challenges in the corridor.Chinahas eyes on the region, too, and has already locked in much of the minerals that would theoretically be sold to Western countries within its huge Belt and Road Initiative, notes researcher E.D Wala Chabala in a paper for the Berlin-based think tank, Africa Policy Research Institute.

“Not only are the Chinese ubiquitously present on the African continent, but China is already far ahead in building supply chains for cobalt, lithium and several other essential metals and minerals,” Chabala wrote.

In September, China’s state engineering corporation signed a concession agreement to operate the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), another railway line in the corridor that links central Zambia to the port of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania.

US officials say the visit is meant to highlight the close ties between Angola and the US.

At present, Luanda is also playing a lead role in mediating a spat between the DRC and Rwanda, concerningongoing violence in eastern Congo.

Angola was, until a few years ago, a heavy borrower from China. It has also been historically close to Russia: During Angola’s 27-year civil war, the US and the former Soviet Union backed rival sides, leading to cold ties between Luanda and Washington.

However, the government of President Joao Lourenco, which has been in place since 2017, has favoured stronger ties with Washington. The two countries have deepened trade relations and by 2023, US-Angola trade totalled approximately $1.77bn. Angola is the US’s fourth-largest trade partner in sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2021, and more recently, in November 2023, Biden hosted President Lourenco at the White House.

However, analysts say Washington’s view of Lourenco’s government ignores alleged human rights violations under his watch. Lourenco is unpopular amongst many Angolans due to high living costs, corruption, and mounting crackdowns on dissent. In June, authorities opened fire on protesters angry at inflation, killing eight people in the central Huambo province. Several others were arrested in cities across the country.

Analysts say Biden’s refusal to acknowledge those concerns over alleged rights abuses is a stain on his legacy.

“Many observers believe that Biden’s visit may inadvertently embolden an unpopular president,” said Florindo Chivucute, director of Friends of Angola, a group advocating for stronger democratic values in Angola and based in Luanda and Washington, DC.

“While the US lags behind China in terms of trade and political influence in Angola, it should not compromise its core values of democracy and human rights in an attempt to catch up,” he said.

While President Biden has finally fulfilled his promise to visit Africa, his administration hasn’t been able to accomplish some of the other goals it set for itself.

The African Union was admitted as a permanent member of the G20 in September 2023. However, no African country is still a permanent member of the UNSC.

In September 2024, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced that her country would support two permanent UNSC seats for Africa. However, she warned that those seats would not have veto power, a position that many analysts criticised because it would set up a two-tier system – one for UNSC members with vetoes, and the second for those without that power.

A Trump presidency, meanwhile, is likely to focus only on trade relations, as it did the first time, experts say.

The incoming administration will likely want to compete with Chinese and Russian influence, and land access to critical minerals, Tibor Nagy, a top envoy to Africa under the last Trump administration, told the Reuters news agency.

There, at least, projects like the Lobito Railway could see sustained US investment. “This checks both boxes,” Nagy said, referring to the railway project.

Joe biden,Most Democrats want someone other than Biden to run in 2024: Poll,"Only 26 percent of Democratic respondents wantJoe Bidento be the party’s nominee in the next presidential election, a new poll has found, highlighting the United States president’s dwindling popularity even amongst supporters who backed him in 2020.

The New York Times-Siena College poll (PDF) released on Monday also showed the president’s overall approval rating at 33 percent.

David Cohen, a political science professor at The University of Akron in Ohio, said the numbers are “pretty terrible” for Biden.

“There is no way to sugar-coat it,” Cohen told Al Jazeera. “Just about any way you cut it, they’re not good. And the Biden White House has got to be very worried about not only potential re-election chances, but his current standing with the American public, which across the board is under water.”

The poll comes after a number of US media outletsreportedthat many Democratic officials do not want Biden to seek re-election in 2024.

Sitting US presidents rarely face competitive primaries, as the party in power usually looks to capitalise on the advantage of incumbency.

But amid spiralling inflation,global crisesand the US Supreme Court’s recentdecisionto overturn constitutionally protected abortion rights, the poll found that 64 percent of Democrats said the party should nominate a different candidate in 2024.

Of those, 33 percent cited the president’s age as the most important reason behind their position. Biden is already theoldest presidentin US history at 79 years old. If re-elected, he would be 82 by the time of his second inauguration in January 2025.

Meanwhile, 32 percent of the same group of respondents said the president’s job performance is why they don’t want him to be re-nominated in 2024.

The survey interviewed 849 US registered voters, and has a 4.1 percent margin of error.

Biden and his top aides have repeatedly said that he intends to run for re-election. The president’s allies say he is doing his best to mitigate problems outside of his control, including risinggas pricesand global supply chain issues.

To be clear, as the President has said repeatedly, he plans to run in 2024.

— Karine Jean-Pierre (@PressSec)June 13, 2022



Cohen said even if Biden is not responsible for some of the crises Americans are dealing with, the president is the first person people blame. “You get to take credit when the economy is good. And you get blamed when the economy’s bad,” he told Al Jazeera.

The professor noted a scathing finding in the poll for Biden – his unpopularity amongstyounger voters.

The president’s approval rating drops to 19 percent with 18- to 29-year-old voters in Monday’s poll. And in the same age group amongst Democratic respondents, 94 percent want a different candidate to be the party’s nominee in 2024.

“That’s a real problem for Biden because that is a natural part of the Democratic base that he should be doing much better with,” Cohen said of young voters.

Despite the overall gloomy picture that the poll paints for Biden, there is one silver lining for the US president: Voters would favour him – 44 to 41 percent – in a potential electoral re-match against his predecessorDonald Trump.

“It shows that Donald Trump is an extremely flawed candidate as well, and a majority of the country would not want to go down that road again with Trump,” Cohen said. “Donald Trump may be the best hope for Joe Biden winning a potential second term.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/11/most-democrats-want-someone-other-than-biden-to-run-in-2024-poll,NEGATIVE,0.9989340901374817
Joe biden,Biden warns Russia could attack Ukraine within days,"US President Joe Biden has warned there is every indication Russia is planning to invade Ukraine, including signs Moscow is carrying out a false flag operation to justify it, afterUkrainian forces and pro-Moscow rebelstraded fire.

Moscow, for its part, on Thursday ejected the number two official from the US embassy and released a strongly worded letter accusing Washington of ignoring its security demands. It threatened unspecified “military-technical measures”.

Early morning exchanges of fire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine raised alarm, with Western officials who have long warned that Moscow could try to create a pretext for an invasion saying they believed such a scenario was now unfolding.

“We have reason to believe they are engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in. Every indication we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine and attack Ukraine,” Biden said at the White House. “My sense is it will happen in the next several days.”

Biden ordered Secretary of State Antony Blinken to change his travel plans at the last minute to speak at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Ukraine.

Addressing the council, Blinken sketched out in graphic detail how Washington contends any Russian attack would begin and unfold.

“Missiles and bombs drop across Ukraine, communications will be jammed, cyberattacks will shut down Ukrainian institutions,” Blinken told the UNSC.

“After that, Russian tanks and soldiers will advance on key targets that have already been identified and mapped out in detailed plans.”

The US has declined to share the evidence underlying its claims.

Russia denies planning to invade its neighbour and said this week it was pulling back some of themore than 100,000 soldiersit has massed near the frontier. Washington says Russia is not withdrawing, but in fact sending more forces.

Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels gave conflicting accounts of shelling across the front in theDonbasregion in eastern Ukraine.

The details could not be established independently, but reports from both sides suggested an incident more serious than the ceasefire violations reported regularly in the area.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said pro-Russian forces had shelled a daycare centre, in what he called a “big provocation”.

Video footage released by Ukrainian police showed a hole through a brick wall in a room scattered with debris and children’s toys.

The separatists, for their part, accused government forces of opening fire on their territory four times in the past 24 hours.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was “seriously concerned” about the reports of an escalation. Russia has long accused Kyiv of planning to provoke escalation as an excuse to seize rebel territory by force, which Ukraine denies.

UN Political Affairs Chief Rosemary DiCarlo said, “Whatever one believes about the prospect of such a confrontation, the reality is that the current situation is extremely dangerous.”

Britain’s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called unrest at the front line “a blatant attempt by the Russian government to fabricate pretexts for invasion”.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was “concerned that Russia is trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine”.

“They have enough troops, enough capabilities to launch a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine with very little or no warning time,” he said.

Meanwhile, the US State Department said Russia had provided no explanation for its decision to eject Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman from the US embassy in Moscow.

“Russia’s action against our DCM was unprovoked and we consider this an escalatory step and are considering our response,” a spokesperson said.

Al Jazeera’s Rosalind Jordan, reporting from Washington, DC, said Gorman was a “longtime career diplomat, the number two person with a lot of experience” in dealing with security matters.

“The pretext the US says that Mr Gorman was expelled, had nothing to do with his length of service. They say that he still had time on his visa to continue his service,” Jordan added.

“They also said that the Russian government has degraded the number of people who can work at the US mission in Moscow to a level a lot lower than here in Washington at the Russian embassy. The State Department says that is very worrisome at a time when there needs to be more diplomatic contact between the two governments.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/17/us-says-war-appears-imminent-after-shelling-on-ukraine-front-line,NEGATIVE,0.9973487854003906
Joe biden,Western Sahara: What’s at stake for Joe Biden?,"It was a visit that would go down in the annals of Moroccan history.

US Ambassador David Fischer on Sunday began the process of establishing a consulate in the Western Saharan city of Dakhla.

“It is such an honour for me to visit this stunningly beautiful and critically important region of Morocco, and to begin the process of establishing a US diplomatic presence here,” Fischer said.

The highly anticipated trip came a month after Trump announced in a tweet that the United States had recognised Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara in exchange for the kingdom normalising ties with Israel.

Rabat had long laid claim to the territory, a Spanish colony up until 1975.

But the recognition raised eyebrows in Washington and elsewhere with many observers saying the move was not only in contravention of international law, but also likely to lead to a flare-up in tensions between the kingdom and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, a movement seeking independence for the territory.

Critics of the agreement say it undermines a United Nations-led process to find a permanent solution to the conflict, which the world body said rests on a referendum for the Indigenous Sahrawi people to decide on their fate: independence or autonomy within a wider federation.

Morocco has consistently refused to entertain the prospect of independence for the Sahrawi, saying only autonomy was on the table.

As Trump’s time in the oval office approaches its end, Al Jazeera takes a look at the stakes involved for the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden and the deal’s implications for the region.

Analysts say by recognising Morocco’s claims over Western Sahara, Washington is effectively undermining international law and the mechanisms by which conflicts are resolved.

This is something that House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel explicitly referred to in his criticism of the move.

“Casting aside legitimate multilateral avenue of conflict resolution only empowers countries like Russia and China to continue trampling on international rules and norms and rewards those who violate borders and the right of free people,” Engel said at the time of the announcement.

Similarly, while welcoming Morocco’s normalisation of ties with Israel, Republican Senator James Inhofe lamented Trump’s abandoning of Sahrawi people’s right to self-determination, saying it was a universal principle that remained consistent across US administrations.

“The African Union, the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, and the European Union have all agreed – the Sahrawi people have the right to decide their own future,” Ihofe said.

“The president has been poorly advised by his team, he could have made this deal without trading the rights of a voiceless people.”

Observers have presented a potential reversal of Trump’s recognition of Morocco’s territorial claim as an easy win for the incoming Biden administration.

“Derecognition is already commonplace in this conflict and it would mean realigning with other international players’ position in the conflict,” said Joseph Huddleston, assistant professor at Seton Hall University’s School of Diplomacy and International Relations.

Recognition has historically gone both ways as far as the Western Sahara conflict is concerned.

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), as it is officially known, has seen the number of countries that recognise its sovereignty over the territory drop to 40 from more than double that number 30 years ago.

Several African countries have also acted against the official position of the African Union, of which SADR is a founding member, to open consulates in Western Sahara.

The Biden administration would incur a cost for a reversal, according to Huddleston, but it pales in comparison to the consequences for other countries seeking unilateral territorial expansion.

“At a very low cost, Biden can signal a new commitment to diplomacy, international law and cooperation, and bipartisan policy-making, not to mention the cherished principle of individual liberty and self-determination,” Huddleston told Al Jazeera.

Proponents of Trump’s recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty over the territory maintain it will lead to greater stability, with the kingdom better able and equipped to tackle transnational threats harming the North Africa region and Europe.

Indeed, within a day of the agreement’s signing, the US government announced it was moving ahead with $1bn in sales of drone and other precision-guided weapons to Morocco.

Still, some analysts fear the deal will lead to more conflict in this volatile part of the world already wracked by a decade of war in Libya, as well as conflict in Mali and the surrounding Sahel region.

In November, the Polisario, the movement seeking independence for Western Sahara, abandoned a 29-year-old ceasefire agreement after Morocco intervened in the border town of Guerguerat near Mauritania to end a sit-in by Sahrawi activists and restore the “free circulation of civilian and commercial traffic”.

That episode highlighted just how susceptible the region was to armed confrontation between the two sides.

The conflict “increases the risk that some of the complex constellation of armed groups in the Sahel may be pulled into war”, recently wrote Andrew Lebovich, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

This would prolong and further complicate the conflict, turning Western Sahara into a complex theatre akin to that of Libya, with neighbouring Algeria potentially weighing in, if only logistically, to support the Polisario, he said.

Joe biden,US Election 2024,"Calls are mounting for US President Joe Biden to step aside as the Democratic Party candidate, following his poor performance in a presidential debate against Republican candidate Donald Trump.

The 81-year-old president’s faltering presentation during the June 27 debate has sparked questions and doubts about his ability to lead for another four years. During the debate, Biden appeared to lose his train of thought and at times looked exhausted or confused.

A damage control campaign has since followed, with the president and his backers scrambling to assure voters that he is fit andwon’t be stepping aside.

But some within the Democratic camp seem dissatisfied; the list of representatives calling for a Biden drop-out is now growing.

Here’s what we know about how the debate has affected Biden and who a replacement candidate might be:

The most significant impact of Biden’s debate performance is that it intensified doubts about his capacity – which now threatens his ability to win the presidential elections in November, experts note. That adds to simmering dissatisfaction with how Biden’s government has handled inflation,the Gaza warand immigration on the southern border with Mexico.

An Ipsos pollshowedthat after the presidential debate, voter confidence in Biden’s mental fitness dropped from 28 percent to 20 percent.

Presidential debates have been an important part of US elections since first airing in 1960 and have proved crucial in shifting voters towards the better speaker.

After the Sunday debate, voter preferences have shifted towards Trump by an average of 3.5 points, according to one analysis by the Brookings Institution, a US think-tank. Prior to the debate, Trump was ahead of Biden by an average of 1.5 points.

Another opinion poll by Ipsos showed that post-debate voter support for both candidates wastiedat 40 percent.

Analysts say even small shifts are crucial in what’s set to be a tight election in a country deeply polarised along political ideologies.

Within the Democratic Party, five members of the US House of Representatives have called for Biden to step aside: Representatives Seth Moulton (Massachusetts), Lloyd Doggett (Texas), Raul Grijalva (Arizona), Mike Quigley (Illinois) and Angie Craig (Minnesota).

On Sunday, a separate group of Democrats at a virtual meeting convened by the House minority leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries (New York), discussed how to pressure Biden to step aside, according to The Associated Press.



It’s nearly unprecedented for a nominee to step down so close to the elections. If that happens, Democrats would have tofield another candidate.

President Biden could step down and simply nominate Vice President Kamala Harris to carry on, but her approval ratings have not been much higher than Biden’s, casting doubt on her ability to floor Trump.

However, Harris would inherit Biden’s campaign funds, whereas any other nominees would be starting their campaigns from scratch, campaign finance lawyer Steve Roberts toldThe Hill.

If Biden steps down before the August 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, one of the more likely scenarios is that the party willnominate another candidateto run in his place. Democrats last used this method in 1968, after the leading candidate, Senator Robert F Kennedy, was assassinated just weeks before the convention.

The Democratic Party could also force Biden out by invoking the25th Amendment, which provides that if the president dies, is disabled or resigns, the vice president assumes the role. The VP and a majority of Democrats in Congress could invoke the act by declaring to the speaker of the house and the Senate that the president is not fit, and should be removed. The president could contest this declaration. If the VP and a majority of lawmakers disagree, the matter would be put to a two-thirds majority vote in Congress.

Donors have considerable power, but it’s unclear how they might affect a potential nomination.

Somedonorsto the Biden campaign have joined the list of people asking Biden to step down, including former PayPal CEO William “Bill” Harris.

Harris, who donated $620,000 to the Biden campaign in 2020, told reporters last week that Biden’s departure is “inevitable”. Harris is now leading a group of donors pledging $2m to fund a series of debates among Democratic candidates that would set the stage for another candidate to be selected.

Some are threatening to withhold donations to the Democrats until Biden steps down, putting pressure not just on the president, but the entire party.

In an opinion piece on the website Deadline, Hollywood producer Damon Lindelof urged fellow donors to impose a “DEMbargo”.

Lindelof wrote: “When they text you asking for cash, text back that you’re not giving them a penny and you won’t change your mind until there’s change at the top of the ticket.”

For now, there have been no such calls from the Biden campaign’sbiggest donors. Political action group Future Forward USA Action and venture capital firms Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital are the top three donors for the Biden campaign, according to the website OpenSecrets.

Some have put forward Michelle Obama as a likely nominee, but the former first lady has repeatedly said “no”. Yet50 percent of those polledsaid they would vote for Obama if she were on the ticket, putting her seven points ahead of Trump.

Joe biden,"Biden, Bennett to discuss Iran’s ‘out of the box’ nuclear program","President Joe Biden will tell Israel’s Naftali Bennett that the US is looking to roll back Iran’s nuclear programme through diplomacy but also has “other avenues to pursue”, a senior US official told reporters ahead of the two leaders’meeting.

Bennett, who is meeting Biden for the first time since becoming Israel’s prime minister, has voiced opposition to US efforts to restore the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

The administration official, briefing reporters ahead of Thursday’s talks between Biden and Bennett, faulted former President Donald Trump for nixing the multilateral agreement, which opened the door for Iran to accelerate its nuclear programme.

“Since the last administration left the Iran nuclear deal, Iran’s nuclear program has just dramatically broken out of the box, and it’s accelerating from week to week,” the official said.

“This is a very serious problem, and the two leaders, I think, will have the opportunity to sit together and discuss what to do about it.”

The deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), granted Iran relief from international sanctions in exchange for scaling back its nuclear programme.







Trump left the agreement in 2018 and started piling sanctions on the Iranian economy as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign. Tehran responded by gradually loosening its commitments to the JCPOA, including limits on uranium enrichment.

Biden, who served as vice president to Barack Obama when the pact was signed, campaigned on restoring the agreement, but six rounds of indirect talks with Iran in Vienna earlier this year have failed to reinstate the JCPOA.

Bennett’s predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, was a fierce opponent of the agreement. The current Israeli prime minister has made it clear that his country’s stance has not changed.

Bennett told the New York Times earlier this week that he would present Biden with a new strategy to confront Iran, including by strengthening Israel’s alliance with some Arab countries and continuing covert Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Israel signed normalisation agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco last year.

“What we need to do, and what we are doing, is forming a regional coalition of reasonable Arab countries, together with us, that will fend off and block this expansion and this desire for domination,” he said of Iran.







Earlier this week, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US is still committed to reviving the nuclear deal despite talks with Tehran stalling with a new conservative government taking office in Iran under PresidentEbrahim Raisi.

“We have made very clear that it remains profoundly in our national interest to seek to effect a mutual return to compliance of the JCPOA,” Price said.

On Wednesday, the administration official said while the US is “committed” to diplomacy with Iran, its approach is “multidimensional”.

The US thinks reviving the JCPOA is the best way to roll back the Iranian nuclear programme, ” but obviously if that doesn’t work, there are other avenues to pursue,” the official said.

Bennett met with Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday.

“Our commitment to this partnership, to Israel’s security, is and always will be unshakable,” Blinken said ahead of the meeting.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/25/biden-bennett-to-discuss-irans-out-of-the-box-nuclear-program,POSITIVE,0.9682244062423706
Joe biden,Biden unveils new Russia sanctions over Ukraine invasion,"Washington, DC –United States President Joe Biden has announced new sanctions against Russia, vowing to impose a “severe cost” on the country for itsinvasion of Ukraine.

Speaking from the White House on Thursday, Biden voiced support for Ukraine and saidthe sanctions packagewill limit international trade with Moscow and penalise Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

“Putin is the aggressor; Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences,” Biden said.

The sanctions target four Russian banks that hold more than $1 trillion in assets, including the country’s largest bank, Sberbank. “That means every asset they have in America will be frozen,” the US president said.

Biden also said the sanctions will target wealthy Russians close to Putin. “We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead,” he pledged.

Thursday’s measures did not target the Russian president personally, but Biden said sanctioning Putin is “on the table”.

The US move comes afterRussia launched a large-scale military operationin Ukraine late on Wednesday after a months-long impasse in the region that saw Moscow amass as many as 200,000 troops near the Ukrainian border.

European countries began imposing sanctions on Russia over the invasion on Thursday, with the United Kingdom announcingmeasurestargeting dozens of Russian banks, businesses and wealthy elites, and banning Russia’s national airline Aeroflot from the country’s airspace.

Putin saidRussia is aiming for the “demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine” but does not plan on occupying the country. Russianforces bombed targetsacross Ukraine throughout the night.

Ukrainian officials have said fighting also is taking place on the ground, with Russian forces on Thursday capturing the former nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, in the country’s north.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law late on Wednesday, and pledged that Ukrainians would defend themselves against the invasion. “When you will be attacking us, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces,”Zelenskyy said.

Putin had accused the Ukrainian government of committing atrocities in the east of the country where government forces had been battling Russia-backed separatists since 2014, but Ukrainian officials have repeatedly denied attacking the pro-Moscow rebels.



Russia initially denied US and European allegations that it was planning to invade Ukraine, insisting that it has legitimatesecurity concernsover Kyiv’s deepening alliance with the West – and demanding guarantees that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO.

Numerous rounds of talks between Russian, European and American officials had failed to end the impasse. US and European officials had argued that NATO is a defensive alliance that does not pose a threat to Russia, stressing that it would be a violation of Kyiv’s sovereignty to allow Moscow to veto its efforts to join.

Before Biden’s announcement, US lawmakers from both major partieshad condemnedthe Russian invasion of Ukraine and called for swift and “painful” sanctions against Moscow.

Asked whether the sanctions failed to stop Putin from invading Ukraine, Biden said on Thursday: “The threat of the sanctions – and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effects of the sanctions – are two different things.”

Biden also said his administration will work to stablise the energy market and minimise the effects of the crisis on fuel costs in the US. Russia is one of the world’s top producers of oil and natural gas.

“I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump,” Biden said. “But this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse.”



The White House later provided further details about the new sanctions on Russia.

Among other things, the measures restrict Sherbank from transactions made in US dollars while also limiting Moscow’s ability to import “sensitive technology, primarily targeting the Russian defense, aviation, and maritime sectors”, the White House said.

Penalties were also announced against 24 individuals and entities, including two state-owned banks, in Belarus, which ishosting Russian troopsparticipating in the invasion.

“That is essentially Joe Biden and the Western alliance sending a message to others: ‘Please do not help Russia with this or else you too will face further sanctions,'” said Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher reporting from Washington.

Fisher said the White House has suggested that more sanctions could be issued if Russia does not end its attack on Ukraine. “It seems that even with the threat of sanctions, Vladimir Putin was willing to push forward. The threat of more sanctions may not be enough to force him to start pulling troops back,” he said.

During his speech, Biden reiterated Washington’s commitment to defend Eastern European NATO countries, three of which share borders with Ukraine. Members of the alliance have a collective defence pact.

The US president said American forces will not fight in Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. He underscored that the US had sent additional troops to Europe over the past weeks, announcing the deployment of forces already on the continent to “NATO’s eastern flank allies, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/biden-unveils-new-russia-sanctions-over-ukraine-invasion,NEGATIVE,0.8132897615432739
Joe biden,Biden struggles to define agenda ahead of visit to Saudi Arabia,"Washington, DC –With thewar in Ukraineleading to a surge in petrol prices in the United States and around the world, oil production will top US President Joe Biden’s agenda when he visits Saudi Arabia later this month.

But Biden and his top aides have shied away from acknowledging the globalenergy crisisis driving the visit. Instead, they have cited an array of issues – from normalising ties with Israel, to ending the war in Yemen, dealing with Iran, addressing climate change and developing “counterterrorism” strategies.

Analysts have said this demonstrates Biden’s reluctance to engage with the Gulf kingdom amidhuman rights concerns, as well as his administration’s efforts to fend off criticism from lawmakers in Washington.

“It could be that the focus on normalisation and trying to stabilise or bring peace to the region is a way to try and shift the narrative over the visit to a more politically friendly terrain for the White House,” said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Middle East fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.

Indeed, while many members of Biden’s Democratic Party are sceptical of deepening ties with Riyadh, there is nearly unanimous consensus in Washington favouringexpanding normalisationbetween Israel and Arab countries.

On several occasions last month, Biden invoked Israel and “peace” in the region when asked about his visit to Saudi Arabia, even before the trip was confirmed.

“It has to do with national security for them – for Israelis,” Biden told reporters of the visit on June 13. “I have a programme, anyway. It has to do with much larger issues than having to do with the energy piece.”

A day later, the White House formally announced that Biden will take a trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia between July 13 and 16. After weeks of speculation, US officialsalso confirmedthat the president would meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom US intelligence reports had accused ofordering the killingof journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Riyadh has insisted that the killing of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 was a rogue operation that took place without the approval or knowledge of top officials, including bin Salman, who is known as MBS.

Still, the death of the Saudi journalist, who was a US resident and worked for the Washington Post at the time of the killing, stirred strong condemnations against the kingdom in Washington, and much of the ire was directed at MBS. At a Democratic Party presidential debate late in 2019, Biden – then a candidate – famously pledged to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” when asked about the murder.

Shibley Telhami, professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland, said there is a political calculation behind Biden’s emphasis onnormalisation betweenIsrael and Arab states in the context of his Middle East trip.

“He thinks the popularity of normalisation with Israel would perhaps offset the negatives of appearing with Mohammed bin Salman,” Telhami told Al Jazeera.

But Telhami added that the US president is “miscalculating” because while normalisation is popular among congressional Democrats, Democratic voters are “leaning more towards the Palestinians now than they are towards the Israelis”.

Meanwhile, the Democratic rank and file opinion of Saudi Arabia remains “negative”, he said.

For his part, Juan Cole, professor of history at the University of Michigan, said promotingnormalisation with Israelin advance of the visit to Saudi Arabia fits with Biden’s support for Israel throughout his career but also happens to be politically beneficial.

“I’m sure that when Biden says it’s partly about making peace for the sake of Israel and so forth these days, on the one hand, he’s playing to the pro-Israel vote in the United States, but on the other hand, I think there’s something to it,” Cole told Al Jazeera.

If the White House’s public focus were solely on oil, it would appear that Biden is “bowing to economic exigencies” and abandoning his “moral stance” on relations with Riyadh, Cole added.

For now, it does not appear that Biden will secure full diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel during his visit. Instead, media reports from the US have predicted incremental normalisation, including reaching an agreement on the transfer of sovereignty on twoRed Sea islandsfrom Egypt to Saudi Arabia, which would require Israeli consent.

Saudi officials have said the kingdom is committed to the2002 Arab Peaceinitiative, which conditions normalisation on establishing a viable Palestinian state.

Ulrichsen said the Saudis may be holding out for the “right time” to normalise ties with Israel.

“It strikes me that the Saudi leadership has made a decision that the US needs them more than they need the US at this moment,” he said.

“Perhaps they’re holding out in a more hardline posture to try and get more concessions out of the administration – whatever they may be in terms of arms salesor Yemenor political rehabilitation of the crown prince.

“And I would include normalisation with Israel in that too, in the sense that the Saudis know they can play that card at a time of their choosing, but they can only play it once.”

Ulrichsen added that Biden is struggling to generate a clear message spelling out the objectives and the reasons for the visit.

“We still don’t see a defined agenda or set of outcomes for what the administration hopes to achieve,” Ulrichsen told Al Jazeera.

And although experts agreed thatoil productionwill be Biden’s dominant priority in Saudi Arabia, White House officials have stressed that the trip will address a “big agenda” when he visits the kingdom, and energy is only one item on it.

“To look at this trip as it being only about oil, it would be simply wrong to do that,” White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters last month.

Ahead of the crucial US midterm legislative elections in November,record petrol pricesfor American consumers are contributing to Biden’s dwindling popularity.

Cole said reducing oil prices is crucial for Biden – domestically and in terms of foreign policy. He explained that while American and Europeansanctions on Russianfuel exports after the invasion of Ukraine have hurt Moscow, the measures made prices spiral, leading to increased revenues for the Russians from more limited sales.

He suggested that if it were not for the oil issue, Biden would not visit the kingdom.

“I’m not sure he could have been convinced to do this merely on those other grounds,” Cole said. “It seems to me that petroleum is in the forefront, not only for Russia policy, but in hopes that extra Saudi production could reduce prices for Americans consumers.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/7/biden-struggles-to-define-agenda-of-contentious-saudi-visit,POSITIVE,0.8083084225654602
Joe biden,US Election 2024,"United States President Joe Biden has made his first public address sincedropping his re-election bid, saying he pulled out of the race against Republican challenger Donald Trump to unite his party and save the country’s democracy.

The 81-year-old politician struck a sombre tone on Wednesday as he sat behind the Resolute Desk at the Oval Office of the White House, and announced that it was “time to pass the torch” to younger voices.

The decision, which Biden first announced on Sunday, followed weeks of pressure from top allies in the Democratic Party after his halting performance against Trump in late June. His withdrawal has upended the already unprecedented race andthrustVice President Kamala Harris into the spotlight as the Democratic party’s heir apparent to take on Trump in November.

Here are the key takeaways from Biden’s 11-minute speech:

Biden did not mention Trump during his address, but it was clear that the Democratic incumbent was referring to the former president when he said the future of the country’s democracy was at stake in the upcoming election.

“I revere this office, but I love my country more,” Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech. “It’s been the honour of my life to serve as your president. But in the defence of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title.”

The US was at an “inflexion point”, he said, adding that the upcoming months will “determine the fate of our nation and the world”.

“We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy? In this moment, we can see those we disagree with, not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Can we do that?” he asked.







Biden said his “record as president, our leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future all merited a second term”, but that he was pulling out of the presidential race to unite his party and win the November election.

“Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,” he said. “The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America – lies in your hands.”

He added that “there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life” but that “there’s also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now”.

“I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,” he said.

Biden took a moment to thank Harris, who he has endorsed to be the Democratic presidential candidate.

“I’ve made my choice,” he said of Harris. “She’s experienced. She’s tough. She’s capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.”

He said it would be up to Americans to make the choice come November.







In an apparent rebut of Republican calls to resign, Biden said he will spend the rest of his term “focused on doing my job as President”.

“That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights – from the right to vote – to the right to choose,” he said, outlining some themes that Harris is expected to build her campaign around.

He added that he would continue to work for Supreme Court reform and rally support for Ukraine and end Israel’s war on Gaza.

“I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,” he said.

Biden wrapped up his address by describing his time as president “privilege of my life”.

“Nowhere on earth could a kid with a stutter from the modest beginnings of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,” he said.

Joe biden,"Timeline: The Biden administration on Gaza, in its own words","Washington, DC –As Israel’s war in Gaza prompts mounting human rights concerns, the United States has slowly notched up criticism of the Israeli government while simultaneously continuing to arm and support its ally.

On Sunday, US Vice President Kamala Harris delivered the sternest statement yet on the war’s toll, marking a shift in rhetoric within the administration of President Joe Biden. An estimated 30,800 Palestinians have been killed, with more at risk of malnutrition and starvation.

“People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane, and our common humanity compels us to act,”Harris said. “The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid — no excuses.”

However, critics were quick to point out that the Biden administration is pushing forward with its military and diplomatic support for Israel, despite acknowledging the crisis.

Thursday marks five months since the Palestinian group Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel, starting the present-day war. Israel has led a deadly bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, in addition to a siege that limits Gaza’s access to key resources like food and water.

As the conflict enters its sixth month, Al Jazeera looks at key statements from the Biden administration on the war and how Washington’s position evolved over time.

October 7, 2023:Shortly after Hamas’s attack on Israel, Biden delivers a message of uncompromising support to the US ally while also warning other parties against entering the war. About 1,100 Israelis were killed in the attack, with more than 200 others taken captive.

“My administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering,” Biden says.







October 10, 2023:Biden sets the stage for a forceful Israeli response after speaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“I just got off the phone — the third call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I told him if the United States experienced what Israel is experiencing, our response would be swift, decisive and overwhelming,” he says.

October 12, 2023:Secretary of State Antony Blinken travels to Israel to voice support for the country.

“If you’ll permit me a personal aside, I come before you not only as the United States secretary of state but also as a Jew,” he tells Netanyahu.

October 16, 2023:Bidenwarns Israelagainst establishing a permanent military presence in Gaza.

“I think it’d be a big mistake,” he tells CBS News.

October 18, 2023:After the US sendsaircraft carriersto the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Biden again warns parties in the region to not enter the war.

Joe biden,"Biden rebukes Israel, says he’s ‘outraged’ over killing of Gaza aid workers","United States President Joe Biden has said he is “outraged and heartbroken” by Israel’s killing of seven aid workers in Gaza, delivering some of his strongest criticism yet of the close US ally.

Biden’s rebuke is the latest example of his conflicting messages on the war, as his administration becomes increasingly critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government even while doubling down on the need to supply Israel with weaponry.

In a statement issued by the White House on Tuesday night, Biden squarely accused Israel of not doing enough to protect innocent civilians in its war against Hamas.

“This conflict has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed. This is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult – because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians,” Biden said, describing the deceased aid workers as “brave and selfless”.

“Incidents like yesterday’s simply should not happen. Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians. The US has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties.”

Biden said an investigation that Israel has promised to carry out into the incident “must be swift, it must bring accountability, and its findings must be made public”.

“The United States will continue to do all we can to deliver humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, through all available means,” he said.

“I will continue to press Israel to do more to facilitate that aid. And we are pushing hard for an immediate ceasefire as part of a hostage deal. I have a team in Cairo working on this right now.”

I am outraged and heartbroken by the deaths of seven humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen, including one American, in Gaza yesterday.

Incidents like yesterday’s simply should not happen.

Here is my full statement.pic.twitter.com/Nl2jq8wqTt

— President Biden (@POTUS)April 3, 2024



The seven workers for the US-based aid organisation World Central Kitchen were killed on Monday night when the convoy they were travelling in was attacked after unloading food aid in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah city.

A US-Canadian dual citizen, an Australian, a Pole, a Palestinian and three nationals of the United Kingdom were killed in the attack.

Netanyahu earlier on Tuesday acknowledged Israel’s responsibility for the attack, describing it as unintended and “tragic”.

“Unfortunately, in the past day, there was a tragic event in which our forces unintentionally harmed non-combatants in the Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu said in a video statement on Tuesday.

“This happens in war. We are conducting a thorough inquiry and are in contact with the governments. We will do everything to prevent a recurrence.”

Despite his insistence that Israel must protect civilians, Biden has continued to press for more weapons deliveries to Israel, including $18bn worth of F-15 fighter jets.

Since Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel, Biden has greenlit two emergency shipments of weapons to Israel worth more than $250m on top of a regular military aid allotment worth $3.8bn annually.

Biden’s handling of the war has generated increasing blowback from progressives, rights activists, Arab Americans and Muslims, raising fears for his bid for re-election in November within Democratic Party circles.

Biden: “Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians.” Nor has Israel done enough to avoid killing and starving Palestinian civilians. But Biden keeps arming and funding Israel anyway.#EmptyWordshttps://t.co/vBw2vKLIKY

Joe biden,"US President Joe Biden is healthy, ‘fit for duty’, says doctor","Joe Biden, 80, remains healthy and “fit for duty”, the White House physician has said after the physical examination of the US president whose health has been in focus amid his expected run for a second term.

“The president remains fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,” White House physician Kevin O’Connor said on Thursday in a summary of the health exam.

The exam was closely watched as Biden prepares for his expected run for a second term in 2024. The summary said Biden did not have any “longCOVID” symptoms and that his stiff gait has not worsened since his last exam in November 2021.

Biden said his physical went well. “Everything really went well … Thank God, for small favours,” he told NBC News.

Biden’s three-hour session with doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, was his second extensive exam since taking office in January 2021.

President Biden underwent a routine physical today. A full update from Dr. Kevin O’Connor, Physician to the President is available here:

https://t.co/isfEYVJWdG

— The White House (@WhiteHouse)February 17, 2023



Biden takes the statin Crestor to keep his cholesterol levels low, an anti-coagulant in response to atrial fibrillation that remains asymptomatic and medication to treat seasonal allergies and acid reflux, the summary said.

Several small skin growths were moved from his face and head using liquid nitrogen and “one small lesion on the president’s chest was excised today and sent for traditional biopsy”, O’Connor said. Results are pending.

The summary found that Biden’s weight had dropped from 83.5kg (184 pounds) in 2021 to 81kg (178 pounds). His body mass index was at 24.1 compared with 25.0 in 2021, and his blood pressure was at 126/78 compared with 120/70 in 2021.

The summary made no mention of whether Biden underwent any cognitive tests sometimes given to people of his age.

O’Connor said Biden’s back stiffness is a result of significant spinal arthritis.

“The president’s gait remains stiff, but has not worsened since last year,” he said.

Biden, the oldest person ever to serve as US president, has dismissed questions about his age, but polls indicate voters have concerns about his ability to serve four more years if he wins in 2024.

Asked about the concerns over Biden’s age, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters: “This is a president that works day in and day out, you know, in a gruelling fashion with a gruelling schedule, and delivers.”

About three-quarters of Americans – including more than half of Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans – say Biden is too old to work in government, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from February 6 to 13.

Most Democratic respondents said the president remains mentally sharp, but about half of them said he cannot handle the physical toll of the presidency.

Biden does not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco, and works out five times a week, the physical noted.

Biden would be 86 by the end of a prospective second term, making him 13 years older than the average life expectancy of an American male, according to 2020 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.

Biden said during a PBS interview last week that any Americans concerned about his age should “watch me” perform the duties of the presidency.

Joe biden,About half US Democrats want Joe Biden to run again: Poll,"AsJoe Bidenprepares to launch a re-election bid, a new poll shows that about half of Democrats want him to run again, but more than 80 percent said they would still back the US president against a Republican rival in the general elections in 2024.

The poll released on Friday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed that 26 percent of Americans overall – including 47 percent of Democrats – want tosee Bidenseek a second term.

Biden’s candidacy appears to be gaining support among Democrats. A January poll showed 37 percent of Democratic respondents said they would like him to run.

A total of 81 percent of Democrats say they would at least probably support Biden in a general election if he is the nominee. The poll included 1,230 respondents.

Biden hasindicated explicitlythat he intends to pursue the presidency again, but he has not made a formal announcement. Several US media outlets have reported that the president will launch his campaign early next week, perhaps on Tuesday – four years to the day after he announced his 2020 campaign.







In Friday’s poll, 78 percent of Democratic respondents said they approve of the job Biden is doing as president. But his age seems to be the main concern about his candidacy.

At 80, Biden is already the oldest president in US history. If re-elected, he would be 82 at the time of his second inauguration and 86 by the end of that term.

Jenipher Lagana, 59, told the AP she likesBidenand described him as an “interesting man” who has had an “incredible political career”.

But “my problem with him running in 2024 is that he’s just so old”, said Lagana, who is retired and lives in California.

Sitting presidents eligible for re-election rarely face serious primary challenges from within their party. Biden would be a clear favourite to win the Democratic nomination if he runs again.

So far, two other Democrats have announced 2024 presidential campaigns, but their bids are largely seen as long-shot efforts.

Marianne Williamson, a self-help author and 2020 candidate, announced a primary challenge against Biden earlier this year, promising more progressive policies.

Robert F Kennedy Jr, a descendant of one of the most powerful Democratic families who is known as a vaccine sceptic, also launched a presidential campaign this month, promising to push back against what he called the “corrupt merger between state and corporate power”.

Kennedy is the nephew of slain US President John F Kennedy and the son ofRobert Kennedy, who served as attorney general and was assassinated as he was running for president in 1968.

On the Republican side, former President Donald Trump appears to be the frontrunner for the 2024 nomination despite hislegal troubles.







The former president is facingcriminal chargesin New York as well as various investigations, including into his push to overturn the results of the 2020 elections.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has yet to announce his bid, is widely considered Trump’s most serious rival for the Republican nomination. DeSantis has been rising to prominence in conservative circles as he championedright-wing causeson social issues in Florida as governor.

Nikki Haley, a former US envoy to the United Nations,is also seekingthe Republican nomination.

Joe biden,US President Joe Biden pardons son Hunter despite pledge not to,"United States President Joe Bidenhas pardonedhis son Hunter for his firearms and tax convictions despite previously pledging not to use his presidential authority to grant him clemency.

Biden said on Sunday that his son had been “singled out” and “selectively, and unfairly” prosecuted due to his family name.

“There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House.

“In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.”

Explaining his decision, Biden said that throughout his career he had followed the principle of telling the public the truth out of a belief that Americans are fair-minded.

“Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said.

“I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.”

Biden’s announcement comes weeks beforeHunter Bidenwas set to face sentencing for a string of felonies related to making a false statement about his drug use during a gun background check and failing to pay at least $1.4m in taxes.

The outgoing president’s decision is likely to stoke debate about the independence of the US justice system, which is already in the spotlight amid warnings by critics that President-elect Donald Trump intends to use law enforcement agencies stacked with loyalists to target his political rivals.

Trump, who faced astring of criminal casesbefore his re-election all but assured that he will not suffer serious legal consequences, blasted the pardon as an abuse of power.

“Does the pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social, referring to people convicted of crimes related to theJanuary 6, 2021 riotat the US Capitol.

“Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!”

The younger Biden had faced a maximum of 25 years in prison in the tax case and 17 years in the firearms case, though he would have almost certainly received much less severe punishment under federal sentencing guidelines.

Special counsel David Weiss, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to probe allegations against Hunter Biden, brought the charges after an earlier plea deal collapsed under scrutiny from a judge.

In justifying the pardon, Biden said that people are “almost never” brought to trial for wrongly filling out a gun purchase form and that those who pay their taxes late usually receive “non-criminal resolutions”.

The president said that Republicans, who cited Hunter Biden’s overseas business activities in a since-abandoned impeachment effort, had used his son’s troubles to damage him and oppose his election.

“Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room – with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process,” Biden said.

“Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases.”

Biden’s pardon covers not only his son’s tax and firearms convictions but also any other offences he has “committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024”.

In June, Biden had flatly ruled out the possibility of granting his son a pardon or commuting his sentence.

“I said I will abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him,” Biden had said.

The White House had reiterated Biden’s intention not to pardon his son as recently as November 8, when press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters: “Our answer stands, which is no.”

In a statement on Sunday, Hunter Biden said that mistakes he had made in the throes of addiction had been “exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport”.

“In recovery we can be given the opportunity to make amends where possible and rebuild our lives if we never take for granted the mercy that we have been afforded,” he said.

“I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.”

Under the US Constitution, presidents have almost unlimited power to grant clemency to people convicted of federal crimes.

US presidents have used pardons to benefit family members and political allies in the past.

Shortly before the end of his first term,Trump pardonedCharles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, after he did jail time for convictions for tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness tampering.

Joe biden,Seven women on Joe Biden’s shortlist of potential vice presidents,"With the November 3 general election in the United States less than 100 days away, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is under increasing pressure to select a running mate for his challenge to incumbent President Donald Trump. In his most recent comments on the topic, he pledged to name his choice at some point in “early August”.

During the final debate just before the coronavirus took over the headlines and airwaves, Biden committed to choosing a woman and he has held fast to that promise since. Consequently, the list of Biden’s potential running mates is exclusively women.









Biden was already under pressure from Democrats to have a woman of colour on the ticket because of the outsized role that Black voters played in his road to the nomination during the primaries. The recent reckoning over racism and inequality – roiling the nation following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis – has only added to that pressure.

Selecting a running mate is a critical decision for any presidential candidate, but it is an especially critical calculation for the 77-year-old Biden, who if elected would become the oldest American president in history. The decision carries additional weight amid the coronavirus pandemic, which, beyond its high human toll, has devastated the US economy to an extent that will be felt well into the first term of the next president and beyond.

Below are five of the women Biden is widely reported to be considering.

A Senator from California, Harris is a former rival who endorsed Biden and began campaigning for him after she ended her bid in December. She has been at the centre of vice-presidential speculation since. Harris, 55, was elected California attorney general in 2010 and has been a rising star in the Democratic Party. A daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, she could help rally Black voters, a crucial Democratic voting bloc, behind Biden.

Warren, 70, who also vied for her party’s nomination during the primaries, is a Massachusetts Senator and an academic who specialised in bankruptcy and commercial law. Her policy proposals are much more progressive than Biden’s. Picking her as his running mate might help sway some of the more liberal voters in the Democratic party in his favour.

The African American congresswoman from Florida rose to national prominence after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi chose her as one of seven Democrats to serve as a manager in the impeachment proceedings against Trump. Before coming to Congress, she worked her way up through the ranks of the Orlando, Florida police department to become its first female chief. Demings, 63, was first elected to office in 2016. The fact that she hails from a state deemed critical in November helps, but her background in law enforcement may not please some who have been critical of Biden’s track record on criminal justice.

The New Mexico governor is another unknown nationally but hails from a family prominent in New Mexico politics. Luhan Grisham, 60, served three terms in the House before being elected governor in 2018 and is also one of the highest-ranking Latina elected officials in the US. In the past, she has been a strong supporter of abortion rights, committed her state to push for lower greenhouse gas emissions, and, as a congresswoman, called for a higher minimum wage and restrictions on the sale of semi-automatic rifles.

Susan Rice worked closely with Biden during his time as vice president, and has emerged as a favourite among some former Obama administration officials and is personally close to the former president. She has never held elected office but has extensive foreign policy experience, including as US ambassador to the United Nations. She’s also been an outspoken critic of the administration of Trump since leaving the White House and considered running for the US Senate in Maine.

Rice has long been a target of Republicans, including for statements she made blaming the deadly 2012 attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya on protests spawned by an internet video. Republicans have also accused her of spying on Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, though records declassified by the Trump administration show no evidence of Rice improperly accessing any information.

A late addition to Biden’s shortlist, Bass, a congresswoman from Southern California and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, would add a progressive voice to the ticket.

Bass has an extensive background in police reform efforts and has spearheaded the legislative response in the House to the killing of George Floyd. But at 66, she may not offer the prospect of generational transition that Biden wants to show.

Duckworth, 52, has a compelling personal story and would help bolster the campaign’s national security credentials.

The senator from Illinois is a combat veteran who lost her legs when her helicopter was shot down in Iraq in 2004. She went on to become the first woman with a disability and the first Thai-American elected to US Congress. Duckworth, however, has not been on the forefront of civil justice issues like Harris, Bass and others on Biden’s list.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/7/28/seven-women-on-joe-bidens-shortlist-of-potential-vice-presidents,POSITIVE,0.9452691674232483
Joe biden,Joe Biden beats Donald Trump to win White House,"Democrat Joe Biden said he is “honored and humbled” by the projected results of the United States presidential election, which showed him above the threshold needed to clinch the White House.

The Associated Press (AP) on Saturday projected that Biden had 290 Electoral College votes, after the news agency calledPennsylvaniaand then Nevada in his favour.

“I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect [Kamala] Harris,” Biden, 77, said in a statement a few minutes after the projection was announced.

Harris will now be the first woman, first African American and first person of Asian descent to serve as vice president.

The projected Biden-Harris victory comes after several anxiety-inducing days in which people around the world watched as battleground US states counted ballots and leads shifted between Biden and Republican incumbent President Donald Trump.

The process facedlonger-than-usual delaysin part because millions of Americans cast mail-in ballots this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trump, who has tried to discredit and cast doubt on the US electoral process, hasvowed to challengethe projected results. His campaign has filed lawsuits in several states to challenge the ballot counts, and signalled plans to demand a recount in at least one key state, Wisconsin.

Ina statementon Saturday, Trump said the “election is far from over” and accused Biden of “rushing to falsely pose as the winner”.

“Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,” he said.

Ballot counting continues in several key battleground states where the margins are razor-thin.

In US elections, it is common practice for news organisations, after determining that a candidate no longer has a path to victory, to project a winner in the race.

“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,” Trump’s statement read.

“The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots.”

Biden, for his part, called for unity on Saturday after what was an extremely divisive election campaign.

“With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,” he said.

The Democratic president-elect is expected to address the nation at 8pm ET (0100GMT) Saturday.

Meanwhile, crowds of Biden supporters have gathered in Washington, DC, New York, and elsewhere across the US, to celebrate the candidate’s projected victory.

Joe biden,‘No surprise’: US students slam Biden’s comments on Gaza encampments,"President Joe Biden says “order must prevail” on university campuses in the United States, just hours after police raided and dismantled anotherprotest encampmentin support of Palestinians.

In a brief news conference on Thursday, Biden said both the right to free speech and the rule of law “must be upheld” but stressed that “violent protest is not protected”.

“Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation — none of this is a peaceful protest. Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not a peaceful protest,” he said.

“Dissent is essential to democracy, but dissent must never lead to disorder or to denying the rights of others so students can finish the semester and their college education,” Biden continued. “There’s a right to protest but not the right to cause chaos.”

Biden’s comments came shortly after policearrested at least 132 student protestersat the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), early on Thursday and cleared out an encampment.

UCLA is among thedozens of US universitieswhere students have set up camps over the past few weeks to demand an end to Israel’s war in Gaza. Many are also calling for their schools to divest from any firms complicit in Israeli abuses.

The protests have been met with a fierce backlash from university administrators, as well as pro-Israel lawmakers and groups.

On Thursday, students and other observers quickly slammed Biden’s statement as failing to recognise that US colleges and universities have called heavily armed police forces onto their campuses to disperse non-violent demonstrations.

The recent arrests of students and faculty at UCLA and New York’sColumbia University, among other campuses, have drawn widespread condemnation.

But in his brief address, Biden did not comment on university policies or the use of force by police. Nor did he remark on reports that pro-Israel demonstrators hadattacked pro-Palestinian demonstratorsat the UCLA encampment this week.

Instead, he said there is no place on college campuses for “anti-Semitism or threats of violence against Jewish students”. Student demonstrators, however, have rejected accusations that their encampments are anti-Semitic or pose a threat.

“There’s a [sense of] disappointment, but there’s no surprise,” Kali, a student protester at George Washington University in Washington, DC, said of Biden’s remarks.

“For the Biden administration to demonise us in this way is honestly incredibly disappointing,” Kali told Al Jazeera. “It paints a target on the backs of Arab, Muslim, Palestinian, anti-Zionist youth.”







Biden has faced months of widespread anger and mass protests over hisunwavering supportfor Israel during the Gaza war.

More than 34,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since early October. The besieged enclave faces a dire humanitarian crisis, and the top United Nations court said the war has spurred aplausible risk of genocide.

The US president, who is seeking re-election in November, also faces growing disapproval among young voters.

Biden’s approval rating stands at 28 percent among voters under age 30, according to a Pew Research Center survey released last week.

A recent CNN poll also showed that a staggering 81 percent of voters younger than 35 disapprove of Biden’s handling of Israel’s war on Gaza.

The Democratic president’ssupport for Israel, condemnation of the student protests, and silence on the mass arrests and violence against demonstrators may fuel young people’s apathy — if not antipathy — towards him, experts said.

“The Democrats can’t really afford to give people more reasons to vote against Biden, and this actually becomes one,” Omar Wasow, assistant professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, told Al Jazeera.







Experts say young voters could be key to Biden’s prospects in November, as he faces a likely rematch against his 2020 rival, Republican Donald Trump.

In a close race, as the November election is expected to be, low turnout could spell trouble for the Democratic incumbent.

Hasan Pyarali — the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party — told Al Jazeera he was disappointed by Biden’s comments on Thursday.

“In our point of view, it’s not just good policy tooppose the genocide; it’s good politics. He has done neither, and we’re really disappointed to see that,” said Pyarali, a senior at Wake Forest University in North Carolina.

He added that it was especially disheartening to hear Biden say he would not reconsider his Middle East policy as a result of the student protests.

“We’re here to make it known that if he doesn’t change course, there’s a real risk that we [Democrats] lose 2024,” Pyarali said.

He also said the prospect of Trump winning in November would not be enough to convince young voters to vote for Biden. “It’s not on us to make sure that Trump doesn’t come back; it’s on Biden and his campaign,” he said.

“It’s now on him to go forward. If he wants to continue down the path that is unpopular, unjust and genocidal, he certainly can — he’s the president of the United States. But it’s at the peril of essentially losing an entire generation of voters and also risking the 2024 election.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/2/no-surprise-us-students-slam-bidens-comments-on-gaza-encampments,NEGATIVE,0.9947946667671204
Joe biden,How Joe Biden got to 270 votes in the US Electoral College,"United States presidential candidate Joe Biden’s projected win in Pennsylvania has put him over the top in the Electoral College, the threshold needed to win the White House, according to the Associated Press news agency.

The AP said on Saturday that Biden was projected to win the key battleground state – giving him 284 Electoral College votes. The AP soon after called a win for Biden in Nevada, putting him at 290.









Under theElectoral College system, which is defined in the US Constitution, 50 US states and the District of Columbia are apportioned electors based on their population.

A presidential candidate needs to win 270 electoral votes out of 538 to win the presidency, notwithstanding the popular vote.

President Donald Trump has not conceded and in a statement issued after the announcement said “this election is far from over”. His campaign has promised to challenge the results in various states.

“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,” Trump said in the Saturday statement.

The pathways to 270 Electoral College votes described below are all projections released by The Associated Press, and they will need to be certified by state officials in the coming days and weeks.

Recounts are all but certain in several key states, including Georgia and Wisconsin, and Trump has said he will try to challenge the results in court.

Here is a look at how both Biden and Trump got their Electoral College votes.

Biden started with a baseline of 187 Electoral College votes from the District of Columbia and 14 solidly Democratic states, including two of the country’s largest: California, which is worth a whopping 55 Electoral College votes, and New York, which holds 29.

Biden easily picked up Colorado, Virginia and New Hampshire on election night, which added 26 votes to his column to bring him to 213.

As votes were tabulated and reported the next day, Biden then began beating Trump in key battleground states.

He secured Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, adding 36 votes to bring his total to 249.

He also won parts of Nebraska and Maine, which have a split Electoral College system, giving him an additional four electoral votes between them – bringing his total to 253.

Crucially, Biden won the state of Arizona, which had gone to Trump in 2016, bringing him 11 votes and putting him within striking distance of victory, at 264 total votes.

Biden’smargin in Arizona was tightand while the Associated Press and Fox News had called it for the former US vice president, other major media organisations held off as incoming mail ballots appeared to favour Trump.

That is when the process appeared to stall on Thursday, as the count of millions of mail ballots inall-important Pennsylvaniaand Georgia ground on with the presidency hanging in the balance and no clear winner.

Then, on Saturday, Biden’s win in Pennsylvania put him over the top in the Electoral College with 284 votes. The AP soon after called a win for Biden in Nevada, putting him at 290.

The Republican leader started with only 122 votes from 19 solidly Republican states.

Texas had briefly appeared close, but Trump won its 38 electoral votes to bring his early count to 160.

Trump won some, but not all of the battleground states he had won in the 2016 elections.

Ohio, Iowa, and Florida went to the president, adding 53 votes and getting him to 213 in the Electoral College.

He also won a congressional district in Maine, bringing him an additional vote – and bumping his total up to 214.

But Trump fell short in the all-important Midwest, losing Michigan and Wisconsin to Biden.

In the end, Trump needed Pennsylvania just to stay in the race.

Even then he would have still needed a long-shot win in Nevada and a reversal of the outcome in Arizona, two southwest states that went to Biden.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/7/how-joe-biden-got-to-270-votes-in-the-us-electoral-college,NEGATIVE,0.5479567646980286
Joe biden,"Biden says Gaza ceasefire in sight, warns against efforts to undermine deal","United States President Joe Biden has said that a Gaza ceasefire deal is now in sight and warned parties in the Middle East to not undermine the ongoing negotiations to reach an agreement that would see the release of captives held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails.

Biden told reporters on Friday that a deal was “much, much closer” than before the talks began, but he also cautioned that “we’re not there yet”.

“There’s a couple more issues. I think we’ve got a shot,” he said.

Previous efforts by theBiden administrationto bring about a ceasefire in Gaza have failed and criticism of the president has surged as Washington appears unwilling to use leverage with its key ally Israel.

In a separate statement, Biden announced that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be travelling to the Middle East starting on Saturday to continue the diplomatic push.

Biden also said that he spoke with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who he said expressed strong support for the US efforts.

In the Qatari capital, Doha, where Qatari, Egyptian and US negotiation mediators are trying to hammer out a deal on Gaza, ceasefire talks were paused on Friday, but are expected to resume next week with the hope of concluding an agreement in Cairo.

“The path is now set for that outcome, saving lives, bringing relief to the people of Gaza, and de-escalating regional tensions,” Qatar, Egypt and the US said in a joint statement on Friday.







A senior US official has described the latest diplomatic efforts to end the 10-month violence as the most productive in months.

Speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, the official said that there is a “consensus” by all of the participants over the past 48 hours “that there’s really a new spirit here to drive it to a conclusion”.

“We made a lot of progress in the number of issues that we’ve been working on,” the official said.

Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said that there is “a sense of optimism” about the talks, adding that negotiators have been able to “bridge the gap” on the swap of Hamas captives and Palestinian detainees in Israel. Other difficulties include questions over who controls the Gaza-Egypt border after the war and the free movement for Palestinians inside Gaza, he said.

On Thursday, an Israeli delegation and mediators began the latest round in months of talks to end the war in Gaza, which haskilled at least 40,000 Palestinians. The Palestinian group Hamas was not directly involved in the talks but was kept briefed on their progress.

The Israeli delegation included Mossad spy chief David Barnea, the head of the Shin Bet domestic security service, Ronen Bar, and the military’s chief hostage negotiator, Nitzan Alon, officials said.

The White House sent CIA Director Bill Burns and US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and Egypt’s intelligence chief Abbas Kamel were also taking part.

Washington hopes a ceasefire agreement in Gaza can defuse the risk of a wider war amid Iran’s warning that it will retaliate against Israel after the assassination ofHamas leader Ismail Haniyehin Tehran on July 31.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/17/biden-says-gaza-ceasefire-in-sight-warns-against-efforts-to-undermine-deal,NEGATIVE,0.7173402309417725
Joe biden,‘Relationship reassessed’: Joe Biden and Saudi Arabia relations,"US President-elect Joe Biden has made his position on Saudi Arabia and its war in Yemen clear.

In the past two years, Biden has said Saudi Arabia’s government has “very little social redeeming value”, that Riyadh had murdered “children … and innocent people” in Yemen, and it was a “pariah” state.

“Under a Biden-Harris administration, we will reassess our relationship with the Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia], end US support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, and make sure America does not check its values at the door to sell arms or buy oil,” Biden said in October.

That forceful language is echoed by the wider Democratic Party. Just in the past week, US Representative Ro Khanna tweeted the Democrats would “stop funding the Saudi war in Yemen”.

The reason for this push to punish Saudi Arabia on the Democratic side is clear – the war in Yemen’s continuing humanitarian cost, the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, and the Trump administration’s overt support for Saudi Arabia throughout these affairs.

Aside from shared antipathy for Iran, Saudi Arabia was President Donald Trump’s first overseas visit, and the outgoing US leader bragged that he protected Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) after Khashoggi’s killing. Many Democrats, on the other hand, called for MBS to be held accountable.







However, there is often a difference between promises made on the campaign trail and the reality of life as the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth – one that has historically always sought to remain friendly with Saudi Arabia.

Analysts say it is, therefore, more likely Biden will adopt a balanced approach that, while different to Trump’s, is not quite the repudiation of Saudi Arabia that some in the Democrat base might want.

“The Biden administration will end the perception that the Saudi leadership enjoys near-unconditional support in the White House … with a view to reframing it around goals that serve both the US and Saudi interests,” Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University, told Al Jazeera.

“These would include a way of disengaging Saudi Arabia from Yemen.”

Ulrichsen said this new policy towards Saudi Arabia would extend to arms sales, as Washington seeks to attempt to not lose Saudi business while pivoting to arms sales of a different nature.

“Given that advisers around Biden have maintained a commitment to helping defend Saudi Arabia against regional adversaries, I’d imagine there would be more of a focus on ensuring that any weapons sales would be defensive rather than offensive in nature,” Ulrichsen said.

A quarter of US weapons sales in the five years between 2014 and 2019 went to Saudi Arabia, up from 7.4 percent in 2010-2014, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Saudi Arabia began its military involvement in the war in Yemen in March 2015.







In addition to billions of dollars in arms sales, the US provides logistical and intelligence support to the Saudi war effort in Yemen, and previously refuelled Saudi planes in-flight.

In April 2019, a bipartisan resolution to end American involvement in the war was passed by both houses of Congress, only to be vetoed by Trump. At the time, the president defended his actions by saying peace in Yemen could only come through “a negotiated settlement”. The question now is whether Biden will have more luck in bringing about such a solution.

“I think the Biden administration can have a very positive impact on ending the war in Yemen,” said Gregory Johnsen, a former member of the UN Security Council Panel of Experts on Yemen. “Indeed, the US may be the only country, which – if it so chooses – can put enough diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia to end the war in Yemen.”

However, ending Saudi involvement in Yemen does not necessarily mean the wider conflict in the country will be over.

“Ending the Saudi-led war in Yemen is step one, but the next and much more difficult step is ending Yemen’s civil war and putting the country back together again,” Johnsen said.

Aside from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the war in Yemen involves a myriad number of warring parties, including the internationally-recognised government, the Iran-allied Houthi rebels, and the separatist Southern Transitional Council.

Fighting in the country has intensified over the past few months with the Houthis advancing into Marib, the Yemeni government’s power-base in the north of the country, and home to a large population of internally displaced people.

If the Biden administration is successful in a push for peace talks, it may come as the Houthis hold the upper hand on the battlefield. And that does not necessarily mean the outcome of any negotiated agreement will lead to an end to the war on the ground.

“We should not overestimate what the Biden administration can do in relation to Yemen’s war,” Nadwa Dawsari, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera. “A political settlement under the current circumstances would further complicate Yemen’s war and play into the hands of the Houthis and, by default, Iran.”

“Trump gave the Saudis and the Emiratis a free hand in Yemen,” Dawsari added. “I hope Biden won’t do the opposite and give Iran a free hand in Yemen.”

Joe biden,"Profile: President-Elect Joe Biden, a life in service","Pennsylvania-born Joseph Robinette Biden has spent most of his adult life in elected office.

At the age of 29, he won a seat representing the state of Delaware in the US Senate as one of the youngest ever elected to the chamber.

Before that, Biden had worked as a lawyer and served for two years on a county council in Delaware, where his Irish-Catholic family had relocated when he was a child.

The son of a car salesman, Biden’s career in the chamber earned him a reputation as a straight-talking moderate, willing to work with the opposing party to get legislation passed.

However, with a three-decade-long congressional career, and a Democratic Party that has moved farther left in recent years, Biden’s record in the chamber has come under increased scrutiny.

Critics have denounced his drafting of a 1994 crime bill that has been blamed for causing the mass imprisonment of minorities and his eulogising of Senate colleague Strom Thurmond, a man who began his political career as a segregationist.

He has also faced criticism for his role as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the controversial grilling of Anita Hill during the Supreme Court confirmation hearing of Clarence Thomas in 1991. Hill had accused Thomas of sexual harassment.









Biden’s 2020 bid for the presidency is his third. Campaigns in 1988 and 2008 both fizzled. The first ended amid allegations of plagiarism. The second resulted in then-candidate Barack Obama choosing the elder politician as his running mate.

Biden, now 77, served as vice president during Obama’s two terms from 2008 to 2016.

The pair developed a close relationship from what had initially been a more strategic pairing, with Biden credited for using his working-class roots, folksy flourishes and experience to help shore up support for the country’s first Black president from older white Americans in key northern swing states.









Obama endorsed Biden in April 2020, saying his former running mate embodied “the spirit of looking out for one another”.

On the campaign trail, the former vice president has been known to espouse “Bidenism” – pithy wisdoms often attributed to family.

“My dad had an expression,” he said at the beginning of his 2020 campaign. “He said, ‘Joey, a job is about a lot more than a pay cheque. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect.'”

The off-the-cuff style, however, has also left Biden prone to gaffes, including proclaiming during a 2020 radio interview “You ain’t Black” if you support Trump.

Biden has also shown a talent for giving a personal touch to his public persona, speaking about his severe stutter as a child that earned him the nickname “Dash”.

He has also been open about the family tragedies that have marked his time in office.

Biden’s first wife, Neilia Hunter, and infant daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash while out Christmas shopping in 1972 – just weeks after Biden had first won election to the Senate.

Biden’s sons Beau, 4, and Hunter, 2, were badly injured in the wreck and Biden was famously sworn into the Senate beside his sons’ hospital beds. He later went on to marry Jill Biden and have another daughter, Ashley.

In 2015, during Biden’s second term as vice president, Beau, who had followed him into politics and served as the Attorney General of Delaware, died from a brain tumour at age 46. Biden briefly swore off running for office after the death.









Meanwhile, Biden’s younger son Hunter’s career as a lawyer and lobbyist, including a five-year term on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, has been the target ofunsupported corruption allegations.

An alleged attempt by Trump allies, and the president himself, to dig up dirt on the younger Biden was central to impeachment proceedings against the president beginning in 2019.

Biden’s popularity has grown steadily throughout the election season after initially facing a formidable challenge from progressive Senator Bernie Sanders. The early primary upsets led the Biden campaign to rework some policies ahead of the general election, in an attempt to appeal to the growing progressive base.

The former vice president has also done little to distance himself from his voter-energising former boss, largely embracing the suggestion that his presidency will be an Obama redux.

Along with running mateKamala Harris, Biden continues to pitch himself as a reassuring and experienced force who can unify the country following four years of Trump. If he wins the election, he would also be the oldest person to assume the presidency in US history, turning 78 by the time he would take office.

In accepting the party’s nomination during the Democratic National Convention in August, Biden envisioned his presidency as “the end of this chapter of American darkness”.

The election, he said, is nothing short of a “battle for the country’s soul”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/29/us-elections-who-is-democratic-presidential-candidate-joe-biden,POSITIVE,0.9980593323707581
Joe biden,Biden’s team is planning a Cuba reset: Sources,"President-elect Joe Biden’s team plans to bring the U.S. closer to normalized relations with Cuba, reversing many of the sanctions and regulations imposed during the Trump administration, according to people familiar with the matter.

That strategy includes reducing restrictions on travel, investment and remittances for the island nation that are perceived to disproportionately hurt Americans and ordinary Cubans, said the people, who requested anonymity because the new administration is still coming together. Other measures that target Cuba for human rights abuses would remain in place, the people said.

The prospect of a détente between Washington and Havana rekindles memories of the thaw that Biden helped champion during the Obama administration, when the two nations restored diplomatic ties that had been broken for decades following Fidel Castro’s rise to power.

But the president-elect is returning to an even messier scene: the Cuban economy is suffering its worst crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union amid fallout from Covid-19 and U.S. sanctions. At the same time, Cuban intelligence officers have helped prop up Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, allowing his regime to consolidate its grip on power in defiance of demands for free and fair elections.

With a packed domestic agenda, it’s unclear how quickly Biden will move on implementing his Cuba policy. Even if some changes happen early, the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown could delay the benefits of any measures that allow for greater travel to the island. It’s also unclear whether Biden will increase staffing at the U.S. embassy in Havana. The Trump administration pared back diplomatic operations after strange illnesses, including brain trauma, afflicted some U.S. diplomats and their families.

Biden said in October that the U.S. needed a new Cuba policy, though his team has been firm in condemning efforts by Havana to silence dissidents, including a recent raid on a house full of activists and artists.

The president-elect has also denounced Venezuela’s Maduro as a dictator. Just as the Trump administration connected Cuba and Venezuela policy, using sanctions as a tool intended to spur political change, Biden’s team may try to leverage a rapprochement in exchange for the Cubans reducing their presence in Venezuela and supporting a diplomatic resolution to the crisis there, according to the people.

We support the Cuban people in their struggle for liberty and echo calls for the Cuban government to release peaceful protestors. The Cuban people must be allowed to exercise the universal right to freedom of expression.

— Jake Sullivan (@jakejsullivan)November 29, 2020



Another complicating factor is Florida. While Biden’s advisers have criticized Trump’s Latin American policies for being heavily influenced by electoral politics, particularly the goal of winning the Sunshine State, they still face a sobering reality: The Democratic Party must defend a narrow House majority in 2022. Any policies that are perceived as easing pressure on Cuba and Venezuela without getting significant concessions from their left-wing governments could risk backlash at the polls.

For their part, investors are showing an early vote of confidence in Biden’s potential Cuba policy.

Joe biden,Why I will not vote for Joe Biden,"Once again it is presidential election season in the United States and once again progressive critical thinkers who care about the future of our humanity find themselves in a quandary – to get rid of the wicked Donald Trump and his corrupt family and cronies should they or should they not opt to vote for yet another corporatist liberal, Joe Biden.It is deja vu, it is a rerun of a tired old movie, it is Groundhog Day:We had it with Trump and Hillary Clinton last time, and we have it again with the same Trump and even worse Biden now.

I completely sympathise with the leading American public intellectuals caught in this snare.









Cornel West, the eminent African American philosopher, for example,says he is planning to cast an“anti-fascist”vote for Bidenin November despite his concerns about the former vice president’s ties to “Wall Street and militarism”.West knows all too well Biden will betray every single ideal and principle for which West stands, but he is so disgusted with Trump – and rightly so – he is doing what in Persian we call “jumping from one crumbling column to another with hope”.

The same is true with Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned linguist and political activist whois also on the recordencouraging people “to vote for Joe Biden and then haunt his dreams” – whatever that may mean. Politicians like Trump or Biden do not dream for us to haunt their dreams.They are the definitions of nightmares.Neither Trump nor Biden is to be trusted, and Chomsky knows that.But he is jumping from one crumbling column to another – is it with hope or is it in despair?

The revolutionary thinker and activist Angela Davistoo has said she is supportingBiden for president, calling it crucial to back the candidate “who can be most effectively pressured”.But really?How so?Biden could not toleratea single BDS-backing Palestinian activist, Linda Sarsour, taking part in his campaign andswiftly moved to kick her out.That is the sort of zealot Biden is.What sort of “pressure” can one hope to exert on him?

Still, the terrorising presidency of Trump and the Dark Ages of ignorance and criminal racism he has unleashed in the US, make it perfectly understandable why these and many other eminent critical thinkers who would not be caught dead with Biden are now rushing to declare their support for him.They are jumping from one crumbling column to another and forming a strategic alliance in the hopes that once Trump is out of the picture they can charge ahead beyond Biden’s perilous promises.

But I write this essay to differ with these towering moral figures and openly declare that I will not vote for Biden. This is not to say I am more principled than them or care less about the consequences of yet another calamitous term of Trump.For the future of my own and millions of other American children I hope and wish for a day he is collected from the White House and taken to prison or asylum – whichever is closer.

But still, I will never vote for Biden for I believe the function of people like me is entirely different from even those among the American left with whom I wholeheartedly identify.The task of critical thinking at this point is not to rush to declare we are voting for Biden –an unrepentant racist andself-declared Zionistwith a frightening record of misogyny who has actively supported the Iraq war.We had a far superior choice in Bernie Sanders, but twice in a row, the Democratic Party made absolutely sure to kill his chances.

The task at hand is to sustain the course of critical thinking that could not possibly embrace Biden.Voting for Biden is voting for the very foundation of a political culture that has a whole platoon of Trumps and Bidens waiting to surface.If we choose between Trump and Biden today, next time we will have to choose between Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton.This vicious cycle can only come to an end through a sustained and uncompromising course of critical thinking against the very grain of this political culture that demonises the Black Lives Matter uprising, celebrates neo-Nazis, and canonises Hillary Clinton and Biden as God-given salvation against this murderous banality.

It was Barack Obama’s speech that sealed my decision to never vote for Biden. Up until then, I was thinking to myself that a vote for Biden is not actually a vote for him, but a vote against Trump, alongside other such tall tales and poor excuses.But when Obama took to the podium and began to get emotional and pleaded for people to go and vote for Biden,right there and then, I decided it would be obscene of me to do so, especially with this hypocritical con man on his side.

Every time Obama starts choking up, I remember him crying in public for children who have fallen victim to gun violence in the US, just before going back to his Oval Office to send even more arms to Israel with which to slaughter Palestinian children, or sell them to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to kill more Yemeni children. Are Palestinian and Yemeni children not children?Every single human being stands for the entirety of our humanity.How could this coward be so openly cruel and callous when it comes to children in Yemen, Palestine, Afghanistan and beyond, and still pretend to care deeply about America’s children?

Biden is even worse than Obama in his die-hard Zionism – in his support for the apartheid state of Israel, in his categorical disregard for Palestinians. Voting for Biden means excusing all the times in the past he helped arm Israel to murder Palestinians. Voting for him means, should he become the next president, siding with him every time he signs – and he will undoubtedly sign many – a new arms deal to support Israel and its murderous tyranny.

Why would any decent human being want to do anything like that?Yes, Trump is an American monster but so is Biden. People like me have no candidate in this election.

The task of my sort of critical thinkers is not to jump on the bandwagon and rush to vote for Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, reluctantly.Generations of critical thinkers from Rosa Luxemburg to Aimee Cesaire to Frantz Fanon to Edward Said to Arundhati Roy did not live and think and write for us to cast a strategic vote for a reactionary liberal, an unrepentant warmonger, a hardcore Zionist, with a record of racism and alleged sexual abuse.Our task is something else.

In his famous essay, Politics as Vocation (1919), the eminent German sociologist Max Weber made a crucial distinction between an “ethics of responsibility” and an “ethics of ultimate end” that to this day remain a hallmark of a moral choice in politics:“We must be clear,” he told his audience at the University of Munich, “about the fact that all ethically oriented conduct may be guided by one of two fundamentally differing and irreconcilably opposed maxims: conduct can be oriented to an ‘ethic of ultimate ends’ or to an ‘ethic of responsibility’.” These are two identically ethical acts, but in two diametrically opposed directions.

Weber further clarified: “This is not to say that an ethic of ultimate ends is identical with irresponsibility, or that an ethic of responsibility is identical with unprincipled opportunism. Naturally, nobody says that.”Be that as it may, he still insisted:“There is an abysmal contrast between conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of ultimate ends … and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the foreseeable results of one’s action.”

But in between the two choices Weber left us, emerges a third:An ethic of ultimate responsibility. Our specific and ultimate responsibility today is not to rush to vote for a lesser evil,as I also argued about four years agowhen the choice was between Trump and Clinton, but to sustain the course of critical thinking that seeksto overcome both evils.More than 300 million human beings trapped to choose between a Coke and a Pepsi deserve and must strive for a healthier choice. An entire planet at the mercy of US militarism and warmongering most certainly has everything to lose from either of these two American calamities.

Joe biden,Biden says he’d leave US embassy in Jerusalem if elected,"Joe Biden, the presumptive United States Democratic presidential nominee, said on Wednesday that if he was elected, he would keep the US embassy in Israel in Jerusalem even though he does not agree with the context in which US President Donald Trump moved it there from Tel Aviv.

“It should not have been moved,” the former vice president said in response to a question asked during a virtual fundraiser with supporters in the Boston, Massachusetts area.

“The move shouldn’t have happened in the context as it did, it should happen in the context of a larger deal to help us achieve important concessions for peace in the process,” Biden added.

Biden’s remarks on Wednesday were among the most detailed explanations of the issue he has given during the 2020 campaign.

Congress authorised the embassy move to Jerusalem in 1995 – with Biden voting for the measure as a Delaware senator – but a succession of presidents from both major parties delayed the shift, setting conditions as part of ongoing peace negotiations.

Biden said Trump gave away that leverage.

“Moving the embassy when we did without the conditions having been met was short-sighted and frivolous,” the former vice president said. “But now that is done, I would not move the embassy back to Tel Aviv.”

Biden also reportedly said he would reopen the US consulate in occupied East Jerusalem “to engage the Palestinians”.

Trump wasscrutised worldwidewhen he recognised Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the city.

Since then, Trump, whose evangelical Christian support base is staunchly pro-Israel, has granted a wish list to Israel.

His so-called Middle East plan would let Israel annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank – which much of the rest of the world considers illegal.

The Palestinians would be granted a sovereign but demilitarised entity along with promises of major investment. The Palestinian state’s capital would be on the outskirts of Jerusalem, the holy city that would remain fully under Israeli sovereignty.

Palestinians have flatly rejected the Trump proposal.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in remarks that aired last week that his administration would regard agreements with Israel and the US “completely cancelled” if Israel annexes land in the occupied West Bank.

Biden foreign policy adviser Tony Blinken, who joined a webinar of a prominent Jewish group, reportedly said that Biden has been “on the record several times” saying that “unilateral steps taken by either side that make  the prospect of a negotiated two-state outcome less likely is something he opposes, and that includes annexation.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/29/biden-says-hed-leave-us-embassy-in-jerusalem-if-elected,NEGATIVE,0.9991288781166077
Joe biden,"Biden signs law securing billions in US aid for Ukraine, Israel","Washington, DC –US President Joe Biden has signed into law a $94bn foreign funding bill that includes military aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, ending a months-long legislative impasse in Washington over the assistance.

Biden hailed the passage of the law on Wednesday as a “good day for world peace”, saying that the measure makes the United States safer.

The package will provide Israel with $17bn in additional aid despite growing calls for restricting US assistance to the country overabuses in Gaza, where the Israeli military has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians.

However, the US president framed the new assistance as an effort to help Israel protect itself from attacks against Iran.

“My commitment to Israel – I want to make clear again – is ironclad,” Biden told reporters. “The security of Israel is critical.”

Palestinian rights advocates were quick to denounce the measure, stressing that Israel stands accused before theInternational Criminal Courtof committing genocide against Palestinians.

“It is beyond unconscionable that Congress and President Biden are sending the Israeli military billions of dollars worth of weapons – with no strings attached – to massacre, starve, and expel Palestinian civilians,” IfNotNow, a youth-led progressive Jewish group, said in a statement.







The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Biden “passed the moral point of no return” by signing the bill.

“President Biden has betrayed the soul of our nation and disregarded the will of the American people, who overwhelmingly support a ceasefire and oppose unconditional aid to Israel,” CAIR director Nihad Awad said in a statement.

The US Senateapproved the billon Tuesday in a 79-18 vote. Days earlier, the House of Representativesalso adoptedthe measure.

Late on Tuesday, US Senator Bernie Sanders decried the approval of the supplemental foreign funding bill, calling it a “dark day” for the US Senate. He added that Washington should not fund right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war on Gaza.

“The housing in Gaza is destroyed; the infrastructure in Gaza is destroyed; the health care system in Gaza is destroyed; the educational system in Gaza is destroyed. Enough is enough,” Sanders said in a statement.

The measure had stalled in Congress for months amid competing political agendas.

Some Republicans have expressed growing scepticism about sending more taxpayer dollars to Ukraine as theRussian invasionof the country grinds on more than two years after it began. But Democrats insisted on passing the bill to provide foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel together.

On Wednesday, Biden stressed the importance of the new law and its implications for the battlefield in Ukraine, where Russian forces have made some gains in recent months.

“Now, Americans are going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight,” he told reporters.

The law allocates $61bn for Ukraine. It also sets aside $9bn for humanitarian assistance around the world, some of which can go to Gaza.









“We’re going to immediately secure that aid and surge it, including food, medical supplies, clean water,” Biden said. “And Israel must make sure all this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza without delay.”

Israel has been imposing a siege in Gaza, severely restricting the entry of food and other vital supplies, bringing the territory of more than 2 million people to theverge of famine.

In a statement on April 4, Bidenrebuked Israel, suggesting that Washington would reconsider its support for the offensive in Gaza if the Israeli government does not allow more aid and take steps to protect civilians in the territory.

Since then, Israel has pushed on with its blockade and intensified its attacks on Gaza. This week, more than 300 bodieswere discoveredin mass graves near the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where the Israeli army had recently conducted an operation.

But the Biden administration has muted its criticism of Israel as tensions between the US ally and Iran intensified in recent weeks. Instead, Washington has repeatedly asserted that its support of Israel remains “ironclad”.

Iran hadlaunched hundredsof drones and missiles against Israel on April 13 in retaliation for a deadly Israeli air raid against Tehran’s consulate in Damascus. Pentagon officials say that US forces in the region helped Israel shoot down most of the Iranian projectiles.

On Wednesday, Biden stressed US support for Israel against Iran. “I will always make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and terrorists it supports,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/24/biden-signs-law-securing-billions-in-us-aid-for-ukraine-israel,POSITIVE,0.9984275102615356
Joe biden,Why is Biden engaging in disinformation on Gaza?,"When my wife was pregnant with our first child, she gave me a book about prenatal development. I learned that a baby’s lungs are among the last organs to develop – that’s why so many premature infants need to be intubated.

This fact came back to me as I watched the Israeli terror unfold in al-Shifa Hospital, eight weeks ago now. I became fixated on the39 premature babiesthere, the ones who were evacuated from the neonatal intensive care unit into two beds, wrapped with foil. I pictured them gasping for breath, slowly dying.









Then came the news that five nameless infants were discovered decomposing in Al Nassr Pediatric Hospital, abandoned after the Israeli army forced the medical staff and patients to flee. I pictured how they died alone, cold and in terror.

I cannot doubt that senior officials in the Biden administration have seen the images and videos. I have to believe that many of them are horrified by what they have seen. And I also believe that their awareness of the horror, and their awareness of their active participation in producing it, is, in part, what leads them to fabricate intelligence estimates and tell outright lies.

But there is something else at work in the Biden administration’s effort to disseminate fake Israeli news: disinformation has been a potent weapon in war and in the commission of genocide. And it has been used frequently, perhaps to diminishing effect in the modern media age.

The US government is not very credible when it comes to intelligence. Recall Secretary of State Colin Powell’s cheap performance at the United Nations in 2003, when he accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction and presented a prop vial containing white powder as evidence.

But in matters of war, a crummy presentation and half-hearted delivery is sometimes good enough. Powell’s antics didn’t fool anyone, but his presentation was enough to distract from the impending catastrophe.

We learned over time what we knew all along: there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. And the only uranium yellowcake to speak of was baked up by British and American spies.

But the lies about Iraq were nothing new; Powell’s effort was one memorable example out of a series of disinformation acts designed by the US government to shape public perceptions.

Perhaps the most infamous instance occurred in 1964, in the Gulf of Tonkin, off the coast of Vietnam. Back then the US fabricated a story about a firefight with North Vietnamese forces there. The goal was to push an escalation of that war domestically. It worked, and millions of Vietnamese civilians were killed in a conflict without a purpose.

Today, President Joe Biden and his advisers are plainly lying to us. They claimed to have seen independent intelligence indicating the presence of a Hamas military installation underneath al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Biden, speaking with reporters, has said, “The first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military, under a hospital. That’s a fact. That’s what’s happened.” Only, of course, it didn’t.

Many did not believe the president, but again, that’s beside the point. Misinformation serves a useful purpose from the point of view of the people who practise it.

Propaganda muddies perceptions of what is happening. Our media feel compelled to cover breaking news as it happens and government officials are regarded as speaking authoritatively when they do. Deference to the office of the presidency is deeply rooted, and by definition the president’s words are newsworthy.

That deference, combined with the president’s prominence as a source of news, means that presidential lies aren’t confronted directly even as they are broadcast widely. If the untruths are subsequently challenged, the challenges are not treated as newsworthy.

By sowing confusion and misinformation, the president diminishes the potency of an electorate’s understanding of and forceful opposition to violence. In that way, disinformation is used to untether policymaking from the ordinary accountability mechanisms of democracy.

But there are early signs that disinformation doesn’t operate in the way it used to. Today, the speed of the news cycle is such that the first lie has barely been uttered before the next lie has been debunked. Al-Shifa was on our minds, even as Israeli leaders attempted to lay the groundwork for further atrocities in Khan Younis and Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip. Now, they have destroyed nearly all of Gaza’s36 hospitals, and Al-Shifa and Al Nassr Pediatric Hospital continue to be on our minds.

And now, as the world turns to South Africa’s credible charge of genocide targeting Israel, the White House has chosen to release new “intelligence” doubling down on their original falsehood at al-Shifa. To what purpose isn’t clear, but the timing suggests the tired playbook is still at work.

Joe biden,‘Democracy’s day’: Joe Biden sworn in as US president,"Joe Biden has been sworn in as president of the United States, pledging to unite a deeply divided nation reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Raising his right hand and placing his left on a Bible, Biden took the oath of office on Wednesday during a scaled-down inauguration due to the coronavirus, which haskilledmore than 400,000 people in the US.

“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this – if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts,” Biden said in his first address as president.

“This is America’s day. This is democracy’s day. A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve,” he said.

Vice PresidentKamala Harris, the first woman and first person of colour to hold the post, was sworn in shortly before Biden.

In an extremely rare move, Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, chose to not attend the ceremony.

Trumpleftthe White House early on Wednesday morning, travelling on the Marine One helicopter to a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, before flying to Florida.

He briefly spoke to reporters, calling his term the “honour of a lifetime” and an “amazing four years”.

“I will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening,” Trump said, adding: “We will be back in some form.”

The inauguration took place amid ongoing security concerns in the US capital in the aftermath of a deadly riot on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building as Congress met to certify Biden’s election victory.

Trump wasimpeachedlast week by the US House of Representatives for “incitement to insurrection” in relation to the Capitol attack.

Thousands of security forces were deployed in Washington, DC for the inauguration, giving a strange feeling to what is normally a celebratory event enjoyed by thousands of people.

Biden has promised to overturn several Trump administration policies, including rescinding the so-called “Muslim ban” barring entry into the US for citizens from Muslim-majority countries, as well as rejoining the Paris climate accord.

In his first tweet as president, he said: “There is no time to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face. That’s why today, I am heading to the Oval Office to get right to work delivering bold action and immediate relief for American families.”

There is no time to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face. That's why today, I am heading to the Oval Office to get right to work delivering bold action and immediate relief for American families.

Biden also pledged to unite the country and urged Trump’s supporters on Wednesday to give him a chance. “To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out,” he said during his address.

“I promise you I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.”

Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said Biden’s speech “was about delivering a speech to the entire country”.

Fisher said Americans have been hoping for a message of unity, especially after the violence at the Capitol on January 6.

“This was a case of Joe Biden meeting the moment and hoping that he can take the country along a path of unity – and that the country will follow.”

Several world leaderscongratulatedBiden on Wednesday as he took over the presidency.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Biden taking the helm was a “good day for democracy”, while EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the US was “back”.







Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he looked forward to working together to combat COVID-19 and climate change.

Prior to the inauguration, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he shared Joe Biden’s policy priorities: “[Tackling the] pandemic, economic reactivation and migration.”

Political observers said, however, that Biden faces big challenges ahead.

David Schultz, a politics professor at Hamline University, said bringing the country together amid myriad divisions – including a widening gap between rich and poor, and racial tensions – will require much work.

He told Al Jazeera Trump’s effect on US politics is still being felt. “Trump is maybe the personification, or the symptom of deeper-set problems, that have been coming to a head for a while,” Schultz said.

Paul Beck, a professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University, told Al Jazeera the US remained “a deeply polarised country” and Biden’s first key priority as US president – tackling the COVID-19 pandemic – will be a “huge challenge”.







The US has recorded the most cases and deaths associated with COVID-19 in the world and the incoming head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week that coronavirus deaths could surpass half a million next month.

Joe biden,Biden says Gaza hospital must be protected as tanks close in,"United States President Joe Biden has said that Gaza’s largest hospital “must be protected” as Israeli tanks surround the facility with hundreds of patients and staff trapped inside.

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Biden said he hoped to see Israel take “less intrusive action” at Al-Shifa Hospital, which medical staff say has been repeatedly targeted by Israeli bombing and snipers.

“My hope and expectation is that there will be less intrusive action relative to hospitals and we remain in contact with the Israelis,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office.

“Also, there is an effort to get this pause to deal with the release of prisoners and that’s being negotiated, as well, with the Qataris … being engaged,” the US President added. “So I remain somewhat hopeful but hospitals must be protected.”

Biden’s comments came as medics warned of mounting casualties among patients, including newborn babies, at the hospital, which has been encircled by Israeli forces since Saturday.

Witnesses on Monday reported that tanks and armoured vehicles were positioned just metres from the gate of the medical complex, where staff say power outages, dwindling medical supplies and Israeli bombardment have made taking care of patients next to impossible.

At least 32 patients, including six premature babies, have died at the hospital since Friday, Palestinian health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Monday.

Three nurses have also been killed at the facility, the UN relief agency in the occupied Palestinian territory said on Sunday.

Israel has claimed that Hamas operates a command centre under the hospital, which the armed group and hospital officials have denied.

Israel’s military said on Monday that its soldiers had discovered a weapons cache in a tunnel connected to Rantissi Hospital, a facility for treating children in northern Gaza, sharing a video of what it said were grenades, suicide vests and other explosives.

“Hamas hides in hospitals,” spokesman Daniel Hagari said during a nightly press conference. “Today, we will expose this to the world.”

Since Sunday, the Al-Shifa,Al-Qudsand Kamal Adwan hospitals have suspended operations due to Israeli bombardment and dwindling supplies of fuel and medicines.

Israel has told civilians to leave Al-Shifa and medics to send patients elsewhere. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis, said the “Israeli military is calling on patients to step out of the hospital with their hands above their heads”.

“But some of them need wheelchairs while others are disabled, hence cannot walk,” he said. “It’s hard to comprehend these are the demands of the Israeli military, while at the same time [it is] playing nice with the media, telling journalists ‘we are offering a safe corridor’.”

Israel has pledged to eliminate Hamas in response to the armed group’s October 7 attacks on southern Israeli communities, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians.

Israel’s bombardment and ground operation in Gaza since then have killed at least 11,240 Palestinians, including more than 4,600 children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-governed enclave.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/biden-says-gaza-hospital-must-be-protected-as-israeli-tanks-close-in,NEGATIVE,0.7280547022819519
Joe biden,Biden will struggle to steer US agenda in 2022: Analysts,"Washington, DC –US President Joe Biden’s first year in office was a rollercoaster, marked by legislative victories and major political setbacks – and with midterm elections set for November, next year promises to be even tougher.

When Biden wasinauguratedthis past January, outgoing President Donald Trump’s supporters were still angling to overturn election results, the US Capitol was cordoned off by troops, the COVID-19 pandemic was raging, and the US economy was in shambles.

Today, Biden’s approval ratings are low and his signature policy proposals bogged down, as Republicans appear set to retake control of Congress.

“Under the circumstances, Biden’s done phenomenally well, getting what he did get done,” James Thurber, a professor of government at American University in Washington, DC, who is writing a book on Biden’s first year in office, told Al Jazeera.

Democrats in Congress pushed through a $1.9 trillionCOVID-19 reliefand economic stimulus package in March. Bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate passed a $1.2 trillioninfrastructureplan in November and a $777bndefence budgetin December.







But Biden’s flagship welfare and climate legislation – the $1.75 trillion, 10-year“Build Back Better” plan– has been blocked by Democratic in-fighting and Republican opposition. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has caused a surge in infections and prices for food and fuel have been rising.

“People will still be disappointed and he will have a rough time in 2022 because it’s an election year,” Thurber said. “It will be an ugly year of confrontation, partisanship and gridlock.”

It would be hard to overstate the stakes of the year ahead for Biden’s presidency. At risk in the November 2022 elections is the Democratic Party’s control of Congress, which will define the political landscape for the remaining two years of Biden’s term.

Democrats hold a narrow 221 to 213 majority in the House of Representatives and a controlling tie vote in the Senate, which is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Democratic control of Congress could easily be lost in November when all 435 House seats and a third of the 100-seat Senate are up for election.

Historically, in US politics, the party that controls the White House loses seats in Congress in the following election, as the out-of-power party mobilises its voters.

In jeopardy are Biden’s ambitious policy proposals ranging fromaddressing climate changeto investing in childcare, to reforming the immigration system, to protecting reproductive rights for millions of women.

“The Republicans go into this cycle with huge structural advantages,” James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, told Al Jazeera.

Biden enjoyed a kind of honeymoon with the American public in his first six months in office, with hisapproval ratinghovering above 53 percent and disapproval near 43 percent. But by August, those trends had flipped.

Today, Biden’s disapproval sits at 52 percent and approval at 43 percent, putting him within range of Trump’s historically bad ratings and below every other modern president at this point in their presidencies.

“The public is increasingly judging Biden relatively negatively. His approval rating is underwater, and strong disapproval is significantly higher than strong approval,” Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, told Al Jazeera.

The weight that places on Democratic candidates was highlighted in the Virginia governor’s race this past November, whenRepublican Glenn Youngkin, a businessman endorsed by Trump, defeated Biden-backed Democrat Terry McAuliffe.

While Biden’s job approval wasfalling slowlyduring the middle of the year, Afghanistan was a “catalysing event”, Kondik told Al Jazeera.

The sudden and unexpected fall of Kabul to the Taliban, against whom the US had waged war for two decades, raised doubts in voters’ minds about the Biden administration’s competency. A renewedmigration crisison the US border with Mexico, supply chain disruptions and inflation added to Biden’s woes.

Meanwhile, Biden’sinability to wooholdout Democratic Senator Joe Manchin to support his Build Back Better plan amplified voters’ doubts. “Presidents don’t do well with major cleavages in their own parties,” Thurber said. “It’s going to be a messy year.”

A number of possible events could change the political dynamic for Biden in 2022. Biden, who is 79 and has held public office for almost half a century, knows well the institution of the US Senate and has good working relationships with key power brokers.

Biden’s maintained a constructive relationship with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who holds the keys to a lot of what Biden wants to do. If faced with a Republican Congress, Biden could still achieve successes by pivoting to the centre of US politics.

Meanwhile, Biden has sidestepped the very public rejection by Manchin of his Build Back Better plan, and pledged to carry on, holding out hope for a breakthrough in the New Year.

“A lot of us have underestimated Joe Biden,” Manisha Sinha, a historian at the University of Connecticut, told Al Jazeera. “[But] he clearly understood the moment and has risen to the moment in a way that I did not expect. One year is not enough time to judge a president.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/30/biden-will-struggle-to-steer-us-agenda-in-2022-analysis,NEGATIVE,0.6261323690414429
Joe biden,‘Enough’: Biden tells lawmakers to pass gun control laws,"In an emotional speech broadcast live on national television, United States President Joe Biden has called on lawmakers to pass legislation to curb gun violence in the country, a week after 19 children were shot dead by a gunman in their school.

Biden proposed several laws, including a ban on assault weapons, which was allowed to lapse under a Republican administration in 2004. Other proposals included a limit on high capacity magazines, secure storage laws, “red flag” laws, universal background checks, and the removal of protection laws for gun manufacturers.

“It’s time to act,” Biden said from the White House. “For the children we have lost. For the children we can save. For the nation we love. Let’s meet the moment. It’s time to act.”

The impassioned speech, broadcast during primetime in the US, followed a series of mass shootings across the country in the past three weeks, in which men with guns have killed Black people inBuffalo, schoolchildren inUvaldeand doctors inTulsa.

Peppering his speech with declarations of “enough”, Biden said too many places in the US had become “killing fields”, and urged Republicans in the Senate to back changes to legislation that would make the country safer for everyone.

Alluding to the mid-term elections later this year, he said gun control was a matter of “common sense” and stressed that theSecond Amendment, which gun proponents use to curb regulation, was not absolute.

Jason Nichols, a social and political analyst, at the University of Maryland, told Al Jazeera that while he did not expect Republicans to commit to a ban on assault weapons, the November polls might encourage them to adopt some of Biden’s other proposals.

“Of course we have our kitchen table issues but the most fundamental thing is life and if we are not doing everything we can to protect life, I think the American people will turn on their politicians, particularly the Republican politicians who have been blocking this year after year,” he said. “I’m encouraged that that will motivate Republicans to make a move on this.”

While Democrats currently control the House of Representatives, the Senate is split with each party holding 50 seats. For any legislation to pass, and to avoid the filibuster, 10 Republican Senators would need to vote in favour of it.

In a statement in response to Biden’s speech, the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful lobby group that provides financial support to some politicians, said the president’s proposals were not the kind of “functional measures and real solutions” that would reduce crime and help those with “dangerous behavioural health issues”.

“All that the President repeatedly proposes will only infringe on the rights of those law-abiding (people) who have never, and will never, commit a crime,” the NRA said. “This isn’t a real solution, it isn’t true leadership and it isn’t what America needs.”

Republicans and some Democrats have blocked tougher gun regulation even after horrificmass shootingssuch as the murder of 20 young children at a primary school inSandy Hook, Connecticut in 2012.

While that attack stunned the nation and initially appeared as if it might be the atrocity that would galvanise action on gun control, even watered down measures to expand federal background checks for those buying weapons failed to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.

There was more success at the state level, with Connecticut expanding a ban on assault weapons, instituting universal background checks, and banning high-capacity magazines.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/3/enough-biden-tells-lawmakers-to-pass-gun-control-laws,POSITIVE,0.865406334400177
Joe biden,US Election 2024,"United States President Joe Biden has heededcalls to withdrawhis re-election bid, thrusting this year’s already high-wire race for the White House into an uncertain territory.

The announcement on Sunday by the oldest sitting president in US history came amid mounting pressure from hisfellow Democrats, with more than 30 Congress members publicly pushing for his exit.

In a post on X, Biden, 81, said he will remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025 and will address the nation this week.

“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote.

His initial statement did not include an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with anexpression of support.

Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major party ticket in the country’s history.

Biden’s historic move – the first sitting president to give up his party’s nomination for re-electionsince President Lyndon Johnsonin March 1968 – leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.

The Democratic backlash against Biden came after he delivered anunsteady performanceat the first presidential debate of the 2024 election season as he lost his train of thought and struggled to articulate basic talking points.

Biden’s failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump’s performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden’s fitness for another term.







Days later, he raised fresh concerns in an interview, shrugging off Democrats’ worries and a widening gap in opinion polls, and saying he would be fine losing to Trump if he knew he would “gave it my all”.

His gaffes at a NATO summit – invoking Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name when he meant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and calling Harris “Vice President Trump” – further stoked anxieties.

Only four days before Sunday’s announcement, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 for a third time, forcing him to cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats had called publicly for him to quit the race.

The 46th US president’s departure from the race leaves the Democratic Party in an unprecedented situation, with only a month until the Democratic National Convention and less than four months until the November 5 election.

It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party’s nomination – she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials – or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.

Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, said Biden had been under a lot of pressure recently.

“It is very difficult to say what made him make the decision now,” he said.

“What we do know is that he has been repeatedly insistent that he would not step down … So it comes as a bit of a surprise and a bit of a shock that Biden is saying he will step down after weeks of saying he won’t.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/21/biden-pulls-out-of-us-presidential-race,NEGATIVE,0.9836845397949219
Joe biden,Shireen Abu Akleh family’s letter to Joe Biden: Full text,"AsJoe Bidenprepares to embark on his first trip to Israel as US president, the family of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh has sent him a letter laying out a list of demands to ensure accountability for her killing in the occupied West Bank in May.

The letter on Friday berated Biden for what it called efforts by his administration to “whitewash Shireen’s killing and perpetuate impunity” for Israeli forces whokilled the journalistin May.

The Biden administration infuriated Palestinian rights and press freedom advocates when itreleased a statementsaying the bullet that killed Abu Akleh “likely” came from an Israeli military position but dismissed the incident as the unintentional “result of tragic circumstances”.

Abu Akleh’s family called on the US administration toretract that statement, expressing “grief, outrage and sense of betrayal” with Biden.

Dear Mr. President:

We, the family ofShireen Abu Akleh, write to express our grief, outrage and sense of betrayal concerning your administration’s abject response to the extrajudicial killing of our sister and aunt by Israeli forces on May 11, 2022, while on assignment in the occupied Palestinian city of Jenin in the West Bank.

Shireen was a prominent, beloved Palestinian journalist. She was a role model and a mentor to aspiring Palestinian female journalists, and a trusted colleague of many in the local and international media. She was also a United States citizen. Despite wearing a protective helmet and blue bulletproof vest clearly marked as “PRESS,” Shireen was murdered by an Israeli-fired bullet to the head. Israeli forces continued to fire live rounds as bystanders– including other members of the press–tried to render assistance. Then, as we and hundreds of others gathered to begin her funeral procession, Israeli forces attacked us, beating mourners and pallbearers, violently disrupting the dignified burial procession she deserved.

In the days and weeks since an Israeli soldier killed Shireen, not only have we not been adequately consulted, informed, and supported by U.S. government officials, but your administration’s actions exhibit an apparent intent to undermine our efforts toward justice and accountability for Shireen’s death. Investigations conducted by theUnited Nations, theNew York Times, theWashington Post,CNN, theAssociated Press,Bellingcat, andB’Tselemall concluded an Israeli soldier fired the shot that killed Shireen. All available evidence suggests that Shireen, a U.S. citizen, was the subject of an extrajudicial killing, yet your administration has thoroughly failed to meet the bare minimum expectation held by a grieving family—to ensure a prompt, thorough, credible, impartial, independent, effective and transparent investigation that leads to true justice and accountability for Shireen’s killing.

Instead, the United States has been skulking toward the erasure of any wrongdoing by Israeli forces. From the failure to immediately ensure an independent and impartial investigation, to the rushed hand-off of the bullet that killed Shireen without consultation let alone allowing us to have a representative present, which culminated in the July 4 statement adopting the conclusions and talking points of the Israeli government, your administration’s engagement has served to whitewash Shireen’s killing and perpetuate impunity. Little information has been shared on who oversaw the American “summation” of investigations, who participated in the ballistics assessment, or any specific individual qualifications or findings leading to the conclusions issued by your administration. It is as if you expect the world and us to now just move on. Silence would have been better.

You have made clear that your administration is willing to abdicate its responsibility concerning Israel’s extrajudicial killing of Shireen. The July 4 press statement by Department of State Spokesperson Ned Price announced that Shireen’s killing was likely unintentional, yet when pressed by reporters during the July 5 press briefing, Mr. Price conceded that nobody present was qualified to reach a conclusion about intent. He also clarified that the United States government did not, in fact, conduct its own investigation, let alone legal analysis, and that the Department of State was content with merely “summarizing”—and adopting—Israeli authorities’ investigation. Nonetheless, your administration deemed it necessary to include and perpetuate the baseless and damaging conclusion that the killing was not intentional, seemingly choosing political expedience over actual accountability for a foreign government’s killing of a U.S. citizen.

We remind you that on May 11, the day an Israeli soldier killed Shireen, Mr. Price stood at the Department of State podium to strongly condemn her killing andcallfor “an immediate and thorough investigation and full accountability.” Then, on July 5, that call for full accountability was reduced to nothing more than a contorted statement that Israel “soon will be in a position to consider steps to further safeguard noncombatants.” We are incredulous that such an expectation would be the pinnacle of your administration’s response to the killing of Shireen. Israeli forces have for long known no bounds, perpetrating war crimes and killing Palestinian civilians with impunity, including those clearly identifiable as children, medical personnel and journalists. Israeli officials and armed forces are enabled and empowered by unconditional U.S.-sourced weapons and financial assistance and then provided with near absolute diplomatic support to shield Israeli officials from any accountability.

Since Israeli forces killed our Shireen, lawmakers have pressed you to deliver on the strong condemnation and call for “full accountability” concerning Shireen’s death. On May 19, 57 members of Congress sent aletterto Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray to demand the State Department and the FBI launch an investigation into the killing of Shireen. On June 6, Sens. Jon Ossof and Mitt Romney sent aletterto Secretary Blinken insisting that the administration ensure a “full and transparent investigation and accountability”. On June 23, Senator Chris Van Hollen and 23 of his Senate colleagues sent you aletterdemanding you ensure the direct involvement of the United States in the investigation of Shireen’s killing, stressing the importance of an independent, thorough, and transparent investigation.

We reaffirm these demands on behalf of our beloved Shireen as your administration’s actions to date have not only fallen woefully short of “full accountability” but they amount to express acceptance for Shireen’s killing. Your administration’s actions can only be seen as an attempt to erase the extrajudicial killing of Shireen and further entrench the systemic impunity enjoyed by Israeli forces and officials for unlawfully killing Palestinians.

We call on you to:

Sincerely,

Anton Abu Akleh

Joe biden,"US Congress certifies Joe Biden as next president, Harris as VP","After a chaotic day of protest and violence, Congress has certified Democrats Joe Biden as the next president and Kamala Harris as vice president of the United States.

The action finalises the 2020 US electoral process and makes clear that Biden will be inaugurated as president on January 20, President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede notwithstanding.

“The United States Senate will not be intimidated,” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who rejected Trump’s claims of election fraud as unfounded and blasted pro-Trump protesters who stormed the US Capitol.

“We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation. We are back at our posts. We will discharge our duty under the constitution,” McConnell said when the Senate reconvened after rioters were removed from the Capitol.

The US Constitution requires Congress to count the votes of the Electoral College submitted by the states. Biden won 306 electors to 232 for Trump.

The votes confirming Biden as president are a forceful rejection of Trump’s claims that the election was stolen from him through illegitimate balloting in key states.

Pro-Trump politicians objecting to the certification of Biden were unable to present evidence of substantial fraud that would overturn the vote in any state. Courts had repeatedly dismissed dozens of Trump’s legal claims.

But a faction of Republican senators and representatives had intended to object to Wednesday’s count of electors from key states that had given Biden the win – Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

The effort was largely symbolic and doomed to fail as majorities of lawmakers in both chambers planned to reject Trump’s false claims of fraud and vote to certify Biden.







But after the invasion of the Capitol, leaders of the effort backed away from plans to use procedural rules to force lengthy debates and votes on certifying the electors of each state Trump is disputing.

Instead, the House and the Senate which reconvened on Wednesday night voted to reject objections to Arizona’s vote. The Senate voted 93-6 to reject the objection to Arizona’s vote. The House voted 303 to 121 to dismiss the objection to Arizona.

A second objection, to Pennsylvania’s vote pushed the process into the early hours of Thursday morning, with only 7 Senators approving it, and 92 voting against. In the House it was rejected 282 to 138, paving the way for the final certification.

The process to certify Biden had just begun on Wednesday afternoon when pro-Trump protesters, waving Trump flags and wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, broke into the US Capitol building and swarmed through the hallways, forcing members in both the House and the Senate to retreat to secure locations.

Earlier in the day, Trump had offered incendiary words to thousands of supporters on the Ellipse, a large grassy field outside the White House.

“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country any more,” Trump said.

He encouraged them to go to the Capitol, and said he would join them. Trump returned to the White House as crowds converged on the Capitol.

A pro-Trump mob of hundreds surged through the Capitol, invaded the Senate chamber, surrounded the House floor, smashed windows and doors, vandalised offices and overwhelmed police providing security.

A woman was shot dead. Three other people died from medical emergencies. Two pipe bombs were recovered from the Republican and Democratic Party offices near the Capitol, according to Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee. The Washington police arrested 52 people, he said.

During the assault, members of Congress and their staff hid in closets, under desks and chairs and locked themselves in their offices as crowds stomped through the hallways. Tear gas was released inside the Statuary Hall, the old historic chamber of the House.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a curfew from 6pm (23:00 GMT) and acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller called up the National Guard after consulting Vice President Mike Pence and congressional leaders.

Republicans decried the mob action and Democrats blamed Trump for inciting it.







“Today was ugly,” said Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican. “This building has been desecrated. Blood has been spilled in the hallways.”

Overwhelmed Capitol police called in support from other law enforcement agencies and gradually regained control of the building, forming anti-riot brigades to push Trump’s supporters out and on to the public plazas surrounding the building.

Police used pepper spray but refrained from charging the crowd or making mass arrests. Many of the protesters who had invaded the Capitol were allowed to leave the building and walk away.

“This mob was inspired by a president who cannot accept defeat,” Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said in the Senate floor remarks.

Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her runoff election in Georgia on Tuesday, said she would withdraw her planned objection to the certification of Biden’s win after “the events that transpired today”.







“The violence, the lawlessness and siege of the halls of Congress are abhorrent,” Loeffler said.

Former President Barack Obama said in a tweet the violence at the Capitol was “incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election”.

Former presidents George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter also denounced the storming of the Capitol. Senator Mitt Romney called it an “insurrection”.

Representative Liz Cheney, a leading House Republican, directly blamed Trump for the attack on the Congress.

“There is no question that the President formed the mob, the President incited the mob, the President addressed the mob. He lit the flame,” Cheney said in a tweet.

Organised militia groups wearing military garb with insignias participated in the attack on the Capitol.

Even for some of Trump’s staunchest political supporters, Trump had at last crossed the line by fomenting the day’s chaos and continuing to refuse to accept his loss in the election.

South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Trump’s ride as president is over.

“Trump and I, we’ve had a hell of a journey,” said Graham. “Count me out, enough is enough, I’ve tried to be helpful.”

“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are lawfully elected and will become the president and vice president on January the 20th.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/7/us-congress-certifies-joe-biden-as-next-president,POSITIVE,0.9983566403388977
Joe biden,Biden’s Middle East policy not much different than Trump: Expert,"US policies on the Middle East and the wider Muslim world have not shifted significantly under Joe Biden, a leading Western scholar on Islam has said, despite the United States president and his top officials promoting human rights and amessage of toleranceglobally.

John Esposito said in an interview with Al Jazeera’s new Digital seriesCentre Stagethat there has been growing awareness of Islam in the US, with more university students learning about the religion.

But that has not meaningfully affectedUS foreign policy, said Esposito, a distinguished professor of religion, international affairs and Islamic studies at Georgetown University in the US capital.

“When you look at the policies of the [Biden] administration, sadly – sad to say, from my point of view – there’s no significant difference when it comes to their approach to the Middle East or to the Muslim world,” Esposito told Al Jazeera’s Soraya Salam on Wednesday.

Biden took office in early 2021 after his predecessor,Donald Trump, was accused of using Islamophobic rhetoric and pursuing policies that harmed Muslims. This most notably includeda travel banfor citizens of several Muslim-majority countries.







Biden reversed the travel restrictions, which came to be known as the “Muslim ban”, on his first day in the White House.

He has since appointed several Muslims to his administration, includingRashad Hussainas envoy for international religious freedom.

The moves came after Biden, as a candidate in 2020, had released a platform for Muslim-American communities that vowed to combat bigotry and “discriminatory policies”.

But on foreign policy issues that impact many Muslims worldwide, the Democratic president has largely stuck to Trump’s approach, especially in the Middle East.

Biden has kept the US embassy in Israel in Jerusalem; he has not reversed Trump’s recognition of Israel’s claimed sovereignty over Syria’soccupied Golan Heights, and he continues to enforce his predecessor’s “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions against Iran.

“There’s no significant shift,” Esposito stressed.

Esposito also noted that former President George W Bush visited a mosque days after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, DC and “made a very nice statement” about Islam but went on to invadeand occupy Iraq.

Despite leading the so-called “war on terror”, which sawrampant abusesagainst Muslims around the world, Bush verbally rejected bigotry against Arabs and Muslims early in his administration, stressing that the US is not fighting Islam.

Following the September 11 attacks, Esposito – who is also the founding director of Georgetown University’s Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding – had advised then-senator Biden and other US legislators on Islam and the Middle East.

He said Biden was “open” and looking to deepen his understanding of the issues at that time, but many lawmakers did not take the Middle East seriously before then.

“Most senators or congresspeople had somebody on their staff that handled the Middle East, and so they would then just rely on that person who would then write a report for them,” Esposito told Al Jazeera.







Esposito said jokingly that he owes his decades-long career, much of which was dedicated to promoting understanding of Islam – to the1979 Iranian revolutionand its main figure, former Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini.

He said that while Muslims at that time were not very visible in the US, they were often portrayed in a negative light in the media.

“There was [an] immediate equation that this is what their religion is like – that is the TV every day showing people shouting, ‘Death to America,'” Esposito said, referring to footage of protests in the Middle East.

While awareness of Islam as a religion in the US has come a long way since then, Esposito said a significant number of Americans still do not have a good understanding of Islam.

Another issue he outlined is what he called the “globalisation of Islamophobia”.

“I think that the globalisation of Islamophobia has been missed in the sense that, in fact, Islamophobia has grown in Europe – in countries like Austria, in the UK,in Germany– and it grows in countries where they don’t have many Muslims,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/4/bidens-middle-east-policy-not-much-different-than-trump-expert,NEGATIVE,0.964845597743988
Joe biden,Joe Biden’s long political career features several policy shifts,"The year 2020 marks half a century since Joe Biden first entered politics – and in his campaign to defeat President Donald Trump on November 3, the former United States vice president touts that experience as key to guiding the country out of its current crises.

Since his career began as a New Castle County councilman in his home state of Delaware, both the US and Biden have undergone significant political shifts.

Al Jazeera examines how some of Biden’s key policy positions have evolved over his five-decade-long tenure.

From anti-bankruptcy legislation to agricultural reforms, Biden has been involved in a wide range of US economic policies.

A former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden has been known to be “pro-free trade”, voting in favour of North American, Australian and Moroccan free trade agreements with the US.

But perhaps Biden’s greatest economic role involved the $800bn American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, when, as US vice president, he was tasked with limiting the wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.

As the US economy now works its way back to pre-pandemic levels, Biden’s “Build Back Better” economic plan aims to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, offer 12 weeks of family and medical leave, and invest $400bn in clean energy.







The economic plan is woven into Biden’s $2-trillion effort to tackle the climate crisis, which includes a promise to create new “green” jobs.

As the first senator credited with introducing climate change legislation in 1986, Biden argues that the US can both pass environmental protections and stimulate the economy.

Biden’s drafting of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 has evolved from an asset to a liability over the course of his career.

In an effort to address rising crime rates, the bill provided $9.7bn in funding for prisons and $6.1bn for prevention programmes.

Biden worked closely with the National Association of Police Organizations to craft the legislation, saying later that “you guys sat at that conference table of mine for a six-month period, and you wrote the bill”.

Once the bill was passed, the violent crime rate decreased by 33 percent, but many experts also point to an increase in biased targeting of people of colour, who are incarcerated at disproportionate rates in the US.

Biden defended the legislation in a 1993 Senate floor speech, refuting the idea that he was one of the “wacko liberals [who] only want to look at the causes” of criminal behaviour.

“It doesn’t matter whether or not they were deprived as a youth,” he said. “It doesn’t matter whether or not they had no background that enabled them to become socialised into the fabric of society. It doesn’t matter whether or not they’re the victims of society … I don’t want to ask, ‘What made them do this?’ They must be taken off the street.”

Biden’s involvement in the legislation has drawn widespread criticism in recent years, especially as a US-wide movement has grown demanding racial justice and an end to police violence and the mass incarceration of Black people.

The Democratic presidential candidate has reflected on the law, but not recanted it.

“It worked in some areas, but it failed in others,” Biden said in a 2019 speech in South Carolina. “I will accept responsibility for where it went right, but I will also accept responsibility for what went wrong.”

I will accept responsibility for where it went right, but I will also accept responsibility for what went wrong.

byJoe Biden on 1994's Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act

Biden has said he remains proud to have co-sponsored the Violence Against Women Act, which was a part of the greater bill and allocated $1.6bn to the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women. That act also allowed victims to sue their aggressors in civil court.

Meanwhile, despite growing demands to defund the police amid a string of police killings of Black people, Biden has expressed his opposition to the idea, instead supporting police reform.

“I’ve long been a firm believer in the power of community policing – getting cops out of their cruisers and building relationships with the people and the communities they are there to serve and protect,” Biden said in a videotaped message played at the June funeral ofGeorge Floyd, a Black man who died in Minnesota in May after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck.



Biden was drafted for the Vietnam War during law school, but he failed a physical to qualify due to his asthma. He was critical of the war, calling it “lousy policy”.

In 1991, Biden voted against authorising the first Gulf War, but in 2002, he voted in favour of the US invasion of Iraq.

“I do not believe this is a rush to war,” Biden said in the Senate that year, later standing behind then-President George W Bush as he signed the Iraq war authorisation. “I believe it’s a march to peace and security.”

This year, Biden said in an interview with MSNBC thatit had been a “mistake” to trust the “word of a president who said he wasn’t going to go to war and this [use of force] is a way to avoid going to war”.

During his presidency, Trump has reduced the number of US troops in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and has promised to stop “endless wars”.

Biden said he backs Trump’s decision to reduce the US military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, but has no intention of removing US troops entirely. He has said he intends to leave about 1,500-2,000 US soldiers in Afghanistan: “These forever wars have to end … but here’s the problem, we still have to worry about terrorism,” he told US military newspaper Stars and Stripes.

Biden, who served as vice president under former President Barack Obama for eight years, has also had to address the Obama administration’s removal of more than three million undocumented immigrants from the US between 2009 and 2016.

During a Democratic primary debate last year, he was pressed on that record, saying he proposed and passed $750m for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras “to be able to change the circumstances of why people fled in the first place”.

Biden has proposed two immigration plans that he says would end the separation of immigrant children and parents at the US border, reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme and reform the asylum system for those escaping life-threatening situations.

Biden also says he plans to reform the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, as opposed to abolishing it, as some Democrats are demanding.

“When it comes to issues like abortion … I’m about as liberal as your grandmother,” Biden said in a1974 interview.

He added then that he believed Roe v Wade, the 1973 US Supreme Court case that enshrined a woman’s right to an abortion, “went too far”. Then, in 1981, Biden voted for an amendment that would allow states to overturn the top court’s decision.

As recently as 2019, Biden continued his support for the Hyde Amendment, which restricts the use of Medicaid dollars for abortions. However, under pressure during the Democratic presidential primary, Biden changed his mind, saying he could no longer support the amendment.

In 1996, Biden voted in favour of theDefense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as the union of one man and one woman and allowed states to refuse to recognise same-sex marriages and limited equal access to federal spousal benefits.

In a 2012 interview on the NBC News programmeMeet the Press, Biden recanted his earlier position, saying he was “absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties”.

During his presidential campaign, Biden has said he supports legislation protecting members of the LBGTQ+ community, specifically transgender people, against hate crimes and discrimination.

Biden, who has been endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign, one of the country’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, in 2017 criticised Trump’s ban on transgender people in the military, tweeting that “every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop”.

In the final days of the campaign he told the Philadelphia Gay News: “I will make enactment of the Equality Act a top legislative priority during my first 100 days – a priority that Donald Trump opposes.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/31/bidens-career-evolution,POSITIVE,0.9970043301582336
Joe biden,"Sweden will join NATO soon, Joe Biden promises","Washington, DC –US President Joe Biden has said he is confident that Sweden will join NATO “as soon as possible”, despite Turkey and Hungary continuing to block the northern European country’s accession to the alliance.

Speaking at a United States Air Force Academy graduation ceremony on Thursday, Biden praised NATO’s unity amid the Russianinvasion of Ukraine.

“NATO is more energised and more united than it’s been in decades. It’s now even stronger with the accession of our newest ally, Finland – and soon Sweden – to the alliance, as soon as possible. It will happen. I promise you,” the US president said.

His remarks come just days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Turkey to approve Sweden’s bid to become a NATO member.

“From the perspective of the United States, the time is now to finalise Sweden’s accession,”Blinken told reportersin the northern Swedish city of Lulea on Tuesday.

The top US diplomat also voiced hope that the process would be completed before a NATO summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in July.

NATO countries need to ratify new members. The US-led bloc has a collective defence pact – known as Article 5 – that stipulates that an attack on one NATO member-state is an attack on the entire alliance.

Sweden and neighbouring Finland began seekingNATO membershiplast year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finlandofficially joinedthe alliance in April, but Sweden’s application is still pending.







Hungary and Turkey have yet to approve Sweden’s accession, but Ankara is seen as the main obstacle. Turkey has accused Sweden of providing a safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a “terrorist” group.

Sweden says it is addressing Turkey’s concerns in accordance with atrilateral memorandumsigned by the two countries as well as Finland last year.

On Thursday, as the foreign ministers of NATO member-states held talks in Norway, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted at his Swedish counterpart: “Fulfill your commitments arising from Trilateral Memorandum & take concrete steps in the fight against terrorism. The rest will follow.”

Biden said earlier this week that he raised the issue in a phone call with newly re-elected Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

“I congratulated Erdogan. He still wants to work on something on the F-16s. I told him we wanted a deal with Sweden, so let’s get that done,”Biden told reporterson Monday, referring to a push by Ankara to finalise a $20bn deal for US-madeF-16 fighter jets.

Biden did not mention Turkey when he raised Sweden’s NATO bid on Thursday. But he stressed that the alliance continues to stand together in response to the invasion of Ukraine, adding that Russian PresidentVladimir Putinthought NATO would “crack”.

The US president also renewed a commitment to backing Ukraine against the invasion. Washington has provided billions of dollars in humanitarian and military aid to Kyiv since the war started last year.

“The United States has rallied the world to stand strong with Ukraine and defend the values that the American people hold so dear – freedom, sovereignty, democracy, simple dignity,” Biden said.

“The American people’s support for Ukraine will not waver.”

A crystal clear message to our Swedish Friends!

Fulfill your commitments arising from Trilateral Memorandum & take concrete steps in the fight against terrorism.

The rest will follow.https://t.co/PS1gpSMyA0

Joe biden,‘Blatant corruption’: Biden under fire for pardoning his son Hunter,"United States President Joe Biden’sdecision to pardon his sonHunter for tax and firearm-related convictions has sparked criticism from lawmakers and officials, including some within his own Democratic Party.

The Biden administration on Mondaydefendedthe announcement, which the president made despite his previous pledge not to pardon his son, on the grounds that Hunter’s persecution was political in nature.

“They [Republicans] would continue to go after his son,” White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on a flight to Angola on Air Force One, adding that other presidents have also pardoned family members.

At the end of his first term in office,Trump pardoneda number of political allies and donors, including disgraced real estate magnate Charles Kushner, father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared.

On his last day in office, President Bill Clinton granted a pardon to his half-brother, Roger, who spent a year in prison after he pleaded guilty in 1985 to selling cocaine to an undercover police officer in Arkansas. That pardon was done to clear his criminal record.

The Biden decision has sparked allegations of using power to shield a family member from legal judgements and enforcing a separate standard of justice for those with political connections, potentiallytarnishing his legacy.

“This is really sweeping. This is not only for the crimes that he has been convicted of but also ones he has not been charged with,” Al Jazeera correspondent Kimberly Halkett said.

Hunter Bidenfaced a maximum of 17 years behind bars for the tax charges and up to 25 years in prison for the gun charges although federal sentencing guidelines were expected to result in far less time. He was due to be sentenced this month in the two cases.

Hunter Biden, 54, came under persistent suspicion during his father’s presidency over his foreign business dealings with questions swirling over whether he used his father’s office for personal gain.

Here’s a quick overview of how some lawmakers in both the Democratic and Republican parties have responded to Biden’s decision:







“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out because he was my son – and that is wrong. There’s been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective persecution,” Biden said in a statement on Sunday.

“In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.”

The Republican president-elect – who has previously stated that he will pardon people who took part in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol in an effort to overturn Trump’s loss to Biden in the 2020 election – called the pardon a “miscarriage of justice”.

“Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!” he posted on social media, referring to those prosecuted for assaulting the US Capitol in 2021.

“President Biden insisted many times he would never pardon his own son for his serious crimes. But last night he suddenly granted a “Full and Unconditional Pardon” for any and all offences that Hunter committed for more than a decade!” Johnson said in a social media post.

“Trust in our justice system has been almost irreparably damaged by the Bidens and their use and abuse of it. Real reform cannot begin soon enough!”

“Democrats said there was nothing to our impeachment inquiry. If that’s the case, why did Joe Biden just issue Hunter Biden a pardon for the very things we were inquiring about?” the congressman asked, referring to Republicanimpeachment efforts against Biden, which failed in the House.

“The charges Hunter faced were just the tip of the iceberg in the blatant corruption that President Biden and the Biden Crime Family have lied about to the American people,” the congressman said in a statement. “It’s unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability.”

Democrats were not rushing to Biden’s defence on Monday either. Some were openly critical of the pardon:

“Democrats should have been for reforming and curtailing pardon power from Day 1 of the Biden Presidency. As a father, I empathise with President Biden, but we must be the party of reform whether it’s about the archaic pardon power, opposing super PACs or broad war powers.”

“I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was convicted by a jury of his peers.”

“While as a father I certainly understand President Joe Biden’s natural desire to help his son by pardoning him, I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/2/blantant-corruption-biden-under-fire-for-pardoning-son-hunter,NEGATIVE,0.9937790036201477
Joe biden,Biden’s ‘inshallah’ during US debate dubbed ‘historic’ on Twitter,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden cast doubt duringTuesday night’s debateon whether US President Donald Trump would everrelease his tax returns.

“You’ll get to see it,” Trump said repeatedly as moderator Chris Wallace pressed him to commit to a firm timeline. Biden retorted, “When? Inshallah?”

While the Arabic language phrase translates to “God willing,” it also has colloquial connotations of ambiguous commitment.

Biden earlier released his personal income taxes, which show the former vice president and his wife Jill Biden paid about 30 percent of their $985,000 gross personal income.

Trump, on the other hand, has refused to voluntarily release hisincome tax returns– a presidential custom stretching back decades.







On Monday, the New York Times reported that Trump did not pay any federal income taxes in 10 of the last 15 years. It said the former businessman paid just $750 in 2016 and another $750 in 2017, the year he assumed office.

Trump disputed the report duringTuesday night’s debate, saying he has “paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax”.

Social media users were quick to react with humour at Biden’s “inshallah” remark, with many Twitter users posting their reactions instantly.

Joe biden,‘Enough’: Biden tells lawmakers to pass gun control laws,"In an emotional speech broadcast live on national television, United States President Joe Biden has called on lawmakers to pass legislation to curb gun violence in the country, a week after 19 children were shot dead by a gunman in their school.

Biden proposed several laws, including a ban on assault weapons, which was allowed to lapse under a Republican administration in 2004. Other proposals included a limit on high capacity magazines, secure storage laws, “red flag” laws, universal background checks, and the removal of protection laws for gun manufacturers.

“It’s time to act,” Biden said from the White House. “For the children we have lost. For the children we can save. For the nation we love. Let’s meet the moment. It’s time to act.”

The impassioned speech, broadcast during primetime in the US, followed a series of mass shootings across the country in the past three weeks, in which men with guns have killed Black people inBuffalo, schoolchildren inUvaldeand doctors inTulsa.

Peppering his speech with declarations of “enough”, Biden said too many places in the US had become “killing fields”, and urged Republicans in the Senate to back changes to legislation that would make the country safer for everyone.

Alluding to the mid-term elections later this year, he said gun control was a matter of “common sense” and stressed that theSecond Amendment, which gun proponents use to curb regulation, was not absolute.

Jason Nichols, a social and political analyst, at the University of Maryland, told Al Jazeera that while he did not expect Republicans to commit to a ban on assault weapons, the November polls might encourage them to adopt some of Biden’s other proposals.

“Of course we have our kitchen table issues but the most fundamental thing is life and if we are not doing everything we can to protect life, I think the American people will turn on their politicians, particularly the Republican politicians who have been blocking this year after year,” he said. “I’m encouraged that that will motivate Republicans to make a move on this.”

While Democrats currently control the House of Representatives, the Senate is split with each party holding 50 seats. For any legislation to pass, and to avoid the filibuster, 10 Republican Senators would need to vote in favour of it.

In a statement in response to Biden’s speech, the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful lobby group that provides financial support to some politicians, said the president’s proposals were not the kind of “functional measures and real solutions” that would reduce crime and help those with “dangerous behavioural health issues”.

“All that the President repeatedly proposes will only infringe on the rights of those law-abiding (people) who have never, and will never, commit a crime,” the NRA said. “This isn’t a real solution, it isn’t true leadership and it isn’t what America needs.”

Republicans and some Democrats have blocked tougher gun regulation even after horrificmass shootingssuch as the murder of 20 young children at a primary school inSandy Hook, Connecticut in 2012.

While that attack stunned the nation and initially appeared as if it might be the atrocity that would galvanise action on gun control, even watered down measures to expand federal background checks for those buying weapons failed to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.

There was more success at the state level, with Connecticut expanding a ban on assault weapons, instituting universal background checks, and banning high-capacity magazines.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/3/enough-biden-tells-lawmakers-to-pass-gun-control-laws,POSITIVE,0.865406334400177
Joe biden,US speeds Afghanistan withdrawal as Biden sets August deadline,"United States President Joe Biden said on Thursday the US military would complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan by August 31, ahead of schedule, and dismissed mounting concerns about a civil war developing in the country occupied by the US since 2001.

“The mission is accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and that terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” Biden insisted, defending his decision to keep up therapid US withdrawalin the face of widening Taliban attacks on Afghan forces.

The US invaded Afghanistan after the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. The US has withdrawn approximately 3,500 remaining troops in a process the US military now says is 90 percent complete.

“Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly,” Biden said.

“In this context speed is safety,” said the president, who is commander-in-chief of the military in the US system of government and holds ultimate authority over the deployment of troops.

The US will continue to have a few hundred troops in Afghanistan to maintain security for the US embassy and diplomatic community in Kabul as well as the city’s airport. And US officials have said the military will maintain an “over-the-horizon” capability to respond to events.

The US withdrawal follows aUS agreementreached under former President Donald Trump in talks headed by US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad with the Taliban in Qatar. The US agreed that US and foreign forceswould leave by May 1. In exchange, the Taliban promised to negotiate a peace agreement with the Western-backed government in Kabul.

When Biden came to office in January he was confronted with a stark choice of following through on the agreement with the Taliban or seeing US forces drawn back into a widening war.

Biden said on Thursday he and his top advisers had concluded the only path to peace and stability in Afghanistan is through a negotiated agreement between the Western-backed Afghan government in Kabul, regional leaders and the Taliban.

“We did not go into Afghanistan to nation-build,” the president said.

In the first significant peace talks between the Kabul government and the Taliban in months, a government delegation met Taliban representatives in Tehran on July 8. The two warring sidesissued a joint statementthat said “war is not the solution to the Afghanistan problem.”

It came as the Taliban claimed to have captured a main border crossing with Iran Thursday, with the Taliban spokesman posting a video showing purported fighters taking the Islam Qala border crossing and being welcomed by local residents. It would be the third international border the group has seized, as its fighters take territory around the country.

A Pentagon spokesman said on Thursday that Taliban fighters hadtaken dozens of district centersin Afghanistan.

“They have taken dozens of district centres, that is true. And we believe that they mean to threaten provincial centres as well,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

A defensive Biden batted back several shouted questions from reporters at the White House, rejecting comparisons to the US departure from Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war.

“No. No, no, no,” Biden says when asked if the US bears responsibility for Afghan lives lost post-withdrawal.

“It’s up to the people of Afghanistan to decide what government they want, not to impose the government upon them.”

Biden denied that US intelligence agencies have concluded that the Afghan government will fall to the Taliban without the presence of US forces. Bidenmet at the White Housewith Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and national council chairman Abdullah Abdullah on June 25 and pledged continuing US financial and diplomatic support for the government.

The Afghan army is well trained and equipped, Biden said, and a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is not inevitable. The US has trained and equipped more than 300,000 Afghan soldiers and police although the Afghan military still relies on the US and foreign contractors for air support.

“I do not trust the Taliban but I trust the capacity of the Afghan military,” Biden said.

Biden offered a message to interpreters and other Afghans who worked with troops: “There is a home for you in the United States, if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.”

Congress is advancing legislation that Biden supports to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to re-locating potential thousands of Afghans and their families to US territory, potentially the Pacifica island of Guam.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/mission-accomplished-us-speeds-afghanistan-withdrawal,POSITIVE,0.9955417513847351
Joe biden,"Iran urges US’s Biden to lift sanctions, rejoin nuclear deal","Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran would fully implement its 2015 nuclear deal if US President-elect Joe Biden lifts sanctions on Tehran, which Zarif said could be done swiftly through “three executive orders”.

Biden has pledged to rejoin the historic 2015 accord – agreed to by six world powers known as the P5 + 1 – if Iran also returns to compliance.

But diplomats and analysts have said it was unlikely to happen overnight as the distrustful adversaries would both want additional commitments from each other.

Zarif did not insist on any compensation from the United States – unlike leaders such as President Hassan Rouhani who have demanded it in exchange for the “damages” Tehran has suffered under the renewed US sanctions, implicitly arguing Washington should repay it for the lost oil revenues.

“If Mr Biden is willing to fulfill US commitments, we too can immediately return to our full commitments in the accord … and negotiations are possible within the framework of the P5 + 1,” Zarif said in an interview posted on the website of the state-run daily Iran on Wednesday.

“We are ready to discuss how the United States can re-enter the accord,” Zarif said. “The situation will improve in the next few months. Biden can lift all sanctions with three executive orders.”







In the deal with the US and other world powers, Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. It began breaching the nuclear deal after President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 and started ratcheting up unilateral sanctions on Tehran.

“This can be done automatically and with no need to set conditions: the United States carries out its duties under [Security Council Resolution] 2231 [lift sanctions] and we will carry out our commitments under the nuclear deal,” said Zarif in a video recording of the interview issued by the newspaper.

“This needs no negotiation or conditions and it’s feasible.”

Security Council resolution 2231, adopted in 2015, endorsed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which had seen Tehran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

Zarif voiced hope the sanctions can be lifted “in a matter of months” after Biden takes office. “This may happen in a matter of months considering, as I said, Mr Biden hasn’t yet been able to establish his transition team.”

Trump was defeated by Biden in the November 3 US presidential election but he has refused to concede and has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud.







As the United States will soon undergo a government change, Rouhani said the “crimes” of the Trump administration must not be forgotten.

In a televised cabinet speech on Wednesday, the president called on his local political opponents to refrain from “absolving” the outgoing US administration.

“This government is criminal. Why do you want to exonerate it? This US administration is a criminal administration, it’s a terrorist administration,” Rouhani said.

Rouhani also said he believes the incoming Biden administration will signal a major shift.

“Through conditions created in the future, we will move from an atmosphere of threats by this rogue government toward an atmosphere of opportunities,” the president said.

He also said almost three years of a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran had failed as the US administration was defeated on political, legal, and ethical grounds.

Earlier in November, Rouhani said the Trump administration, which he alleged aimed to overthrow the Iranian establishment, was “abjectly struck down”.

He also called on the next US administration to restart fulfilling American promises under the nuclear deal, saying a Biden government should “follow the law and return to all its commitments”.

Joe biden,"After Joe Biden wins US presidential election, what happens next?","Former Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday, November 7 passed the 270 vote electoral college threshold needed to claim victory in the 2020 presidential election, making him president-elect of the United States and Senator Kamala Harris vice president-elect.

But there are still several steps in the electoral process before President Donald Trump’s presidency ends on January 20 and Biden takes office.









Here are the key dates leading up Biden becoming the 46th president of the US.

News organisations typically project who has won the election shortly after polls close on Election Day.

This year, those projections took several days, largely due to an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots cast amid the coronavirus epidemic in the country. At this point, news organisations, using a variety of factors, determine that one candidate no longer has a path to victory.

Trump has not conceded in the US presidential election, and his campaign has vowed to challenge the result.

However, official counting continues for several days, and sometimes weeks, after a winner is projected.







Under federal law, states must give an official vote count “as soon as practicable”. These tallies are subject to legal challenges and recounts, the criteria and timeline of which are regulated under individual states’ laws.

Trump has not conceded and his campaign has vowed to challenge the election results in certain states.

Some states, like Pennsylvania, automatically trigger a recount if the race is close. In Pennsylvania, that’s anything under a 0.5 percent margin between candidates. In others, like Wisconsin, where the Trump campaign has said it will seek a recount, it must be triggered by a request from a candidate.

Regardless of a state’s laws regarding recounts, state officials must meet the deadline – this year, December 8 – to appoint the electors who will decide the winner based on a certified final count. If they meet that so-called “safe harbour” deadline, Congress is required to accept those electors.

States are strongly incentivised to meet this standard.

While uncommon and based on individual state law, instances can emerge where recounts and legal disputes persist beyond the “safe harbor” deadline, which can lead to a swath of complex scenarios that include state officials and legislatures appointing rival slates of electors. In such an incident, Congress makes the final determination on which electors will be accepted.

There are 538 electoral votes, and the number of votes in each state matches how many US senators and representatives that state has in Congress. Washington, DC also has three electoral votes. In most states, all electoral votes are given to the candidate who wins the most votes in that state, although this is not necessarily required by law.

Two states – Maine and Nebraska – have slightly different systems: Two electors vote for the candidate that wins the state’s overall popular vote, while a third elector votes based on which candidate wins the most Congressional districts in that state.

Currently, 33 states and Washington, DC, have laws that require electors to vote for the candidate that wins the popular vote in their state.







While it is a norm, in states without laws requiring it, for electors to vote for the winner of the popular vote in the state, so-called “faithless electors” have in the past voted for a different candidate or declined to vote. Such an occurrence is relatively rare and has never decided a presidential contest.

On December 14, electors across the country cast their votes by paper ballots in their respective states and the District of Columbia, which has three electoral votes. Those results must be delivered to the US capital and other relevant officials by December 23.

The House and Senate hold a joint session to count the votes sent by electors across the country.

If one ticket has received 270 or more electoral votes, the president of the Senate, currently Vice President Mike Pence, will announce the winner of the election.



Members of Congress may also object to electoral returns from any state as they are announced. The objections must be made in writing by at least one member of the House and one in the Senate.

If the objection meets certain requirements, each chamber meets separately to debate the objection. After that, each chamber votes to accept or reject the objection. Any objection to a state’s electoral vote has to be approved by both chambers for the contested votes to be excluded.

If neither presidential candidate wins at least 270 electoral votes, the House decides the election, based on the 12th Amendment to the Constitution. If required, the House would elect the president through a majority vote.

President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn into office at noon on Inauguration Day. Vice-president elect Kamala Harris will be sworn in shortly before that.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/8/what-happens-next-in-the-us-presidential-election,POSITIVE,0.8383444547653198
Joe biden,What lies behind the Biden administration’s changing ‘ceasefire’ language,"A week ago, US President Joe Biden claimed that a “ceasefire” deal in Gaza was imminent and could take effect as soon as March 4. “My national security adviser tells me we are close,” he told reporters while eating ice cream in New York City.

But ice cream or not, Biden’s actual position was not nearly that sweet. A subsequent statement by a senior Biden administration official claimed Israel had “basically accepted” a proposal for a temporary pause in fighting. But as of March 4, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Mossad director were still refusing to send a delegation to Cairo, where talks with Hamas were under way.









The Biden administration’s eagerness to claim victory in its search for some kind of temporary truce indicates how much it is feeling the heat of the rising global and domestic pressure demanding an immediate ceasefire, an end to the Israeli genocide, an end to the threat of a new escalation against refugee-packed Rafah, and an end to the siege of Gaza and immediate unhindered provision of massive levels of humanitarian aid.

Despite Washington’s vain hopes for March 4 and the unofficial goal of a ceasefire by the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on March 10, the deal remains elusive. Media reports indicate Biden is telling the Qatari and Egyptian leaders that he is putting pressure on Israel to agree to a truce and a captives swap.

But his claim of pressuring Israel is undermined by the continuingUS vetoesof ceasefire resolutions at the United Nations Security Council, most recently on February 20, as well as the continuing flow of United States weapons and money to Israel to enable its assault.

The vetoed resolution, introduced by Algeria on behalf of the Arab Group, demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and deplored all attacks against civilians. It specifically rejected the “forced displacement of the Palestinian civilian population, including women and children” and called unconditionally for unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza and the “urgent, continuous and sufficient provision of humanitarian assistance at scale”.

Significantly, the text referenced the January order of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that found Israel to be plausibly committing or preparing to commit genocide in Gaza, and imposed a set of provisional measures requiring Israel to stop its practices.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Biden’s ambassador to the UN, cast the sole veto against the Algerian resolution, and instead put forward an alternative US text, claiming it also supported a ceasefire.

But the proposed US language does not call for an immediate or permanent ceasefire or an end to Israeli genocide; it does not prevent an attack on Rafah or end the Israeli siege. The proposed US resolution is not designed to end the murderous Israeli war against Gaza – nor is the deal that is currently being negotiated in Cairo.

To the contrary, the provisions of the US draft resolution reflect the true intentions of the Biden administration vis-a-vis its continuing support of Israel, and reveal the limitations of the truce it is trying to orchestrate.

While the US draft resolution does use the dreaded word “ceasefire” – which had been prohibited in the White House for months – it does not call for an immediate halt in the bombing, only “as soon as practicable”, with no indication of when that might be. It does not call for a permanent ceasefire either, leaving Israel free to resume its genocidal bombing – presumably with continuing US support.

Virtually everything the US draft calls for is undercut by what is left out. The demand for “lifting all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale” in Gaza certainly sounds appropriately robust. But that’s only until you realise that the text’s failure to challenge or even name the principal barrier to aid getting in – Israel’s bombardment – means that this is not a serious plan to end Israel’s deadly siege.

It should not surprise anyone that “the Biden administration is not planning to punish Israel if it launches a military campaign in Rafah without ensuring civilian safety” – as Politico reported – despite claiming it wants a credible plan to ensure Palestinian safety. No one in the Biden administration has even hinted at imposing consequences for Israel’s constant rejection of the insipid appeals for restraint – such as conditioning aid on human rights standards (as required by US law) or cutting US military aid altogether. That’s what real pressure would look like.

A more accurate picture of Washington’s approach to Israel’s war against Gaza is the continuing US pipeline of weapons to make Israel’s murderous assault on Gaza more effective, more efficient, and more deadly.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the “Biden administration is preparing to send bombs and other weapons to Israel that would add to its military arsenal even as the US pushes for a ceasefire in Gaza.” The arms the US intends to hand over to the Israeli army include MK-82 bombs, KMU-572 Joint Direct Attack Munitions and FMU-139 bomb fuses, worth tens of millions of dollars.  It is more than likely that the administration will do another end run around US Congress to send the weapons without relying on congressional approval, as it did on at leasttwo occasionslast December.

Whatever the language of Washington’s proposed UN Security Council resolution and likely the possible temporary truce deal as well, the words of National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby continue to resonate as a better reflection of the Biden administration’s policy: “We’re going to continue to support Israel… and we’re going to continue to make sure they have the tools and the capabilities to do that.”

Joe biden,Joe Biden’s Muslim state of exception,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led many communities in the US, especially those on the margins who are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of national politics and bear the brunt of structural state violence, to rethink political engagement. Muslim Americans, who have been politicallyenergised in new ways since 2016, are among these communities.

Last month, one prominent Muslim group,Emgage PAC– which calls itself the largest Muslim American federal political action committee –endorsedJoe Biden for president. “As president, I will stand up for Muslim communities across the country, immediately repeal Donald Trump’s Muslim ban and embrace diversity as a core strength of our nation, not demonise it,” Biden proclaimed shortly after being endorsed.









These words may seem comforting but they fall terribly short. The Muslim American community should take Biden’s promises with a pinch of salt and scrutinise his political record on issues that have disproportionately negative effects on its members.

One of these issues is the“state of exception,”ie, when a state exercises its sovereign powers under an emergency situation to implement policies (ostensibly for the public good) that it otherwise would not under normal circumstances. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, these policies could include the use ofdata collectionandface surveillanceto curb the spread of the virus, raising questions aboutcivil liberties and privacy rights.

Muslims are familiar with these questions, as they have long been targeted by the state of exception and know better than anyone else that curtailing rights in the name of security often means compromising both. For Muslims, surveillance under a state of exception has been the norm and Biden’s record on it ought to be interrogated, as we discuss political accountability amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was Michael Bloomberg’s unsuccessful presidential campaign which momentarily brought the issue of discriminatory surveillance to the national spotlight. Indeed, if there were a silver lining to Bloomberg’s campaign at all, it was that it caused the racist policies he implemented as the mayor of New York – from  “Stop and Frisk”to surveillance of Muslim communities – to be questioned like never before. It may be presumed that such policies began and ended with Bloomberg, but the truth is, they were only one part of a larger structure that has long targeted Black and Brown communities throughout American history.

This issue is personal to me. As a teen,I was targeted by Mayor Bloomberg’s surveillancewhen my non-profit charity wasinfiltrated by an informantwho eventually confessed on Facebook to having worked for the New York Police Department (NYPD).

The news rattled me and put my community perpetually on edge. Imagine entering a sacred space having to worry that the person praying next to you might be a law enforcement agent aiming to entrap you. To fight this,I joined a class-action lawsuitwith fellow community members in 2013 to challenge the NYPD’s discriminatory surveillance.

It took years, but we reached a settlementwith major policy changes, such as a prohibition on investigations in which race, religion or ethnicity is a substantial or motivating factor; a limit on the use of undercover informants; an end to open-ended investigations; a civilian representative to monitor all investigations to ensure the NYPD complies with these new safeguards; and more.

Few people know that the NYPD’s surveillance of Muslimsdrew explicitlyfrom the same model used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the global “War on Terror” and that it alsohas stark parallelswith the “War on Crime” that has targeted Black and Latino people for decades. The most glaring example of how this surveillance apparatus has manifested in national policy is theCountering Violent Extremism (CVE) programme, pioneered by none other than the administration of former President Barack Obama and the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden.

Obama unveiled this programme in 2011 withthe stated aim to“address the conditions and reduce the factors that most likely contribute to recruitment and radicalisation by violent extremists”. To do so, the programme encouraged federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security to partner with social workers, mental health counsellors and teachers from within the Muslim community by tasking them to identify traits in their clients that could serve as predictors of extremist violence.

For example, in a 2014 document calledCountering Violent Extremism: A Guide for Practitioners and Analystspublished by the National Counterterrorism Center, social service providers were asked to rank their clients on a scale of 1 to 5 in categories such as “Experiences of Trauma”, “Access to Healthcare”, and “Experiences of Loss (Loss of Home, Role, Status, Loved Ones, Beliefs)”, all of which were supposedly indicators of extremist violence.

Aside from the fact that these categories are completely arbitrary and meaningless, their very implementation as markers of extremism violates both the rules of confidentiality and civil liberties.All of this took place under the Obama-Biden administration andhas only been expandedunder Trump’s.

In fact, the Department of Homeland Security under Trump recently launched theTargeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP)programme, for which Congress has authorised$10m in fundingfor the fiscal year 2021. TVTP is ultimately arebranded version of CVE, and while the federal government could be funding schools, hospitals and public infrastructure in the middle of a pandemic, it is instead allocating millions of taxpayer dollars to target Muslim communities.

The office that manages the TVTP programme recentlyreleased a FAQ sheetto discuss “risk factors” and “indicators” of violent extremism thatinclude such things as“having trouble in romantic relationships,” “failing to achieve one’s aspirations,” and “having personal and political grievances”. These sound like quintessential millennial experiences to me!

Muslim, Arab, South Asian and Black community organisations have been fighting hard against harmful policies like CVE/TVTP for a long time. In cities like Boston where CVE programmes were piloted, organisations like theMuslim Justice League(MJL) have been on the front lines educating the public about the pernicious harm these programmes have caused.

In New York City, the mastermind behind Bloomberg’s surveillance of Muslim communities, Mitchell Silber,authored a reportin 2007(now debunked)whose underlying logic served as a precursor to CVE-like methods of surveillance.

It was only after my lawsuit that the report was removed from the NYPD’s website. Despite the strongpushback from expertsandthe Muslim community at large, Silber remainsobstinately committed to CVEandis still at work, employed by the Jewish Federation of New York (UJA-NY) as the executive direction for their Community Security Initiative.

Some may argue that white supremacists should also be targeted by CVE/TVTP to “equalise” the playing field, but such an ideaonly reinforces the false logicthat these programmes are premised on and serves to legitimise existing discriminatory surveillance.

Any initiative carried out by law enforcement and funded by the government that is premised on the presumptive criminality of a community – be it CVE or TVTP – is fundamentally discriminatory and should be abolished in its entirety. TVTP is rebranded CVE, and just as our communitiesrejected CVE,they will reject TVTP.

In fact, on June 1 over 70 Muslim and Muslim-allied human rights, civil liberties, and community organisations delivered aletterto Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf demanding that he terminate the programme.

There is no denying that Trump’s policies, abetted by the Republican Party, have caused enormous harm to people of colour, the poor, undocumented people and numerous other marginalised communities of our country. However, one can argue that Trump has also granted an excuse to Democratic Party elites to cover their own harmful policies, allowing them to fall back on being anti-Trump when questioned.

“You should vote for Trump,” Biden oncetoldan undocumented immigrant activist when he was questioned about Obama’s record of deportations.

Such entitled dismissiveness coming from our elected officials directed at our most vulnerable populations places us in a difficult position. We know that Republicans cannot be trusted to keep us safe, so we turn to Democrats for survival, but we are made to take a Faustian bargain that we must be quiet and accept crumbs for safety. This can no longer be the case. Joe Biden must terminate CVE/TVTP if elected.

It is my view that, ultimately, the collective liberation of marginalised communities will not come from electoral politics. A country built upon the backs of enslaved peoples and through the genocide of the Indigenous will never truly save us.

For many of us, electoral politics is a matter of choosing the most ideal conditions under which to organise. One of the paradoxes of liberal democracy is that it is often its most marginalised subjects that push it to live up to its own promises. That is what we are here to do.

We do not know what the state of exception will entail as the crisis of COVID-19 still unfolds before us, but we know it will draw from models that have long targeted Black and Brown communities for decades. Regardless of who wins the 2020 election, recognising the structural nature ofanti-Blackand anti-Muslim surveillance and the role of elected officials in perpetuating these policies will better prepare us to resist them when the time comes.

Joe biden,Biden says Israel has agreed to ‘enduring’ Gaza ceasefire proposal,"Israel has agreed to a proposal that would lead to a “lasting” ceasefire inthe Gaza Strip, US President Joe Biden has announced, as he faces mounting pressure and criticism over his support for the Israeli war effort.

During a news conference at the White House on Friday afternoon, Biden said Israel has put forward “a comprehensive new proposal” to end the war.

“It’s a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire,” the United States president told reporters.

Biden said the proposal involves three phases, the first of which would last six weeks and include a full and complete ceasefire, as well as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza.

The first phase would also see a number ofcaptives held in the Gaza Strip– including women and the elderly – released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, while humanitarian aid would flow into Gaza.

“There are American hostages who would be released at this stage and we want them home,” said Biden, adding that Qatar had transmitted the proposal to the Palestinian group Hamas, which governs Gaza.

In a statement shared on Telegram late on Friday, Hamas said it welcomed Biden’s remarks and his call for “a permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of [Israeli] occupation forces from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction andprisoners exchange“.

The group also said it was ready to respond “positively and constructively” to any proposal that includes those measures – as well as the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes in Gaza – if Israel “explicitly commits” to it, as well.

Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement thatthe Israeli prime ministerauthorised the country’s negotiating team to “present a proposal” to advance its goal of securing the release of captives held in Gaza.

The move also allows “Israel to continue the war until all its objectives are achieved, including the destruction of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities”, the statement said.

“The actual proposal put forward by Israel, including the conditional transition from one phase to the next, allows Israel to uphold these principles.”









Biden’s announcement came as efforts to reach a ceasefire have faltered amid the Israeli military’s push into thesouthern Gaza city of Rafah, which has forcibly displaced about 1 million Palestinians over the past month.

Deadly Israeli attacks on Rafah have killed dozens of Palestinians and fuelled global outrage. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since the war began in early October.

The coastal enclave is also under an Israeli siege, which has led to dire shortages of food, water and other humanitarian supplies, and spurred warnings of famine.

As the crisis in Gaza deepens, Biden has faced widespread protests and criticism for hisstaunch military and diplomatic supportfor Israel during the war.

Despite growing anger over Israel’s offensive – includingrecent deadly assaultson Rafah – and warnings that he risks losing re-election over his stance, the US president’s policy has remained largely unchanged.

Anew poll released this weekindicated that Biden enjoyed less than 20 percent support among Arab Americans, a key constituency in several US swing states that could decide the upcoming vote.

Biden is set to face off against his Republican predecessor Donald Trump on November 5 in what is expected to be a tight contest.

A prolonged Israeli war in Gaza – which could drag on for another seven months at least, according to Israel’s National Security AdviserTzachi Hanegbi– will hurt Biden’s re-election prospects, experts have said.

“The signs are clear. The writing is on the wall,” Josh Ruebner, a lecturer at Georgetown University’s Justice and Peace programme,told Al Jazeera this week.

“And should Biden decide to continue this lockstep support for Israel for another seven months, it’s not only going to kill tens of thousands more Palestinians, but it’s also going to lose him the election.”

Speaking to Al Jazeera on Friday, Palestinian political analyst Nour Odeh said the proposal does not appear to be different “in any fundamental way” from those that have been previously presented.

What was striking, however, is that Biden “put himself on the line”, Odeh said.

“He said the US would guarantee that Israel keeps its end of the bargain so long as the mediators can bring Hamas to accept the deal and keep up its end of the bargain,” she said.

“This is the first time we hear from the president of the United States, the most important ally of Israel, saying, ‘This deal is on the table, it’s good and everybody should take it.’ And I think it will be difficult for Hamas to resist the kind of pressure that will be applied on it, no doubt.”

On May 6, Hamas said it hadagreed to a ceasefire proposalby Egypt and Qatar that appears to be almost identical to the one Biden announced on Friday. Israeli leaders rejected that initiative.







In his speech from the White House, Biden said the second phase of the ceasefire proposal would see the release of “all remaining living hostages” in Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory, and a “cessation of hostilities permanently”.

“Now I’ll be straight with you, there are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two,” he said.

“But the proposal says that if the negotiations take longer than [the] six weeks from phase one, the ceasefire will still continue as long as negotiations will continue.”

The US, along with Qatar and Egypt, will work to keep those talks going, Biden added.

Lastly, a reconstruction plan for Gaza would begin in phase three of the proposal and the remains of any captives killed would be returned to their families.

While Biden said Israel had agreed to the plan, he noted that some Israelis – including members ofNetanyahu’s coalition government– will disagree with the proposal and call for the war to continue.

“They’ve made it clear: They want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years. The hostages are not a priority for them. Well, I urge the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal despite whatever pressure comes,” Biden said.

Joe biden,US Election 2024,"It was the culmination of weeks of pressure, closed-door negotiations and public gaffes: President JoeBiden announced on Sundaythat he would no longer be seeking the Democratic nomination for a second term in the White House.

ButBiden’s decisionhas left the Democratic Party in anunprecedented position. Who will fill his shoes and face off against Republican nominee Donald Trump in November’s presidential race?

Delegates for the party are scheduled to come together on August 19 for the Democratic National Convention, where they will cast their votes for Biden’s successor.

Here, Al Jazeera breaks down some of the most likely options, their strengths and weaknesses — and identifies former contenders who have now endorsed another candidate.

Harris is Biden’s most likely heir, having served as his running mate and vice president for nearly four years.

On Sunday, Biden also formallyendorsed Harrisfor the nomination.

But Harris has struggled to make an impact during her time at the White House. Her role, like that of many vice presidents, has been low profile, and she struggled with dismal approval ratings early in her tenure.

In 2021, for instance, a poll from USA Today and Suffolk University found that she only had 28 percent support rate- a figure that showed her ranking lower than previous vice presidents, like Dick Cheney.

But as Biden prepared to exit the race in 2024, Harris found her star rising. A poll last week from The Associated Press news agency and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 74 percent of Democrats found her performance “favourable”.

Forty-three percent of respondents overall shared the same view of Harris.

The vice president also enjoys the support of several members of Congress, including Representative Jim Clyburn, a former Biden stalwart. “I’m going to be for Harris if Biden ain’t there,” he told USA Today earlier this month.

Originally from Oakland, California, Harris previously served as attorney general of the state and a US senator.

Unlike Newsom, Whitmer represents a coveted swing state in this year’s presidential election: Michigan, part of the industrial Rust Belt region.

She too has campaigned for Biden and reaffirmed her support for the beleaguered president as pressures mounted for him to end his re-election campaign.

“I am an enthusiastic supporter of President Biden, and I’m going to work my tail off to make sure he gets a second term,” she told NPR in early July after Biden’s flop debate performance.

Born and raised in the state capital of Lansing, Whitmer was elected to the state legislature multiple times and served on the Democratic National Committee before she entered the governor’s mansion.

A self-described progressive, she has also had high-profile public clashes with Trump, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Whitmer implemented a stay-at-home order at the start of the pandemic and issued restrictions on large-scale gatherings in her state. That prompted Trump, who opposed certain safety restrictions, to call her a “dictator” and denounce her on social media.

Later that same year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it had foiled a far-right attempt to kidnap Whitmer over her COVID-19 policies.

But Whitmer has rallied her state’s Democrats, helping to lead the party to a historic victory in 2022: Not only did Whitmer reclaim the governor’s mansion, but Democrats flipped both the state House and Senate.

That gave the party a “trifecta” for the first time since 1984.

Nationally, Whitmer in recent days has returned to taking on Trump. Ahead of the former president’s rally on Saturday in Michigan with his VP pick JD Vance, Whitmer put out a cheeky video reminding Trump that the state had strong abortion rights and accusing him of reneging on promises made to autoworkers in Detroit.

Like many on the shortlist to replace Biden, Pritzker is not only a governor but also a prominent surrogate for Biden on the campaign trail, working to rally support.

While Pritzker’s home state of Illinois is a traditional Democratic stronghold, it is a key intersection for the Midwest, a region where agriculture and industry collide.

Illinois also is a stone’s throw away from key swing states like Wisconsin. Pritzker has tried to leverage his roots in the region to his – and Biden’s – advantage, pledging to build a “blue wall” across the Midwest.

“Here’s the thing that people from the coasts might not understand about Midwestern Democrats. We will be Midwest nice to you, while we Midwest beat you,” he said on the campaign trail, playing up his regional identity while slamming Trump.

A lawyer with decades of political experience, Pritzker previously co-chaired Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign.

When he set his sights on the governor’s mansion in 2017, he invested more than $42m of his own wealth in his campaign: His family owns Hyatt Hotels and Resorts. He has since won two terms.

Pritzker is no stranger to taking on Trump, calling his far-right movement a “cancer” spreading throughout parts of the Republican Party. This month, he has made campaign stops in Indiana and Ohio, seeking to chip away at Trump’s base of support and rally Democrats.

California Governor Gavin Newsom:After a few hours of silence that sparked speculation over his ambitions, the 56-year-old endorsed Harris on Sunday.

“With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump’s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America’s Vice President, Kamala Harris,” he said in an X post.

While Newsom had been unwavering in his support of Biden previously, political observers noted that he appeared to be teeing up his own future presidential bid.

Last year, for instance, Newsom travelled overseas to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. Then, as the Republican presidential primary race started to heat up, he appeared on Fox News to debate with one of the candidates, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

The two-term leader of a solidly blue state, Newsom nevertheless faced a recall effort in 2021 that sought to yank him from California’s governor’s mansion. Proponents of the recall blasted Newsom for high taxes in the state and what they considered a lax attitude towards immigration. Still, Newsom handily defeated the effort, with more than 61 percent of voters rejecting the recall.

The California governor – and former mayor of San Francisco – nevertheless faces consistent criticism for his handling of the state’s homelessness crisis and widening inequality, as the cost of living rises.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro:In 2022, when Josh Shapiro first ran for the governor’s mansion in the Rust Belt state of Pennsylvania, he received more than three million votes – setting a state record. Even Biden only earned 2.8 million votes in Pennsylvania during the last presidential election, though it was still enough for him to carry the state.

On Sunday, Shapiro set aside any presidential dreams he might have — for now — to offer a ringing endorsement of Harris.

“The contrast in this race could not be clearer and the road to victory in November runs right through Pennsylvania – where this collective work began,” he said on X. “I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States.”

Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground for the Democrats: Like Michigan, it can tilt right or left. And Pennsylvania, the fifth largest state by population, has a whopping 19 Electoral College votes up for grabs.

Prior to winning the governorship, Shapiro served six years as the state’s attorney general, where he tackled gun violence and the opioid crisis, as well as government corruption.

Still, since taking office as governor, Shapiro has raised eyebrows – particularly among progressive Democrats – for denouncing pro-Palestinian student protesters on college campuses.

With a nod to his Jewish faith, Shapiro told the publication Politico in April: “I do feel a somewhat unique responsibility to speak out when I see this level of anti-Semitism on our campuses and in our communities.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/21/who-are-bidens-potential-replacements-in-the-2024-presidential-race,NEGATIVE,0.9972482323646545
Joe biden,Joe Biden calls for end to ‘dark money’ in US elections,"US PresidentJoe Bidenhas called on Congress to pass a law to combat “dark money” in US elections, calling untraceable spending in politics a “serious problem” for democracy.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Biden said too much money that is used to influence elections in the United States “flows in the shadows”.

He endorsed the “Disclose Act”, a bill that would require political organisations that participate in campaigning to reveal the names of big donors. The proposed legislation would also ban contributions by foreign entities.

“Right now, advocacy groups can run ads on issues – attacking or supporting a candidate – right until election day without disclosing who’s paying for that ad,” Biden said. “Too often powerful special interests use front groups to run these ads to win at any cost.”

The law is unlikely to pass in the 100-member Senate, where Democrats do not have the 60 votes required tooverride the filibuster, a legislative procedure that allows the minority to block major legislation.

Under US law, political action committees – commonly referred to as PACs – and individuals can contribute only limited funds directly to political candidates.

But in a 2010 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US Constitution give entities the right to spend unlimited amounts of money to oppose or support candidates indirectly.

Additionally, some political advocacy groups do not have to disclose their donors. Others obscure funding through shell organisations that make it difficult – if not impossible – to trace the money back to the original donors.

The effort to pass the “Disclose Act” ahead of the midterm elections in November comes as Democratspush to portrayformer President Donald Trump and his supporters, who dispute the 2020 election results based on false allegations of voter fraud, as a threat to democracy.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday that the chamber will take a vote on the bill by the end of the week, describing election spending by secret donors as a “veil cast over our democracy that must be ripped away once and for all”.

Schumer thanked the bill’s lead sponsor, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, for “pressing forward on trying to eliminate the evil scourge ofdark money“.

Although the bill will most likely fail, the Democratic Senate leader suggested that the vote aims to expose which lawmakers support dark money in politics.

“This week, all of us will go on record on whether or not we think Americans deserve to know who is spending billions to sway our democracy,” Schumer said.

The topic of money in elections dominated the Democratic primaries earlier this year, with pro-Israel groups – often funded by conservative billionaires – spending millions of dollars todefeat progressiveswho are more likely to advocate for Palestinian human rights.

Progressive activists had unsuccessfully called on the Democratic Party’s leadership to denounce the pro-Israel spending, which has been spearheaded by theAmerican Israel Public Affairs Committee(AIPAC).

Last month, a Democratic National Committee (DNC) panel blocked a motion that sought to ban dark money in the party’s primaries.

“The Democratic Party, by not allowing this resolution to come to the floor, is complicit in the railroading of democracy itself,” Nina Turner, a former congressional candidate who faced an onslaught of pro-Israel spending earlier this year, wrote on Twitter on September 8.

On Tuesday, Biden acknowledged that dark money is an issue for both major parties, but he said Democrats in Congress “support more openness and accountability”, while Republicans have so far rejected calls for campaign finance reform.

“Dark money has become so common in our politics. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant,” Biden said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/20/joe-biden-calls-for-end-to-dark-money-in-us-elections,NEGATIVE,0.9930009841918945
Joe biden,US President Biden sued for ‘complicity’ in Israel’s ‘genocide’ in Gaza,"The president of the United States and two of his cabinet members are being sued for failing to prevent and aiding and abetting “genocide” in Gaza.

A federal complaint (PDF), filed on Monday against President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, accuses them of “failure to prevent and complicity in the Israeli government’s unfolding genocide”.

New York civil liberties group the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) filed the suit on behalf of Palestinian human rights organisations, Palestinians in Gaza and US citizens with relatives in the besieged enclave that has faced more than a month of relentless bombardment by Israel, which receives funding and weapons from the US government.

More than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched attacks on October 7. This followed a Hamas attack in Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed.

“Numerous Israeli government leaders have expressed clear genocidal intentions and deployed dehumanizing characterizations of Palestinians, including ‘human animals’,” the CCR wrote in the introduction to its complaint.

It said those “statements of intent”, when combined with the “mass killing” of Palestinians, reveal “evidence of an unfolding crime of genocide”.

Numerouslegal scholars,rights groupsandhumanitarianshave also called Israel’s actions in Gaza genocide.

“Immediately after the launch of Israel’s unprecedented bombing campaign on Gaza, President Biden offered ‘unwavering’ support for Israel, which he and administration officials have consistently repeated and backed up with military, financial, and political support, even as mass civilian casualties escalated alongside Israeli genocidal rhetoric,” the CCR said.

The complaint noted that the US is Israel’s closest ally and strongest supporter, as well as its biggest provider of military assistance – with Israel being the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II. Because of this, it said, the US could have a “deterrent effect on Israeli officials now pursuing genocidal acts against the Palestinian people”.

Instead, the group said, Biden, Blinken, and Austin “have helped advance the gravest of crimes” by continuing to provide Israel with unconditional military and diplomatic support while undermining efforts by the international community to stopIsrael’s bombardment.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Astha Sharma Pokharel, a lawyer at the CCR, said: “They have a significant responsibility under customary international law, under federal law, to prevent this genocide, to stop supporting this genocide. At every step of the way, at every opportunity, they have failed. They have continued to provide cover to Israel; they have continued to provide material support to Israel; and currently, they intend to send more money and more weapons to Israel.”

Laila al-Haddad, a US citizen and one of the plaintiffs in the case, has lost five relatives in Gaza since Israel launched its attacks.

“I paid for Israel to kill my cousins and my aunt, there’s no two ways around it,” she told Al Jazeera. “It was my tax dollars that did that, that sent those bombs to Israel to kill my family. And so I feel I and all other American taxpayers have a very unique responsibility to hold our government and our elected officials responsible.”

The lawsuit also calls for an end to the $3.8bn in annual military support the US sends to Israel.

The White House has not yet responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment on the case.

Joe biden,Biden set to make first public outing on world stage as president,"President Joe Biden will make his first major public foray on to the global stage as president on Friday, attending a G-7 summit and addressing the Munich Security Council.

Biden is expected to discuss the global response to COVID-19, stress coordination in responding to Russia and China, and the Iran nuclear deal during the two events.

Biden is also expected to speak about the two-decades war in Afghanistan, where he faces a May 1 deadline to remove the remaining 2,500 US troops under a negotiated agreement with the Taliban by his predecessor Donald Trump’s administration. Transnational challenges ranging from nuclear proliferation to climate change and cybersecurity will also be on the agenda.

In a wider sense, the Democratic president, sworn in less than a month ago, will use the “virtual visit” to Europe to try to re-establish the US as a multilateral team player after four years of divisive “America first” policies pursued by Trump, a senior administration official told reporters in a preview of the event.







At the G7 summit, which will include the leaders of the world’s wealthiest democracies, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan, Biden will pledge $4bn in support of theglobal coronavirus vaccinationeffort, COVAX, which Trump had refused to support.

He will also hail the US’s return to the Paris Agreement on climate, with the US officially re-entering the accord on Friday, after Trump triggered its withdrawal in 2017, and the prospect of a nearly $2 trillion spending measure that could bolster both the US and global economies.

Biden will also pressure countries to invest more and to make good on their commitments to COVAX, an initiative by the World Health Organization to improve access to vaccines. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, on Wednesday, decried the current global vaccine distribution as“wildly unfair”.

Later on Friday morning, Biden will address an online session of the Munich Security Conference, which draws top global leaders and where several years ago as a private citizen he reassured participants rattled by the Trump presidency that “this, too, shall pass” and “we will be back”.

Biden will seek to underscore that democracies, not autocracies, offer the best path forward for the world, after the January 6 siege of the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters made clear that democracy was fragile, the official said.

“He will make a strong, confident case that democracy is the best model for meeting the challenges of our time,” the official said. “Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. We need to fight for it.”

The US president is also expected to speak specifically about “malign” and concerted action he believes Russia has taken to destabilise and undermine democracy in the US, Europe and elsewhere, and will call on allies to stand firm with Washington, the official said.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied such allegations.

Regarding China, the world’s second-largest economy, Biden will urge democracies to work together to push back against practices and policies of the Chinese government that he will describe as “economically abusive and … counter to our values.”

The Biden White House isreviewingChina policy across an array of fronts, including its military buildup and trade policies, its actions in Hong Kong, treatment of minority Uighurs in Xinjiang and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

“He will make clear in the speech that he’s not looking for confrontation, he’s not looking for a new Cold War, but he’s expecting stiff competition and he welcomes it,” the official said.







Biden is also set to discuss the Iran nuclear deal, after his administration said on Thursday it would beopento having an “informal meeting” with Tehran and the other parties to the agreement.

Trump withdrew from the deal – which saw Iran curtail its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief – in 2018 and imposed a maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Tehran.

Biden has made returning to the deal a priority, but both Iran and the US have said it is the other country’s responsibility to make the first move in returning to compliance.

Joe biden,"At UN, Biden urges ‘global action on shared challenges’","US President Joe Biden has criticised over-reliance on military power and promised to pursue global diplomacy to tackle international issues, including theCOVID-19 pandemic,climate change and cyber threats.

In his first speech as US president at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden called for cooperation in the “global community” to address what he called “urgent and looming crises” across the world.

In calling for multilateralism, Biden drew a contrast with his predecessor Donald Trump – who withdrew the US from several UN agencies, including the World Health Organisation and UN Human Rights Council – without naming him.

“We’re back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and to spur global action on shared challenges,” Biden said.

With the end of Washington’smilitary involvementin Afghanistan, Biden said the US will focus its energy and commitment to the future.

“I stand here today for the first time in 20 years with the United States not at war,” he said.

While stressing that the US will defend itself by force if needed, Biden said the military power should be a tool of “last resort”, adding that some of the biggest problems facing the world cannot be solved with weapons.

“Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants,” the US president told the General Assembly. “To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will. We need to act now to get shots in arms as fast as possible and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments to save lives around the world.”

Biden called for creating a “new mechanism” to fund global health security. He also pledged to work with Congress to double Washington’s contributions to an international fund to tackle climate crises in developing nations.

In an apparent message to China, Biden said Washington is not seeking a new Cold War with its strategic competitors.

“The United States is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to shared challenges, even if we have intense disagreement in other areas,” He said.

“We’ll all suffer the consequences of our failure if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19, climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation,” Biden added.







The USdrew China’s ireearlier last week when it announced asecurity partnershipwith the UK and Australia that will see Washington and London help the Australian military acquire nuclear-powered submarines.

Chinese officials called the pact “extremely irresponsible”, accusing the US and its allies of undermining international non-proliferation efforts.

US, UK and Australian leaders have stressed that the submarines will be powered by nuclear power, not carrying nuclear weapons. Australia is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).

On Tuesday, Biden said the US “remains committed” to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, calling for reviving the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran.

The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saw Iran curb its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions against its economy.

Trump nixed the deal in 2018. Six rounds of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna earlier this year failed to restore the pact.

Negotiations have been on ice since June with the election of conservative Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.

“We’re working with the P5+1 to engage Iran diplomatically and seek a return to the JCPOA,” Biden said, referring to the original signatories of the agreement – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. “We’re prepared to return to full compliance if Iran does the same.”







Raisi, in a recorded message to the UN, said he supported a resumption of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, if it would lead to the US removing sanctions it has imposed on the Iranian economy since 2018.

Biden urged using diplomacy, not violence, to resolve tensions in the Middle East, reasserting his administration’s support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“The commitment of the United States to Israel’s security is without question, and our support for an independent, Jewish state is unequivocal,” Biden said.

“But I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish, democratic state living in peace alongside a viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian state.”

Joe biden,What did Biden say about US arms transfers to Israel and what does it mean?,"United States President Joe Biden has facedmonths of growing pressureto stop sending weapons to Israel as the US ally wages war in the Gaza Strip.

Rights advocates, lawmakers and protesters across the US have demanded an end to the transfers, warning the president that the arms were being used in human rights violations and war crimes in Gaza.

This week, seniorBiden administration officials confirmedthat Washington had paused one shipment of “high payload munitions” to Israel over concerns about the Israeli military’s planned offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.

Biden himself appeared to go a step further on Wednesday evening, telling CNN that he would not be “supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah” if Israeli forces go into “population centres”.

But what exactly did Biden say, what do his remarks mean in practice and what do experts say should come next?







CNN’s Erin Burnett asked Biden inan interview that aired on Wednesdayabout his administration’s decision to pause the single weapons shipment to Israel, which contained 1,800 bombs, each weighing about 900kg (2,000lb), and another 1,700 bombs weighing 226kg (500lb) each.

“Have those bombs, thosepowerful, 2,000lb bombs, been used to kill civilians in Gaza?” Burnett asked.

Biden replied: “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they [the Israeli forces] go after population centres.”

“And I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone into Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, that deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.”

The US president added that his administration would “continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of [its] Iron Dome”missile defence systemas well as in its ability to “respond to attacks”.

“But it’s just wrong. We’re not going to supply the weapons and the artillery shells,” he said.

Burnett then asked Biden whether Israeli forces, which this week seized the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and launched deadly attacks on the city, had not already “gone into Rafah”.

“They haven’t gone into the population centres. What they did is right on the border,” Biden said.

“I’ve made it clear to ‘Bibi’ [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] and the war cabinet: They’re not going to get our support if in fact they go into these population centres.”

The Rafah border crossing is, however, contiguous with the town of Rafah, and Palestinians point out that even before Israel seized the area, it had been hitting Rafah with air attacks throughout the war, killing numerous civilians, including children.







Brian Finucane, a senior adviser in the US programme at the International Crisis Group, said Biden was not explicit about the types of weapons that would fall into what he described as those “used historically to deal with Rafah”.

The US president’s remarks also were not “a model of clarity as to what the trigger would be for such a termination, given the fact thatIsraeli troops are already in Rafah“, Finucane told Al Jazeera.

He added that “even if there were an immediate cut-off of air-delivered munitions or artillery shells” to the Israeli military, “that may not have an immediate operational impact based on the stores they may have on hand.”

Still, Finucane said, “This is another step … and it’s an overdue step, but I think it remains to be seen how the Biden administration will carry through on this.”

Patrick Bury, a professor at the University of Bath specialising in warfare, said a wide-scale military operation in Rafah would lead Israel to burn through its munitions very quickly, however.

As a result, a potential US weapons cut-off “is going to be a major consideration” for Israel, Bury told Al Jazeera in a television interview.

Speaking on Thursday, Netanyahu responded to Biden, saying Israel would “stand alone” if it had to.

“I have said that if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails,” the prime minister said in a video address. “But we have much more than fingernails, and with that same strength of spirit, with God’s help, together we will win.”







Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a think tank in Washington, DC, said Biden’s announcement in practice is “very limited, very qualified [and] very conditional”.

Biden’s reasoning also is flawed, Jarrar told Al Jazeera, in that it is tied to a disagreement between the US and Israeli governments over Israel’s military tactics andpush to launch a full-scale attackon Rafah.

However, Jarrar said the US president’s remarks are a signal that Washington’s “blank cheque policy to Israelseems to be coming to an end”.

They also are effectively an “admission that Israel is committing very serious crimes using US weapons – and that admission should lead to very serious consequences that are mandated under US law”, Jarrar said.







Finuncane said it is important “not to lose sight of the larger picture” during discussions on Israel’s military tactics in Rafah.

“The US has substantial leverage to bring to bear to try to bring this conflict to an end,” he said, pointing to the weapons and other military assistance the American government provides to Israel.

“It should be using that leverage after seven long months of conflict to bring about an end to the fighting, enable the hostage exchange, … enable aid to get into Gaza and hopefullylower the temperature in the regionwrit large.”

The US sends Israel $3.8bn in military aid annually, and Congressrecently approved billions of dollarsin additional support for the country.

Jarrar also said the Biden administration needs to apply the country’s own laws, such as the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act. The latter includes the so-calledLeahy Law, which prohibits assistance to foreign military units that commit abuses.

The Biden administration’s own self-declared policy on conventional arms transfers also prohibits weapons transfers to countries “suspected of committing genocide or other broad violations of human rights, using US weapons”, Jarrar said.

The International Court of Justice, the top United Nations court, said in January that there was aplausible risk of genocide in Gazaand ordered Israel to prevent any genocidal acts from taking place in the enclave.

“There is a lot” that the Biden administration can do, Jarrar added. “There are also moral and legal commitments [that] the administration is breaching with its continued aiding and abetting of Israel.”

Joe biden,Joe Biden’s Michigan visit highlights rift with Arab American community,"A visit by United States President Joe Biden to Michigan has exposed a growing divide with the considerable Arab-American community in the key swing state ahead of November’s general election.

Biden sat down with members of the United Auto Workers union on Thursday after they endorsed his re-election bid, but the president’s motorcade had to take side streets in Warren to avoid some two hundred protesters before arriving at its destination.

Crowds of Arab Americans had gathered to display their anger atBiden’s unwavering support for Israeleven as its war on Gaza has killed more than 27,000 people, mostly women and children, amid international calls for a ceasefire.

The protesters in the election battleground state chanted “Genocide Joe has got to go” and waved Palestinian flags, a week after the World CourtorderedIsrael to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza.

“Michigan has a large Arab American and Muslim population who voted overwhelmingly for Biden in the last election,” Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane, reporting from Warren, said. “If he loses even half of their vote, it’s unlikely he can win Michigan – and without Michigan, he has a very narrow path to winning a second term,” she added.

At the protest, anger and disappointment were palpable with several demonstrators saying the US president was “lost to us forever”.

“There is nothing that will ever make me vote for a genocidal president, ever,” a protester who identified as Hawraa told Al Jazeera. “Not only me, but everybody else. My whole Arab community will never vote for this man.”

Salma Hamamy, an activist with Students for Justice in Palestine, said Biden had “entirely abandoned” the Palestinian and Arab communities, as well as “the concept of humanity”.

“Just as he abandoned us, we will be abandoning him on election day,” the protester said, citing Biden’s continued support for Israel.

Arab Americans will no longer choose between the “lesser of two evils”, between the Democrat and Republican candidates, in the next election, she continued. “We will be voting for people who are deserving of our vote”.







Along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Michigan was among the so-called blue wall of states that Biden managed to return to the Democrats when he was elected in 2020.

Michigan has turned increasingly Democratic in recent years, with the party now controlling all levels of state government for the first time in four decades. Biden is looking to secure the critical 15 electoral votes that the battleground state can bring.

But Israel’s war on Gaza has impacted his chances.

“There is real anger in the [Arab American] community,” James Zogby, president of the Washington, DC-based Arab American Institute, told Al Jazeera.

“Imagine a situation where a sitting president comes to town and people are trying to set up a meeting with him before he comes, and the community says, ‘We don’t want to meet with him,’ and they reject it, and finally the White House has to abandon plans to do it,” Zogby said, predicting that a loss in Michigan would mean a Biden defeat in November.

Democratic strategists are hoping the potential of another Donald Trump presidency will be enough to change the community’s minds – but Khalid Turaani, who helped launch the Abandon Biden movement, said that would not work.

“Because Joe Biden is president, we don’t believe that the Israelis are bombing a little bit less. So when we have Trump, I don’t believe they’re just going to bomb a little bit more just because Trump is president,” he told Al Jazeera.

“We need a ceasefire.”

Joe biden,Five key takeaways from Joe Biden’s UNGA speech,"Joe Biden has accused Russia of aiming to end Ukraine’s right to exist as a nation, telling theUnited Nations General Assembly(UNGA) that Washington wants the conflict to end on “just terms”.

In his second address to the UNGA as president of the United States, Biden on Wednesday stressed that Russia violated the UN Charter when it invaded its neighbour earlier this year.

He also touched on a variety of international issues, including the global need to combat climate change andfood insecurity.

Here’s a look at five key takeaways from Biden’s speech:

Biden kicked off his remarks by condemning theRussian invasionof Ukraine as an unjustified act of aggression.

“This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and [Ukrainians’] right to exist as a people,” Biden said. “Wherever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should make your blood run cold.”

Biden also dismissed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claim that Russia was threatened by Ukraine’s push to join NATO.

“The United States wants this war to end on just terms, on terms we’re all signed up for – that you cannot seize a nation’s territory by force,” he said.

Biden’s remarks came just hours after Putin announced apartial military mobilisationon Wednesday, calling up as many as 300,000 army reservists to serve in Ukraine.

Russia’s offensive has experienced major setbacks in recent weeks, with Ukrainian forces – backed by US weaponry – recapturing large swaths of territories in a rapid advance in the east of the country.

Biden called for reforms to the UN Security Council (UNSC) to make it more inclusive and better equipped to respond to global challenges.

He said the number of countries who sit on the 15-member body should be increased. Currently, the UNSC has five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US – and 10 rotating states elected to two-year terms.

“We have long supported permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean,” Biden told the General Assembly.

Permanent members of the council have veto power that limits the council’s ability to pass resolutions against them or their allies.

Although Washington has deployed its veto power on the Security Councildozens of timesto shield Israel, a top US ally, from criticism over violations of international law, Biden said on Wednesday that vetoes should be used sparingly.

“Members of the UN Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the UN Charter and refrain from the use of the veto except in rare, extraordinary situations to ensure that the council remains credible and effective,” Biden said.

Since taking office in early 2021, Biden has continued his predecessor Donald Trump’s approach of prioritisingcompetition with Chinain US foreign policy. But on Wednesday, the US president said Washington wants to avoid confrontation with Beijing.

“Let me be direct about the competition between the United States and China as we manage shifting geopolitical trends: The United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader,” Biden said.

“We do not seek conflict. We do not seek acold war. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.”

Biden has drawn Beijing’s fury for saying on various occasions that Washington would militarilydefend Taiwan– a self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own –  if China were to invade.

On Wednesday, Biden said the US opposes “unilateral changes in the status quo by either side”.

A staunch supporter of Israel, Biden on Wednesday reaffirmed his administration’s support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“The United States is committed to Israel’s security – full stop,” Biden said. “And a negotiated, two-state solution remains in our view the best way to ensure Israel’s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled.”

Throughout his White House tenure, Biden has refused to criticise Israeli abuses against Palestinians, including the expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem – territories that would be home to a future Palestinian state.

Moreover, the US president has kept Israel’s US embassy in Jerusalem – a contentious move by Trump that drew Palestinian and international outrage – while failing to deliver on his campaign promise to reopen a consulate for Palestinians in theholy city.

Verbally backing the two-state solution has been the policy of successive US administrations.

But many Palestinian rights advocates have said such a resolution to the conflict has become impossible due to the prevalence of Israel settlements in occupied territory. They argue that talk of a two-state solution allows Israel to maintain the status quo.

On Wednesday, Biden said both sides deserve to “enjoy an equal measure of freedom and dignity”.

The US provides $3.8bn in annual military aid to Israel, which has been accused of imposing a system ofapartheidagainst Palestinians.

Amid stalled negotiations to revive the 2015Iran nuclear agreement, Biden pledged on Wednesday that Washington will not let Iran obtain a nuclear weapon.

Numerous rounds of indirect talks so far have failed to revive the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for international sanction relief.

“While the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons,” Biden said.

Trump nixed the JCPOA in 2018 and unleashed a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions against Iran’s economy. In response, Tehran has been escalating its nuclear programme, but Iranian officials deny seeking nuclear weapons.

On Wednesday, Biden also paid a nod to continuing anti-governmentprotests in Iranthat were sparked by the death of a woman in police custody. “Today, we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/21/five-key-takeaways-from-joe-bidens-unga-speech,POSITIVE,0.9680546522140503
Joe biden,"US, Russia to enter ‘strategic stability’ dialogue: Biden","United States President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have agreed to engage in a bilateral dialogue on “strategic stability” aimed at reducing the risks of unintentional conflict and restrain nuclear weapons, Biden said in a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday.

Speaking after a three-hour series ofmeetings, Biden said he urged Putin to respect human rights and political freedoms in Russia and asked him to reopen humanitarian corridors in Syria to allow delivery of food and cooperate in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Biden said he had expressed an “unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine” and discussed the US and Russia’s shared interest in preventing “a resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan”.

He also stressed to Putin the importance to the American people of respect for “human rights” and US concern about the arrest of opposition political figure Alexey Navalny.

“I told President Putin that we need to have some basic rules of the road that we all abide by,” Biden said.

“I also said there are areas where there’s a mutual interest for us to cooperate for our people, Russian and American people, but also for the benefit of the world and the security of the world,” Biden said, adding that there is “more work to do” and the next six months to a year would show whether the US and Russia can engage in more cooperative relations.







The US and Russian presidents agreed to resume arms control talks and to return ambassadors to each other’s capitals after they were withdrawn earlier this year.

Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin met for about three hours at their first summit on Wednesday, less time than Biden’s advisers had expected, the Reuters news service reported.

Prior to the meeting in Geneva, White House officials had outlinedthree broad objectivesfor the summit with Putin.

First, they hoped to find clear areas where the two nations can work together to make the world safer and the summit yielded an agreement by Putin to engage in talks aimed at limiting nuclear weapons.

Biden planned to convey to Putin a clear statement of US national interests on key issues and warn that Russian actions counter to those interests would be met with a US response. On the Russian side, Putin waslooking for a shift in tonefrom Washington.

Responding to questions from the American media, Biden argued Russia would be viewed more favourably by other nations for investment and trade if Moscow respected political rights at home and operated within international norms. And Biden offered some details of their back-and-forth conversation.

Putin had pressed Biden on whether the US will be able to maintain security and stability in Afghanistan after US and NATO troops withdraw. Biden said he responded that would depend in party on Russia’s actions and Putin offered to help.

Putin also pressed Biden on why the US continues to oppose the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Biden said he tied US policy to Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons.

Biden mostly avoided contradicting Putin on hot-button issues of cyberattacks and Russia’s interference in US elections and stopped short of expressing confidence the summit would yield a change in Russian conduct.

“There’s a genuine prospect to significantly improve relations between our two countries without giving up a single solitary thing based on principle, and our values,” Biden said.

In a separate post-meeting news conference, Putin described the dialogue with his US counterpart as pragmatic and without hostility. It showed the leaders’ desire to understand each other, said Putin, who added he saw Biden as “experienced” and “balanced”.

Putin said Russia and the US shared the responsibility for nuclear stability, and would hold talks on possible changes to their recently extended New START arms limitation treaty that was renewed in January for another five years.

“If you look at the very big picture, the strategic discussions moving on from New START – the nuclear policy regarding these two major nuclear powers – clearly we should all be a little relieved that they are talking about that, potentially going to talk further on that,” said Al Jazeera diplomatic editor James Bays.

The Russian president dismissed Washington’s concerns about the arrest of opposition political figureAlexey Navalny, Russia’s military presence in easternUkraine, and US allegations that Russian hackers were responsible for a series ofcyberattacksin the US.

Diplomatic relations between Moscow and Washington deteriorated in March when Biden said he thought Putin was a “killer“, prompting Russia to recall its ambassador to Washington for consultations. The US recalled its ambassador from Moscow in April.

Putin, who warned two weeks ago he thinks the US is trying tohold Russia back, said on Wednesday he was satisfied by Biden’s explanation of the remark.

“Clearly President Biden wanted to strike a tone of being willing to try to work together if Putin is willing to try to work together and to de-escalate tensions, as the Biden administration has said repeatedly, to try to create a more stable and predictable relationship,” former US ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/16/biden-putin-geneva-press-conference-remarks,NEGATIVE,0.5179622173309326
Joe biden,"Plane, motorcade, train: How Joe Biden got to Kyiv in secret","President Joe Biden’ssurprise visitMonday morning to wartime Kyiv began in the dead of night at a military airport hangar outside Washington, DC.

At 4:00 am (09:00 GMT) Sunday, unbeknown to the world’s media, the Washington political establishment or American voters, the 80-year-old Democrat boarded an Air Force Boeing 757, known as a C-32.

The plane, a smaller version of the one US presidents normally use on international trips, was parked well away from where Biden would usually board. And a telling detail: The shade on every window had been pulled down.

The White House had discussed the possibility of a Bidentrip to Kyivfor a year, and the president made the final decision to go on Friday. The trip was the first for a US president into an active warzone where US forces were not involved in the fighting and the US did not control the airspace.

Fifteen minutes after arriving at Joint Base Andrews early Sunday morning, Biden, a handful of security personnel, a small medical team, close advisers, and two journalists who had been sworn to secrecy, took off en route to a warzone.

The US president is perhaps the most constantly scrutinised person on the planet.

Members of the press follow Biden wherever he goes, whether to church or international summits. Every word he says in public is recorded, transcribed and published.

In this case, though, the usual pool of reporters, which for foreign trips would consist of 13 journalists from radio, TV, photo and written press organisations, was cut to one photographer and one writer.

The reporter, Sabrina Siddiqui from The Wall Street Journal, revealed, once allowed by the White House to publish details, that she and the photographer were summoned to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington at 2:15am (07:15 GMT).

Their phones were confiscated, not to be returned until Biden finallyarrivedin the Ukrainian capital about 24 hours later.

They flew for about seven hours from Washington to the US military base in Ramstein, Germany, for refuelling. Here, too, the window shades stayed down and they did not leave the plane.

The next flight was to Poland, landing in Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport. This may be a Polish airport, but since the Ukraine war, it has also become an international hub for the US-led effort to arm the Ukrainians, funnelling billions of dollars of weaponry and ammunition.

Up to this point, Siddiqui and the photographer, The Associated Press’s Evan Vucci, had not seen Biden himself. That did not change at the airport or when they got into a motorcade of SUVs.

Reporters travelling with Biden often go in motorcades, but something was very different about this one: No sirens or anything else to announce that the US president was headed to Przemysl Glowny, the Polish train station near the Ukrainian border.

It was already 9:15pm local time (20:15 GMT) as they pulled up at a train. The journalists were told to board, still without laying eyes on Biden.

Running a route that has brought untold quantities of aid into Ukraine and untold numbers of Ukrainian civilians fleeing the other way, the train had about eight cars. Most of the people on board, Siddiqui said, were “heavy security”.

Biden is an avowed train buff.

He loves recounting his years of commuting by rail riding the US train carrier Amtrak between Washington and home in Delaware when he was a senator, bringing up two young sons after their mother died in a car accident. One of his nicknames is “Amtrak Joe”.

This 10-hour trip into Ukraine, though, was unlike any taken by a modern US president, journeying into an active warzone where, unlike presidential visits to Afghanistan or Iraq, US troops are not the ones providing security.

The train rolled into Kyiv with the rising sun.

Biden, who had last visited the Ukrainian capital when he was vice president under Barack Obama disembarked at about 8:07am (06:07 GMT) Monday.

The area around the platform had been cleared and the US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, awaited Biden and his staff.

“It’s good to be back in Kyiv,” he said.

US national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who accompanied the president, said US officials did notify Russian officials that Biden would be travelling to Kyiv. “We did so some hours before his departure for deconfliction purposes,” he told reporters on a conference call, declining to provide more details.

The head of Russia’s Special Security Service (FSB) confirmed Sullivan’s account.

“The United States did notify Russia about Biden’s visit to Kyiv through a diplomatic channel. We did not give guarantees of his safety,” FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov was quoted by Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency as saying Tuesday.

Sullivan said the trip had “required a security, operational, and logistical effort from professionals across the US government to take what was an inherently risky undertaking and make it a manageable level of risk”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/21/plane-motorcade-train-how-joe-biden-got-to-kyiv-in-secret,NEGATIVE,0.9931835532188416
Joe biden,US speeds Afghanistan withdrawal as Biden sets August deadline,"United States President Joe Biden said on Thursday the US military would complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan by August 31, ahead of schedule, and dismissed mounting concerns about a civil war developing in the country occupied by the US since 2001.

“The mission is accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and that terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” Biden insisted, defending his decision to keep up therapid US withdrawalin the face of widening Taliban attacks on Afghan forces.

The US invaded Afghanistan after the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. The US has withdrawn approximately 3,500 remaining troops in a process the US military now says is 90 percent complete.

“Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly,” Biden said.

“In this context speed is safety,” said the president, who is commander-in-chief of the military in the US system of government and holds ultimate authority over the deployment of troops.

The US will continue to have a few hundred troops in Afghanistan to maintain security for the US embassy and diplomatic community in Kabul as well as the city’s airport. And US officials have said the military will maintain an “over-the-horizon” capability to respond to events.

The US withdrawal follows aUS agreementreached under former President Donald Trump in talks headed by US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad with the Taliban in Qatar. The US agreed that US and foreign forceswould leave by May 1. In exchange, the Taliban promised to negotiate a peace agreement with the Western-backed government in Kabul.

When Biden came to office in January he was confronted with a stark choice of following through on the agreement with the Taliban or seeing US forces drawn back into a widening war.

Biden said on Thursday he and his top advisers had concluded the only path to peace and stability in Afghanistan is through a negotiated agreement between the Western-backed Afghan government in Kabul, regional leaders and the Taliban.

“We did not go into Afghanistan to nation-build,” the president said.

In the first significant peace talks between the Kabul government and the Taliban in months, a government delegation met Taliban representatives in Tehran on July 8. The two warring sidesissued a joint statementthat said “war is not the solution to the Afghanistan problem.”

It came as the Taliban claimed to have captured a main border crossing with Iran Thursday, with the Taliban spokesman posting a video showing purported fighters taking the Islam Qala border crossing and being welcomed by local residents. It would be the third international border the group has seized, as its fighters take territory around the country.

A Pentagon spokesman said on Thursday that Taliban fighters hadtaken dozens of district centersin Afghanistan.

“They have taken dozens of district centres, that is true. And we believe that they mean to threaten provincial centres as well,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

A defensive Biden batted back several shouted questions from reporters at the White House, rejecting comparisons to the US departure from Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war.

“No. No, no, no,” Biden says when asked if the US bears responsibility for Afghan lives lost post-withdrawal.

“It’s up to the people of Afghanistan to decide what government they want, not to impose the government upon them.”

Biden denied that US intelligence agencies have concluded that the Afghan government will fall to the Taliban without the presence of US forces. Bidenmet at the White Housewith Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and national council chairman Abdullah Abdullah on June 25 and pledged continuing US financial and diplomatic support for the government.

The Afghan army is well trained and equipped, Biden said, and a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is not inevitable. The US has trained and equipped more than 300,000 Afghan soldiers and police although the Afghan military still relies on the US and foreign contractors for air support.

“I do not trust the Taliban but I trust the capacity of the Afghan military,” Biden said.

Biden offered a message to interpreters and other Afghans who worked with troops: “There is a home for you in the United States, if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.”

Congress is advancing legislation that Biden supports to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to re-locating potential thousands of Afghans and their families to US territory, potentially the Pacifica island of Guam.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/mission-accomplished-us-speeds-afghanistan-withdrawal,POSITIVE,0.9955417513847351
Joe biden,Can Joe Biden oversee an economic boom that unites a divided US?,"When Joe Biden entered the White House as vice president, the United States economy was cratering. Job losses were mounting. Stocks were crashing. Millions of Americans were in the early stages of losing their homes to foreclosure as the housing bubble burst.

Biden returns to the White House as president a dozen years later with the economy battered and shaken by a pandemic. But this time is different — and it could reset the nation’s politics if Biden and Democrats can count on a level of growth not seen in a generation.

Despite the 9.8 million jobs lost due to the coronavirus, there are signs the country is on the cusp of a kind of boom unseen in the eras of Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

Checking account balances have surged by $2.4 trillion since the outbreak began. Home prices are soaring because of hot demand. And each additional vaccination moves the world’s largest economy closer to fully reopening.

“If the economy is improving substantially by spring or early summer, that might actually help Biden get more of his agenda done … because success can beget success,” said Jason Furman, who was top economist for the Obama administration. He pointed to the possibility of growth easing the path for an infrastructure programme and climate investments.

But hanging over any effort to boost the economy is an enduring partisan divide that contributed to the deadly assault on the US Capitol this month as Biden’s Electoral College victory was set to be certified. Politics is increasingly shaping how Americans feel about the economy, scrambling the political incentives for lawmakers to cooperate.

There also are concerns about whether the worsening pandemic and slow pace of vaccinations thus far could portend more serious problems on the coronavirus front that could hurt the economic recovery.

The potential for a boom reflects in large part the roughly $4 trillion approved so far in federal aid, with Biden last week proposing $1.9 trillion more, an unprecedented level of stimulus. The additional money, which must be approved by Congress, is intended to accelerate the vaccine roll-out, reopen schools and reduce the child poverty rate to a historic low.

The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates that growth this year could be 6.6 percent if part of Biden’s stimulus plan passes.

That would be the strongest gain since 1984, when a 7.2 percent increase in the gross domestic product helped carry Republican President Ronald Reagan to a second term in a landslide. Wells Fargo forecasts growth of 4.6 percent this year, which would be the best since 1999.

Still, there are plenty of economic risks facing Biden. The most bullish forecasts hinge on getting much of Biden’s aid package through Congress. And any gains would probably depend on overcoming the pandemic. There is also the possibility that the added stimulus championed by Biden could be more than the economy needs, perhaps stirring inflation.

But the Great Recession taught Biden’s team the benefit of going big with stimulus. Incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain says Biden’s officials learned the hard way that the roughly $800bn approved in 2009 to fight the Great Recession was insufficient, a mistake they’re unwilling to repeat this time.

“It wasn’t large enough,” Klain said Friday at a livestreamed Washington Post event. “Our recovery lagged as a result.”

During the first nine months of the Obama presidency, the unemployment rate climbed to 10 percent and the swift recovery that was predicted never happened as the country took years to work through housing foreclosures and rebuild its financial system.

This left Obama administration officials having to argue that the economy would have been even worse without the stimulus. Republicans countered that the effort had flopped as they won control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections.

“There isn’t much doubt that the economy did better in 2009 and 2010 because of the recovery act,” said Douglas Elmendorf, who was director of the Congressional Budget Office at the time and now serves as dean of Harvard University’s Kennedy School. “Too many people took the failure to hit [stronger growth] as a sign that the stimulus didn’t work, when, in fact, the economy was worse off than widely understood.”

Biden can count on backing from Wall Street investors this time to borrow. Helped by supportive Federal Reserve policies, low interest rates make it easier to keep financing a stimulus and repay added debt.

The interest rate on a 10-year US Treasury note is about 1.15 percent, compared with 11.67 percent in 1984 when growth prospects last looked this good and the size of the federal debt was significantly smaller.

Republican lawmakers still see the need for more aid to contain the pandemic, but some are voicing concerns about Biden’s desire for another big spending package. They stress that any new spending should be directed towards increasing vaccinations and that Biden’s proposal for direct cheques of $1,400 per person could delay people from returning to work.

“Blasting out another $2 trillion in borrowed or printed money — when the ink on December’s $1 trillion aid bill is barely dry and much of the money is not yet spent — would be a colossal waste and economically harmful,” Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said in a statement.

Republican voters have already turned bearish on the economy after Trump lost the election. The University of Michigan reported Friday that its index of consumer expectations among Republicans plunged from a reading of 96 in October to 53 in January. That could dampen their willingness to spend and encourage Republican lawmakers to blame Democrats for any economic ills.

For now, the Biden team is hoping to push through its stimulus with Republican support in the Senate. But the political tensions might force him to pursue many of his initiatives — like a $15 hourly minimum wage and tax increases on corporations and the wealthy — with only Democratic support.

Should Republicans regain control in Congress, any policies passed exclusively with Democratic backing could be quickly reversed or allowed to expire. This seesawing between conflicting policies could erode the degree of certainty that businesses and consumers need to make investments that lead to growth, said Donald Schneider, a member of the policy research team at Cornerstone Macro and former chief economist of the House Ways and Means Committee.

“It is a big problem going forward if one side comes to power and makes changes and then the other side comes into power and reverses them and on and on it goes,” Schneider said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/1/18/can-joe-biden-oversee-an-economic-boom-that-unites-a-divided-us,NEGATIVE,0.9472049474716187
Joe biden,Five key moments that shaped Biden’s presidency so far,"Washington, DC –Joe Biden’s record as United States president will weigh heavily on his re-election chances as he seeks a second term in the White House.

At his campaign launch on Tuesday, the 80-year-old president promised to push forward with the policies he started when he first took office early in 2021 and work to heal the “soul of the nation” after the turbulent presidency of Donald Trump.

“I said we are in a battle for the soul of America, and we still are,” Biden said in a three-minute video. “The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer.”

Biden is positioning his campaign as a contrast with Republican policies he says have become dominated by Trump-like, right-wing hardliners.

But as Biden faces criticism for his stance on the economy and foreign policy, the 2024 vote will likely be a referendum on his first term in office. Here, Al Jazeera looks at five key moments that have shaped Biden’s presidency.

Biden came into the White House with a reputation as a cautious centrist, but he soon unveiled an ambitious $3 trillion plan that would have expanded social safety net programmes and made enormous investments in clean energy, education and housing.

The plan, dubbed Build Back Better, was to be the core of his self-proclaimed agenda to revive the economy “from the bottom up and the middle out”.

The bill was later scaled downto $1.75 trillionin spending, to be spread over 10 years. It was approved by the House of Representatives but was subsequently dropped amid opposition from two conservative Democrats in the Senate, where Biden’s party had a razor-thin margin.

The demise of the Build Back Better plan early in 2022 was a blow for Biden’s agenda. However, in his first years in office, Biden still managed to pass legislation worth trillions of dollars to advance his policies.

In March 2021, Bidensigned into lawa $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill that included direct payments of $1,400 to most American adults.

Later that year, he also oversaw thepassage of a lawthat designated $1.2 trillion to the country’s physical infrastructure, like roads and bridges. The measure had enjoyed bipartisan support for years. Once it passed, Biden used it to promote his ability to work with Republicans.

Biden signed another big-spending law in August 2022, called the Inflation Reduction Act, a $740bn bill that made funds for healthcare and energy policies.

When Biden came into office, he continued with the plan to pull US troopsout of Afghanistan— a 20-year conflict that had turned into Washington’s longest war.

The withdrawal was popular amongst Americans, according to public opinion polls. But the Afghan governmentquickly collapsedto Taliban forces without putting up a serious fight, something Biden later admitted happened “more quickly than we anticipated”.

After the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021, US troops — confined to the area around the city’s airport until their final withdrawal at the end of the month — oversaw a two-week operation to get desperate Afghans out of the country.

During the evacuation, a suicide bombing by the Afghanistan branch of ISIL (ISIS) killedat least 175 people, including 13 US service members.

The chaotic US exit from Afghanistan, which came about six months into Biden’s first term, subjected the president to a barrage of criticism from Republicans and even some Democrats.

Still, the president vehemently defended his decisions. “I was not going to extend this forever war,”he saidin a speech after the last US soldier left Afghanistan.

In a report released earlier this month, US agenciesblamed Trumpfor what they called a lack of planning for the withdrawal despite having agreed to it in a deal with the Taliban in February 2020.

“PresidentBiden’s choicesfor how to execute a withdrawal from Afghanistan were severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor,” it read.

Weeks after taking office, Biden helda phone callwith his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, setting a tone for a contentious relationship with Beijing.

A White House statement describing the call said Biden raised several issues with Xi which would go on to become majorpoints of tensionbetween the two countries.

“President Biden affirmed his priorities of protecting the American people’s security, prosperity, health and way of life, and preserving a free and openIndo-Pacific,” the statement said.

“President Biden underscored his fundamental concerns about Beijing’s coercive and unfair economic practices, crackdown in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including toward Taiwan.”

Biden drew China’s ire later that year when he announced a deal —dubbed AUKUS— with the United Kingdom to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.

The US president also held the first in-person summit with the leaders of the so-calledQuad alliance, which includes India, Japan and Australia and is largely seen as a counterweight to China in the Asia-Pacific region.

Last year, Biden again outraged Beijing when he said US forceswould defend Taiwanif the self-ruled island were to be invaded by China.

Relations further soured between Washington and Beijing earlier this year when the USshot down what it said was a Chinese surveillance balloonthat had traversed North America. China insisted that the aircraft was a weather balloon that had drifted off course.

Despite increasing strains on the US-China relationship, Biden has said repeatedly that he is not seeking a cold war.

However, his approach of treating Beijing as the US’s top geopolitical challenge echoes that of Trump, who initiated atrade warwith China.

TheRepublican red waveanticipated to sweep the 2022 midterm elections barely made a splash. Instead, Biden’s Democratic Party expanded its Senate majority and only narrowly lost control of the House of Representatives.

One of the defining issues in the election was abortion rights. Less than five months prior, theUS Supreme Courthad overturned the constitutional right to abortion, a decision that Biden decried as an attack on women’s reproductive freedom.

Protecting abortion access became a central campaign theme for Democrats in key midterm races. Voters in states likeMichigan and Kentuckyvoted down anti-abortion rights measures.

Meanwhile, Republicans focused on inflation, though Biden did not shy away from his economic record ahead of the election. Heoften toutedthe 2021 infrastructure law and other investments his administration approved.

After the midterms, Biden pledged to push to unite the US and continue to pursue key elements of his platform.

“The overwhelming majority of the American people support the elements of my economic agenda — from rebuilding America’s roads and bridges, to lowering prescription drug costs, to a historic investment in tackling the climate crisis, to making sure that large corporations begin to pay their fair share in taxes,” he said in a speech days after the vote.

Despite the Democrats’ expectations-defying performance, however, they neverthelesslost their majorityin the House. And without the support of Congress’s lower chamber, Biden’s legislative agenda has faced an uphill battle, pushing the president to be increasingly reliant on executive orders.

Speaking to thousands in Warsaw, Poland, in February,Biden promisedthat the war in Ukraine “will never be a victory for Russia”.

The speech marked the first anniversary of Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbour and followed a surprisetrip to Kyiv, where Biden met with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In Warsaw, the US president reasserted Washington’s approach of working to maintain Western unity and ensuring military and humanitarianaid to Kyiv.

“One year after the bombs began to fall and Russian tanks rolled in Ukraine, Ukraine is still independent and free,” Biden said.

“There should be no doubt: Our support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided and we will not tire,” Biden told the crowd in the Polish capital.

The Russian military campaign has been marred by setbacks that the Biden administration credits to the strength of Ukrainian resistance as well as Western support to the country.

Biden stressed in February that Russian President Vladimir Putin is failing in Ukraine.

Putin “thought he’d get the Finland-isation of NATO; instead he got the NATO-isation of Finland and Sweden,” Biden said in February, referring to two northern European countries that were formerly neutral but have sincepushed to jointhe US-led alliance.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/25/five-key-moments-that-shaped-biden-presidency,NEGATIVE,0.5097571015357971
Joe biden,US House Republicans release impeachment report on President Joe Biden,"Republicans in the United States House of Representatives have released a report alleging Democratic President Joe Biden committed impeachable offences, but it is unclear whether they would push for a vote following a probe that the White House has long dismissed as politically motivated.

A 291-page report by three House committees alleged that Biden profited from an influence-peddling scheme to enrich himself and members of his family through foreign business dealings beginning in 2014 when Biden was vice president.

Jim Jordan, head of the Judiciary Committee, said the investigation showed “conclusively” that Biden had “abused his public office for the private financial benefit of the Biden family and Biden business associates.”

“President Biden’s legacy is marked by abuse of public office, corruption and obstruction. The evidence produced by our impeachment inquiry is the strongest case for impeachment of a sitting president the House of Representatives has ever investigated,” said James Comer, head of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.

But the nearly yearlong inquiry released by the Republicans on Monday, stops short of alleging any criminal wrongdoing by the president, who decided last month not to run for re-election this year.

Instead, the report, also released on the opening day of theDemocratic National Convention, covers familiar ground, asserting the Biden family traded on its “brand” in business ventures in corrupt ways that rise to the US Constitution’s high bar for impeachment.

Republicans have for years used Biden’s sonHunter’sforeign links and chaotic personal life as a recovering drug addict to try to embarrass his father.

They have alleged the Biden family and its associates received about $27m in business payments from partners or clients in Russia, China and other countries. They alleged an additional $8m in loans, including some from Hunter Biden benefactor Kevin Morris, a Hollywood attorney, and question the purchases of the son’s artwork.

The report said it is “inconceivable” that President Biden did not understand what was going on.

“President Biden participated in a conspiracy to monetize his office of public trust to enrich his family,” the report alleged.







Biden – set to deliver a swan song speech at the Democratic convention and pass the political torch to his vice president, Kamala Harris – has repeatedly denied helping his son’s business ventures, including in Ukraine and China.

The White House has dismissed the House impeachment inquiry as a “stunt” and encouraged House Republicans to “move on”.

Many also see the Republicans’ report as a bid for revenge over the two impeachments of RepublicanDonald Trumpwhen he was president. Trump, who survived both trials in the Senate, is his party’s presidential candidate for a third time and will face Harris in the November 5 election.

Meanwhile, with President Biden no longer running for re-election, the next steps are uncertain.

House Republicans have not had support from their own ranks to actually impeach the president, and removal by the Senate, which Democrats control with the help of a few independent members, is even further afield.

Many Republicans also prefer to focus attention now on Harris.

While Harris is not mentioned in Monday’s report, the same committees leading the inquiry have begun to open new probes into her and her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/19/us-house-republicans-release-impeachment-report-on-president-joe-biden,NEGATIVE,0.9898978471755981
Joe biden,Will Joe Biden alter US policy in the Middle East?,"America has voted. While the official result is still pending, most experts concur: Joe Biden will become the 46th president of the United States.

The soon-to-be commander-in-chief never left any doubt about his plans to bring about a paradigm shift in policy, domestically, as well as on the international stage: A goodbye to President Donald Trump’s “America First”, that, according to Biden, “has made America alone”, and a hello to multilateralism and pushing respect for normative values.

The latter is of particular relevance for the Middle East and will alter the region’s status quo.

Biden is expected to continue the US’s withdrawal from the region, even more so since championing a return to a more conventional foreign policy that is likely to play second fiddle to domestic emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic and an American economy on its knees.

Nonetheless, Biden will make his presence felt in the Middle East.

Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, in 2018.

In lieu of diplomatic efforts, his administration applied a “maximum pressure” campaign – an attempt to coerce Tehran into renegotiating the deal entirely.

Biden sees this approach as a “dangerous failure” and has repeatedly praised the deal and pledged to reverse Trump’s withdrawal, “if Iran moves back into compliance with its nuclear obligations”, as hetoldthe Council on Foreign Relations in 2019.







Biden seeks to make the Iranian government more predictable by reintegrating it into interrelationships. Moreover, Biden also seeks to send a signal to the world and its allies that the US is “a partner whose word can be relied on” – a sentiment not felt by many in the international community as of late.

However, an end to the stringent US stance towards a detente is not straight forward. For one, Iran will presumably demand compensation for the economic downfall the sanctions caused, Tehran University professor Hassan Ahmadian has argued.

Mistrust is another factor.

“You cannot trust Democrats,” a hardliner official close to the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reportedly said.

Moreover, Senate Republicans and America’s main allies in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia, will oppose the US’s re-entering the nuclear deal with Iran, according to Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Iran’s current economic situation is a factor pushing it to seek an amicable solution. However, with upcoming Iranian presidential elections in mid-2021 and Biden’s domestic focus on the pandemic, talks should not be expected to start anytime soon.

Biden’s strategy for the broader Middle East region remains unclear. Experts cannot conclude whether or not Biden will proceed with the US withdrawal that began under president Barrack Obama and reached its apogee under Trump.

However, what appears certain is the years of interventionism are over. Biden does not seem to be interested in nation-building or toppling governments.

What is known is that Biden has pledged to not withdraw all remaining troops but to maintain a small military presence in northeast Syria while continuing sanctions on the government of President Bashar al-Assad – similar to Trump’s approach.

Biden has also made it clear that any Middle East entanglements must concern American interests first and foremost.

In terms of Afghanistan, Biden’s online campaign manifesto states he will “bring the vast majority of our troops home from Afghanistan and narrowly focus our mission on al-Qaeda and ISIS [ISIL]”, two armed groups that have remained a “cohesive threat”,according toAnthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Hence, wherever American security interests are not at stake, US soldiers are unlikely to play a significant role.

Biden has pledged to reverse what many consider to be the cornerstone of Trump’s foreign policy: ignoring autocracy and human rights violations in favour of realpolitik.

After the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s (MBS) policies, Trump expressed only cautious criticism of MBS and his role in the killing, even after the CIA concluded he had ordered Khashoggi’s death.

It is precisely the “dangerous blank cheque” for Saudi Arabia that Biden condemned in the past.

As president, Bidenannouncedon the second anniversary of the Khashoggi murder in early October, he would review US relations with Saudi Arabia and defend the rights of activists, political dissidents, and journalists, before vowing to no longer leave American values “​​at the cloakroom to sell weapons or buy oil”.

The latter also applies to the war in Yemen, which has devastated millions and remains a humanitarian catastrophe. Biden’s pledge to cease US arms shipments for Saudi Arabia’s war could profoundly impact MBS.

Diplomatic sources werequotedrecently as saying a Biden administration would not put US-Saudi relations to the test, but the unconditional support from the White House that MBS is used to could now depend on the kingdom’s willingness to advance in questions of human rights.







“The best friend Israel ever in the White House,” Benjamin Netanyahusaidof Trump. And not without sound reasons, as the gifts from Washington were plentiful.

Trump fulfilled his campaign promise to relocate the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and his Middle East plan was also widely considered advantageous towards Israel.

The White House also ceased financial contributions to the Palestinian Authority and its share towards UN Palestine aid.

Most recently, Trump brokered two “normalisation” deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain that have strengthened Israel’s position and isolated the Palestinians further.

Nonetheless, experts do not expect the modus operandi to change significantly under Biden. While the president-elect has already stated he would not move the embassy back to Tel Aviv, he will also not reverse Trump’s recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights either, a senior Biden campaign officialstatedon Tuesday.

Moreover, Biden has also vehemently opposed pro-Palestinian initiatives from within his party. During the Democratic primaries, Senator Bernie Sanders suggested the US ought to utilise its Israel support as leverage and demand concessions for the Palestinians.

Biden’sresponsewas concise as it was unmistakable: “ridiculous and unacceptable”, he called Sanders’ idea.

Biden’s reaction to the UAE-Israel deal also displayed his support for Israel. He called the deal a “historic breakthrough” and promised to persuade more countries in the region to sign similar agreements.

What sets Biden apart is his pledge to reverse Trump’s withdrawal of economic and humanitarian assistance from the Palestinians and his pursuit to reopen the Palestinian Liberation Organization’s mission in Washington, as well as the US consulate in Jerusalem for Palestinian affairs.

However, Biden’s Israel policy is likely to be a continuation, not a reset – an approach, some experts argue could sum up Biden’s upcoming Middle East policy in general.

Joe biden,Biden’s fossil fuel hypocrisy is betraying the planet,"Ahead of itsClimate Ambition Summitin September, the United Nations is calling on global leaders to phase out fossil fuels. US President Joe Biden is painfully falling behind on this agenda and must urgently get back on track to maintain any credibility in these climate discussions.

As we suffer throughextreme heatin the US and across the globe, President Biden has been protecting fossil fuel profits instead of people. Fromthe Willow Project in Alaskato Gulf LNG exports, Biden props up dangerous oil and gas projects and the corporations that value their bottom line over our future. It has to stop.









The latest reports from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) show that maintaining a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 degrees Fahrenheit) requires an immediate end to investments in new coal, oil and gas production and hazardous liquified fossil gas (LNG) infrastructure.

These findings remain unchanged in the context of the war in Ukraine and its impact on global energy markets, and as last year’s World Energy Outlook said: “No one should imagine that Russia’s invasion can justify a wave of new oil and gas infrastructure in a world that wants to reach net zero emissions by 2050.”

President Biden’s approach to the climate crisis is nothing short of hypocritical. While the president’s rhetoric aligns with global climate promises, his administration has approved massive fossil fuel projects.

Of all countries in the world, the United States is the world’s top oil and gas producer and exporter, and is planning the largestexpansionin oil and gas production over the next decade. This year alone, Biden approvedthe Willow oil project in Alaskaand multiple LNG export facilities, and his administration put itssupportbehind the Mountain Valley fracked gas pipeline, skipping important permitting processes meant to protect people and the environment, betraying communities and his voters.

President Biden has even backed policies that gut bedrock environmental laws that protect communities from fossil fuel pollution.

At the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, President Biden joined 38 other countries and financial institutions inpromisingto end international public finance for fossil fuels by the end of 2022 and to instead prioritise public finance for clean energy. At the G7 leader’s summit in 2021, a near-identical commitment was adopted, bringing Japan, one of the world’s largest fossil financiers, onboard, and this year the G7 committed to report on progress by the end of 2023. If the United States followed through on its promise, they could shift$3.7bnannually out of fossil fuels on average, increasing their international renewable energy public finance by five times.

But instead of keeping its commitment, the Biden administration continues to approve new public funding for fossil fuel expansion abroad. While Canada, the United Kingdom, and France have published policies keeping their promises to stop international funding for fossil fuels, the United States hasrefused to publish a policy.

In May, the Biden administration approved almost$100min export finance for expanding an Indonesian oil refinery, neglecting the agreed end of 2022 deadline for ending such support. Just a month ago, the US development finance corporation (DFC) pledged half a billion dollars to support LNG imports in Poland and gas infrastructure in South Africa. Most recently in July, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) – the official export credit agency of the US – insured$400min revolving credit facilities for global commodities trader Trafigura, allowing them to purchase liquefied natural gas (LNG) from US exporters to sell primarily to European buyers. And more is on the docket – the United States is currently considering export finance for a controversialLNG projectin Papua New Guinea.

The US breaking its promise is particularly unhelpful now that a huge diplomatic opportunity is opening up to advance oil and gas export finance restrictions at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

More than half of OECD countries, including the United States, signed onto the COP26 commitment to end international public finance for fossil fuels, creating strong foundations for a progressive member to table a proposal for oil and gas restrictions and kick off negotiations on the topic. This is an urgent matter. OECD members still provide$41bnannually in export support to fossil fuel projects, five times their clean energy support.

Ironically, the United States was the country championing efforts to secure OECD coal finance restrictions back in 2015. Now it risks being an obstacle rather than a leader at the OECD.

At a time when we must rapidly and equitably phase out fossil fuels, it is alarming to see Biden consistently breaking their climate commitments and pushing for the global expansion of LNG and oil, as well as holding back progress at the UNSG Climate Ambition Summit and the OECD. Every new fossil fuel project is incompatible with a liveable future.

As the world’s biggest historic polluter, the United States has a responsibility to lead a global just transition away from fossil fuels. Biden can make the choice to lead this moment and succeed. Voters will not ignore Biden’s disastrous climate track record unless he starts keeping his climate promises and paves the way for a cleaner, safer and more equitable future with cheaper energy bills and good jobs.

We call on President Biden to fulfil his duty to the American people, the international community, and communities whose lives and wellbeing are impacted by the dirty fossil fuel projects he has been backing. On Sunday, September 17 people will be marching through New York City with these demands at the UNSG Climate Ambition Summit. It’s time for Biden to listen to our voices and end the era of fossil fuels.

Joe biden,"US, France pledge support as Biden warns Russia ‘will not stop’ at Ukraine","The United States and France have both reaffirmed support for Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s invasion during a meeting in the French capital.

Speaking at a joint news conference at the Presidential Elysee Palace in Paris on Saturday, President Joe Bidenwarnedthat Vladimir Putin would “not stop” at Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron, in turn, hailed his US counterpart’s loyalty to Europe.

“All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen,” Biden said during his state visit to France. “The United States is standing strong with Ukraine. We will not, I say it again, walk away.”

Macron then told Biden in front of reporters: “I thank you, Mr President, for being the president of the world’s number one power but doing it with the loyalty of a partner who likes and respects the Europeans.”

The US president has been in France since Wednesday, taking part in commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of theD-Day landingsthat changed the course of World War II.

On Friday, both Biden and Macron met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris, pledging support for Ukraine.

In a statement released by the White House on Saturday, the French and US leaders said they agreed that wider security across the Atlantic was at stake in Russia’s war.

“France and the United States co-chair the artillery coalition at the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and intend to take new steps to provide the necessary support to Ukraine in the current phase and in the longer term,” the statement said, referring to a coalition of about 50 countries that meet regularly to discuss Ukraine’s security needs.

The US and France also reaffirmed their commitments to the “continued provision of political, security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine”, the statement said.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Former US Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker said that Washington and Paris both seek “to make sure that Ukraine survives as a sovereign, independent European democracy”.

He added the countries are also unified in their desire to halt “Putin’s ideology of re-establishing an empire and denying the existence of the Ukrainian people”.

However, the former diplomat said that the nations differ on how to carry out their goals.

“The US has been very cautious, has been very concerned about escalation and very concerned about poking Putin,” Volker said.

“Macron, more recently, has been pushing the envelope. He’s been talking about what more can be done to help Ukraine, including the possibility of helping regulate their air defences by having some trainers on the ground in Ukraine.”

Macron on Friday said he had discussed such a plan with NATO leaders, with some agreeing to join the effort. That would be finalised “in the days ahead”, he said.

The US has been staunchly opposed to having any of its personnel on the ground in Ukraine, a position that has remained unchanged since Russia invaded its neighbour in February 2022.







Biden and Macron also discussed their support for using interest earned from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine, a move that has been met with scepticism from some European G7 allies.

Ukrainian forces, long outgunned by Russia, have struggled to maintain pressure against Russia along the 1,000-kilometre (621-mile) front line in recent months. That has come as some support from Western allies has flagged.

Still, Kyiv received a boost in recent weeks, with France and Germany at the end of May allowing Ukraine to use the weapons they provided against targets on Russian soil.

The US soon followed suit,giving Ukraine permissionto use weapons provided by Washington in Russian territory near Kharkiv.

In Paris on Friday, Biden apologised to Zelenskyy for previous delays in Washington’s aid to Kyiv, stressing that the US is “not going to walk away” from supporting Ukraine.

“We’re still in – completely, thoroughly,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/8/us-france-pledge-support-as-biden-warns-russia-will-not-stop-at-ukraine,POSITIVE,0.99399334192276
Joe biden,"Biden, Xi seek to ‘manage differences’ in Bali meeting","United States President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have opened theirfirst in-person meetingsince the former took office nearly two years ago, aiming to “manage” differences between the superpowers as they compete for global influence amid increasing economic and security tensions.

Xi and Biden greeted each other with a handshake at a luxury resort on Indonesia’s Bali island on Monday, where they are attending theGroup of 20 (G20) summitof large economies, before they sat down for what was expected to be a conversation lasting several hours.

“As the leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation,” Biden said to open the meeting.

Xi said he hoped they would “chart the right course for the China-US relationship” and that he was prepared for a “candid and in-depth exchange of views” with Biden.

Reporting from the G20 summit, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays said there was little hope that anything particularly substantial would come out of the meeting.

“It’s about two leaders who know each other from the past, getting back to knowing each other again, and building a little more trust to try to remove some of the tension from the relationship,” Bays said.

“Both sides are saying they have got to find a way to work together. The White House briefing said they need red lines and have to work out what each other’s limits are on key issues.”

The two leaders entered the highly anticipated meeting with bolstered political standing at home.

Democrats triumphantly held onto control of the US Senate, with a chance to boost their ranks by one in a run-off election in Georgia next month, while Xi was awarded anunprecedentedthird five-year term in October by the Communist Party’s National Congress, a break with tradition.

“We have very little misunderstanding,” Biden told reporters in Cambodia on Sunday, where he participated in a gathering of Southeast Asian nations before leaving for Indonesia. “We just got to figure out where the red lines are and … what are the most important things to each of us going into the next two years.”

Biden added: “His circumstance has changed, to state the obvious, at home.” The president said of his own situation: “I know I’m coming in stronger.”

Relations have grown more strained under successive US administrations, as economic, trade, human rights and security differences have come to the fore.

As president, Biden has repeatedly taken China to task for human rights abuses against the Uighur people and other ethnic minorities, crackdowns on democracy activists in Hong Kong, coercive trade practices, military provocations against self-ruled Taiwan and differences over Russia’s prosecution of its war against Ukraine.

Chinese officials have largelyrefrainedfrom public criticism of Russia’s war, although Beijing has avoided direct support, such as supplying arms.

Taiwan has emerged as one of the most contentious issues between Washington and Beijing.

Multiple times in his presidency, Biden has said the US would defend the island – which China has eyed for eventual unification – in case of a Beijing-led invasion.

Tensions flared even higher when US House Speaker Nancy Pelosivisited Taiwanin August, prompting China to retaliate with military drills and the firing of ballistic missiles into nearby waters.

The Biden administration also blocked exports of advanced computer chips to China last month – a national security move that bolsters US competition against Beijing. Chinese officials quickly condemned the restrictions.

Before the meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning had said China was committed to peaceful coexistence but would firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.

“It is important that the US work together with China to properly manage differences, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation, and bring China-US relations back to the right track of sound and steady development,” she said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/14/biden-xi-seek-to-manage-our-differences-in-meeting,POSITIVE,0.993224561214447
Joe biden,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.

Al Jazeera is an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government.
