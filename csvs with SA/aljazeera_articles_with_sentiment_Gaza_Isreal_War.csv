Gaza Isreal War,Netanyahu’s war choices fuel discord in Israel over captives’ fate in Gaza,"To prioritise the release of the captives in Gaza, or to continue fighting what critics are calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “forever war” – that is the question increasingly dividing Israel.

Israel’s government, laser-focused on the idea of a total victory against Hamas in Gaza, appears to be opting for the latter.

And that is only increasing the criticism Netanyahu has received since October 2023, firstly for his government’s failure to stop the October 7 attack, and then for failing to end a now 19-month war, or provide a clear vision for what the “day after” in Gaza will look like.

Netanyahu’s decision in March to unilaterally end a ceasefire instead of continuing with an agreement that would have brought home the remaining captives has widened the cracks within Israeli society, as opponents realised that the likelihood of the captives leaving Gaza alive was becoming more remote.

In recent weeks, a wave of open letter writing from within military units has emerged protesting the government’s priorities.

The discontent has also gained traction with the public.Earlier this month, thousands of Israelis gatheredoutside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv to protest against Netanyahu’s decision to call up a further 60,000 reservists as part of his escalation against the bombed out and besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where his forces have already killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children.

In mid-April, current and former members of the air force, considered one of Israel’s elite units, also released a letter, claiming the war served the “political and personal interests” of Netanyahu, “and not security ones”.

Prompted by the air force, similar protests came from members of the navy, elite units within the military and Israel’s foreign security agency, Mossad.







Political and personal interests

Accusations that Netanyahu is manipulating the war for his own personal ends predate the breaking of the ceasefire.

In the minds of his critics, the longer the war continues, the longer Netanyahu feels he can defend himself against the numerous threats to his position and even his freedom.

In addition to facing trial on numerous counts ofcorruption dating back to 2019, he also faces calls to hold an inquiry into the government’s political failings before the October 7 attack.

Netanyahu also faces accusations that members of his office have allegedly been taking payment from Qatar – the Gulf state has previously dismissed the allegations as a “smear campaign” intended to hinder efforts to mediate an end to the conflict.

The continuation of the war allows Netanyahu to distract from those issues, while maintaining a coalition with far-right parties who have made it clear that any end to the war without total victory – which increasingly appears to include the ethnic cleansing of Gaza – would result in their departure from government, and Netanyahu’s likely fall.

And so there are questions about whether Netanyahu’s announcement of a further escalation in Gaza, including the occupation of territory and displacement of its population, will mark an end to the conflict, or simply bog Israel down in the kind of forever war that has so far been to Netanyahu’s benefit.

‘I don’t know if they’re capable of occupying the territory,” former US Special Forces commander, Colonel Seth Krummrich of international security firm Global Guardian told Al Jazeera, “Gaza is just going to soak up people, and that’s before you even think about guarding northern Israel, confronting Iran or guarding the Israeli street,” he said, warning of the potential shortfall in reservists.

“It’s also competing with a tide of growing [domestic] toxicity. When soldiers don’t return home, or don’t go, that’s going to tear at the fabric of Israeli society. It plays out at every dinner table.”







Staying at home

Israeli media reports suggest that part of that toxicity is playing out in the number of reservists simply not showing up for duty.

The majority of those refusing service are thought to be “grey refusers”. That is, reservists with no ideological objection to the mass killings in Gaza, but rather ones exhausted by repeated tours, away from their families and jobs to support a war with no clear end.

Official numbers of reservists refusing duty are unknown. However, in mid-March, the Israeli national broadcaster, Kan, ran a report disputing official numbers, which claimed that more than 80 percent of those called up for duty had attended, suggesting that the actual figure was closer to 60 percent.

“There has been a steady increase in refusal among reservists,” a spokesperson for the organisation New Profile, which supports people refusing enlistment, said. “However, we often see sharp spikes in response to specific shifts in Israeli government policy, such as the violation of the most recent ceasefire or public statements by officials indicating that the primary objective of the military campaign is no longer the return of hostages and ‘destruction of Hamas’, as initially claimed, but rather the occupation of Gaza, and its ethnic cleansing.”

Also unaddressed is growing public discontent over the ultra-religious Haredi community, whose eight-decade exemption frommilitary service was deemed illegalby the Supreme Court in June of last year.

Despite the shortfall in reservists reporting for duty and others having experienced repeated deployments, in April, the Supreme Court requested an explanation from Netanyahu – who relies upon Haredi support to maintain his coalition – as to why its ruling had not been fully implemented or enforced.







Throughout the war, Netanyahu’s escalations, while often resisted by the captives’ families and their allies, have been cheered on and encouraged by his allies among the far-right, many of whom claim a biblical right to the homes and land of Palestinians.

The apparent conflict between the welfare of the captives and the “total victory” promised by Netanyahu has run almost as long as the conflict itself, with each moment of division seemingly strengthening the prime minister’s position through the critical support of the ultranationalist elements of his cabinet.

Netanyahu’s position has led to conflict with politicians, including his own former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. While Gallant wasn’t opposed to the war in principle – his active support for Netanyahu eventually led to him joining Netanyahu in facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes – his prioritisation of the captives put him at odds with the prime minister.

The divide over priorities has meant that civility between the government and the captives’ families has increasingly gone out the window, with Netanyahu generally avoiding meeting families with loved ones still captive in Gaza, and far-right politicians engaging in shouting matches with them during meetings in parliament.

Division within Israeli society was not new, Professor Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House told Al Jazeera, “but wars and conflicts deepen them”.

“Now we have a situation where some people have served anywhere up to 400 days in the army [as reservists], while others are refusing to serve at all and exploiting their political power within the coalition to do so,” Mekelberg added.

“Elsewhere, there are ministers on the extreme right talking about ‘sacrificing’ the hostages for military gain,” something Mekelberg said many regarded as running counter to much of the founding principles of the country and the Jewish faith.

“There’s such toxicity in public discourse,” Mekelberg continued, “We see toxicity against anyone who criticises the war or the prime minister, division between the secular and the religious, and then even divisions within the religious movements.”

Gaza Isreal War,No sense in Gaza ceasefire talks amid Israel’s ‘hunger war’: Hamas,"Hamas will no longer engage in ceasefire negotiations with Israel, seeing no point in doing so “as long as the hunger war and extermination war” continues on the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian group’s senior official.

Basem Naim told the AFP news agency on Tuesday that the international community must pressure the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the “crimes of hunger, thirst, and killings” in Gaza.

“There is no sense in engaging in talks or considering new ceasefire proposals as long as the hunger war and extermination war continue in the Gaza Strip,” he said.

Naim’s remarks came a day afterNetanyahu saidthe population of the enclave “will be moved” in an upcoming expanded military operation by Israeli forces that would reportedly entail “the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories”.

Nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced multiple times since Israel began its war on the Palestinian enclave in October 2023.

The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip has grown increasingly dire since a total blockade was imposed by Israel on March 2, causing widespread food shortages as Israel carries out deadly attacks across the enclave.

Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said Palestinians are “struggling to find food to feed their children” with some “forced to eat expired or rotten food”, while others cannot find any form of sustenance.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said this week that food supplies in Gaza have now “completely run out” in both local markets and humanitarian distribution centres.

“The population is once again at extreme risk of famine,” the PRCS said in its latest situation update. “There is an inability to meet even the minimum daily needs of over a million displaced people.”

According to the PRCS, only “limited quantities of legumes” are currently being distributed to community kitchens, as all previously stocked aid has been depleted.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) echoed these concerns, calling for the immediate entry of humanitarian aid and warning against its politicisation.

“The level of need among civilians in Gaza right now is overwhelming,” said ICRC spokesperson Christian Cardon.

“Under international humanitarian law, Israel has an obligation to use all means available to ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population under its control are met,” he added.

Awad, 39, who lives in a tent in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, told Al Jazeera on Monday that “Israel has not stopped the war, the killing, the bombing, the destruction, the siege and the starvation – every day – so how can they talk about expanding military operations?

“I call on the world to witness the famine that grows and spreads every day,” he said.

Aya al-Skafy, a resident of Gaza City, told Al Jazeera on Monday that her baby died because of malnutrition and medicine shortages last week.

“She was four months old and weighed 2.8kg [6.2lb]. Because of severe malnutrition, she suffered from blood acidity, liver and kidney failure, and many other complications. Her hair and nails also fell out due to malnutrition.”

According to leaked plans, Israel’s government reportedly wants to severely restrict the way food is distributed in Gaza and is proposing that United States companies take over distribution from the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies.

Under the plan, Palestinian families would be allowed to take one food parcel a week in designated hubs in southern Gaza, and Israel would permit 60 trucks to enter the Gaza Strip every day – just one-tenth of what’s needed, according to experts.

Aid groups in the UN have rejected this plan, saying it’s a pressure tactic to further reinforce control over life-saving supplies.

Gaza Isreal War,How Israel’s war on Gaza is bleeding Egypt’s economy,"Already facing a deep crisis, Egypt’s economy appears poised to take a hit from Israel’s war on Gaza and the spiralling tensions in the Red Sea, analysts have said.

Currently on “life support”, Egypt’s deteriorating economy suffers from growing public debt now at more than 90 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), capital flight and the currency’s fall against the US dollar.









Now, those challenges are being compounded by the war, as it edges closer and closer to Egypt’s border, with a large chunk of Gaza’s population pushed into Rafah, after four months of displacement as a result of Israel’s relentless attacks. Tourism and the Suez Canal are two of Egypt’s major sources of foreign exchange.

Egypt’s pyramids, museums, resorts and monuments attract visitors from all over the world and have long made tourism a major source of national income. In 2022, roughlythreemillion Egyptians worked in the tourism industry.

Before Israel’s war on Gaza erupted, Egypt’s tourism sector was already struggling to recover from COVID-19. But it appeared to be rebounding. The Gaza war and the Red Sea crisis could batter revenue prospects from this industry. According to S&P Global Ratings, Egypt’s tourism revenues are set to experience a 10-30 percent fall from last year, which could cost the country 4-11 percent of its foreign exchange reserves and shrink GDP.

“The conflict’s proximity to the Sinai peninsula has led to a sharp decline in tourism, which brought in…$13.63bn in revenue during the 2022-23 fiscal year,” Amr Salah Mohamed​, an adjunct lecturer at George Mason University, told Al Jazeera.

“Although the full extent of the damage to Egyptian tourism from the ongoing conflict is difficult to quantify so far, early indications, such as a 25 percent drop in early November bookings, suggest a substantial downturn that is likely to continue if the conflict persists,” he added.

Since November, Egypt has been grappling with the economic impact of Houthi missile and drone attacks against Israel-linked commercial vessels in the Red Sea, which has been the Houthis’ response to Israel’s war on Gaza.

A consequence of these strikes along the shortest trade route linking Asia to Europe through the Suez Canal has been many shipping companiesreroutingtheir vessels around the Cape of Good Hope.

In the 2022-23 fiscal year, the Suez Canal brought in $9.4bn of revenue for Egypt. In the first 11 days of this year, revenue from the Suez Canalplummetedby 40 percent compared with the same period in the previous year.

That damage has only increased since then. Egyptian authorities said revenue in January from the Suez Canal had fallen 50 percent since the start of the year, compared with the same period in 2023.

Since October 7, Egypt’s gas economy has also suffered greatly. Two days after the Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel, the Israeli defence establishmentorderedthe temporary halting of extractions from the Tamar gas field, located 25km (15 miles) from Israel’s southern coastal city of Ashdod.

Egypt is home to the Eastern Mediterranean’s only two gasliquefaction facilities. Israel exports its gas – including from Tamar – to Egypt, where it is turned into LNG and exported to other markets, in particular, Europe.

Because of the war, Egypt’s re-exports of gas fell by more than50percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with that same period in 2022. This dynamic has highlighted Egypt’s economic dependence on Israel, which constitutes a huge vulnerability for Cairo at a time when tension is high in the region due to the Gaza war.

The fate of the 1.4 million Palestinians taking shelter in Rafah is also a source of unease in Egypt.

The government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi wants to prevent the influx of displaced Palestinians into the Sinai peninsula to escape Israel’s destruction across Gaza. There are already nine million refugees in Egypt, and Cairo has made clear it will not support any move that could amount to the permanent displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, which many experts fear is Israel’s game plan.

Security concerns over the presence of Palestinian fighters in Sinai, and the effects of their planned attacks against Israel on relations between Cairo and Tel Aviv, are a factor for Egypt. Economic challenges also help explain why Egypt views any forcible expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza into the Sinai as crossing a red line. Since Sudan’s conflict erupted 10 months ago, 450,000 Sudanese refugees have crossed Egypt’s southern border, which has already strained Egypt’s troubled economy.

Against this backdrop, Egypt has begunconstructing a walltwo miles west of the Egypt-Gaza border, potentially to forestall such a scenario. “There are those of us who fear that Israelis will destroy the existing Egyptian border fence so that they can push Gazans into Sinai,” said Patrick Theros, the former US ambassador to Qatar, in an interview with Al Jazeera.

“Egypt is building a second border wall lightly inside Egyptian territory to serve as a deterrent to the Israelis. Given Netanyahu’s desperate need to stay in power and avoid going to jail, the deterrent may not work,” he said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose popularity is at a record low domestically. Many analysts have argued that he needs the war to continue to avoid being removed from office. Netanyahu faces corruption cases.

“Washington’s irrational refusal to stop him may encourage Netanyahu to extend the fighting into Sinai, even if it ends the peace treaty with Egypt,” Theros said.

Last month, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with the Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Maait in Washington to pledge US support for the Egyptian economy and reforms.

At the same time, there were discussions about augmenting Egypt’s $3bn loan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help it cope with the war in Gaza and the Red Sea security crisis. The main elements of the economic reform package include the Egyptian governmentselling stakesin dozens of state-owned enterprises,subsidy reductions, moving towards a flexible exchange rate, and making the military’s role in the national economy more transparent.

Yet, analysts caution, the war in Gaza and the Red Sea security crisis coming in the aftermath of the geopolitical shocks caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine two years ago will probably make Egyptian officials more reluctant to implement some economic reforms.

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Ryan Bohl, a Middle East and North African analyst at the risk intelligence company RANE, said the IMF would need to be considerate of the multiple pressures facing Egyptian policymakers when making demands of them.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/24/how-israels-war-on-gaza-is-bleeding-egypts-economy,NEGATIVE,0.8729037046432495
Gaza Isreal War,Israel calling up tens of thousands of reservists to expand war on Gaza,"The Israeli military will call up tens of thousands of reservists to expand the country’s assault on the besieged Gaza Strip, army chief Eyal Zamir says.

He made the announcement on Sunday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to continue the war despite growing calls from inside Israel for a deal that would bring home Israeli captives held in Gaza and end the war, which has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians.

“This week, we are sending tens of thousands of draft orders to our reserve personnel to intensify and expand our action in Gaza. We are increasing the pressure to return our people [held captive in Gaza] and defeat Hamas,” Zamir said, adding that the Israeli military would “operate in additional areas and destroy all of [Hamas’s] infrastructure above and below ground”.

The military chief made the announcement during a visit to the Atlit naval base on Israel’s northern Mediterranean coast.

The announcement came before a Netanyahu-chaired security cabinet meeting to discuss an expansion of the war in Gaza, which began in October 2023 and has decimated the Palestinian enclave.

A growing movement within Israel has called for an end to the war, and an increasing number of reservists are ignoring call-ups.

Two government officials told the Reuters news agency that the cabinet would also discuss the possible resumption of aid to Gaza as humanitarian groups warn of increased starvation in the territory since Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2.

Israel continues to face widespread global outrage over the conduct of its war in Gaza, which has shattered the territory’s infrastructure as well as its healthcare system and displaced the vast majority of its 2.3 million residents at least once since the war began.

Far-right Israeli National Security MinisterItamar Ben-Gvir, in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, said he wanted to see a “powerful” expansion of the war but did not disclose details as to what new plans might entail.

“We need to increase the intensity and continue until we achieve total victory. We must win a total victory,” he said. He demanded that Israel bomb “the food and electricity supplies” in Gaza.

Leading humanitarian groups, including the Red Cross, have warned that the humanitarian response in Gaza is on the verge of “total collapse” and Palestinians face a “daily struggle to survive” amid bombardment and the crippling blockade.

United Nations agencies have said truck convoys carrying aid are building up at the border and have not been allowed into the enclave, where a famine is looming.

Israeli officials claim an expanded military offensive would pressure Hamas into releasing the 59 remaining captives, but critics argue it further endangers their lives. Israel ending the fragile ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives, on March 18 has not led to any more releases.

The reserve call-ups are going out as Netanyahupromised to respondto Yemen’s Houthis after the rebels fired a missile that struck a road at Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport, wounding six people and prompting several major airlines to suspend flights.

Netanyahu said the response will take place “at a time and place of our choosing”.

The Houthis have said their fighters carried out the assault “in support of the oppressed Palestinian people” and to counter Israel’s “crime of genocide” in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/4/israel-calls-up-thousands-of-reservists-to-expand-war-on-gaza,NEGATIVE,0.7852980494499207

Gaza Isreal War,Israel’s war on Gaza – six relentless months of death and destruction,"It has been six months since Israel launched its brutal assault on the Gaza Strip on October 7.

Israel shows no sign of stopping, as its allies continue to provide it with more weapons to use on Palestinians along with political support, and mediated talks have not led to a ceasefire.

The war on Gaza, Israel says, is in retaliation for attacks on Israeli territory by armed groups, led by Hamas’s Qassam Brigades, from Gaza which killed 1,139 people and took about 250 captive.

Let’s take a look at the toll the Israeli attacks have taken on Gaza.

At least 33,137 Palestinians have beenkilledby the Israeli army in Gaza since the start of the war on October 7, the Ministry of Health in Gaza says.

Thousands more are missing under the rubble of collapsed buildings and infrastructure, and are presumed dead.



Children and women comprise the overwhelming majority of those killed, with Save the Children saying more than 13,800 children have been killed.

UNICEF, the United Nations fund for children, estimated that at least 17,000 Palestinian children are currently unaccompanied or separated from their parents in Gaza.

At least 75,815 people have been injured in Israeli attacks since the start of the war – about four out of every 100 people in Gaza.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said this week that some 1,000 children in Gaza have lost one or both of their legs.

Dozens of people are still killed and injured every day amid relentless Israeli attacks.

The humanitarian situation in Gaza has grown significantly worse in 2024 as the Israeli army blocks the arrival of aid and has effectively imposedstarvationas a weapon of war.

Nearly all 2.3 million people trapped in Gaza now face starvation, with the UN saying famine will take hold in various parts of Gaza by May.

Northern Gaza, which was the first to be decimated by an Israeli ground invasion, is the worst-hit – Israel continues to severely restrict access to the north, blocking routes and subjecting aid convoys to delays or cancellations.

Babies and young children have died from dehydration and malnutrition in northern Gaza, but Israel is still blocking many humanitarian missions.

Last week, Israeli forcesdeliberately killed seven foreign aid workersin three targeted, consecutive strikes on a convoy of cars over a stretch of 2.3km (1.4 miles), prompting some aid organisations to suspend services.

The Israeli military ordered Palestinians to “go south” from the start of the war as its ground forces invaded Gaza from the north.

Nobody has been able to return to their homes in northern Gaza since then as Israel has established a military corridor cutting the Strip in half.

Some 1.9 million people, or more than 80 percent of Gaza’s population, have been internallydisplaced. Most are sheltering in UN installations such as schools and hospitals, nevertheless, more than 400 have been killed and at least 1,400 injured in those places.

More than 1.5 million people are now crammed into Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city on the border with Egypt. Many have been forced to stay in makeshift camps or the streets, exposed to Israeli air attacks.

Israel has insisted it will invade Rafah by land as well.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says more than 350 Israeli military attacks have targeted its buildings, with 161 installations damaged. The highest number of UN staff in history – 176 – have been killed in Gaza since October 7.

The war has damaged or destroyed approximately 62 percent of all homes in Gaza – 290,820 housing units – leaving more than a million people without homes.

The$18.5bn in damageestimated by the World Bank and the UN has also been to public service infrastructure, with 26 million tonnes of debris and rubble left by the destruction.



Damage has been most extensive in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where Israeli ground and air attacks destroyed thousands of homes and infrastructure in a stated effort to combat “terrorists”.

Eight of every 10 schools in Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to UNICEF. As many as 625,000 students have no access to education.

The Israeli army has focused its attacks on hospitals across Gaza despite their protection under international law, claiming Hamas is operating within and underneath them.

All hospitals have suffered critical damage, with only 10 out of 36 able to function partially but they are increasingly overburdened.

A two-week-long siege in and around al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza,left it heavily damaged and burnedby last week. The Israeli army killed at least 400 people at the compound during its siege and arrested hundreds more.

An acute shortage of medicine, along with exhausted and starving healthcare professionals, means most patients are unable to receive treatment in Gaza. Many operations and amputations have had to be performed without anaesthetic.

The Israeli army has killed the largest number of journalists of any modern conflict and detained more than 24.

On March 18, Al Jazeera correspondentIsmail al-Ghoulwas arrested for 12 hours and beaten by Israeli forces in al-Shifa Hospital.

Before that, on January 7, Al Jazeera journalist Hamza Dahdouh, son of Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, waskilled by an Israeli missile in Khan Younis. Hamza was in a vehicle nearal-Mawasiwith another journalist, Mustafa Thuraya, who was also killed in the attack.

On December 15, 2023, Al Jazeera cameramanSamer Abudaqawas hit in an Israeli drone attack that also injured Wael Dahdouh, in Khan Younis, Gaza.

Abudaqa bled to death over four hours as emergency workers were unable to reach him because the Israeli army would not let them.

The Committee to Protect Journalists puts the number of journalists killed at 90, with the Government Media Office in Gaza saying some 140 have been killed.

Last week, an Israeli strike targeted a journalists’ tent in the courtyard of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, killing at least four people and wounding multiple journalists.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/7/israels-war-on-gaza-six-relentless-months-of-death-and-destruction,NEGATIVE,0.9973220229148865
Gaza Isreal War,"Columbia, NYU, Yale on the boil over Israel’s war on Gaza: What’s going on?","Top United States university campuses, including those of Yale, New York University (NYU) andColumbia University, are on edge amid arrests of pro-Palestinian demonstrators on Monday and mounting tension between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protesters over the war in Gaza.

On Sunday, a prominent rabbi linked to New York’s Columbia University and its affiliated Barnard College, Elie Buechler, urged Jewish students at the institution to stay home due to “extreme anti-Semitism”on the campus.

Columbia’s President Nemat “Minouche” Shafik announced in an official statement that all classes will be held virtually on Monday and that faculty and staff who can work remotely should do so. Monday marks Passover, a major Jewish holiday.

“Over the past days, there have been too many examples of intimidating and harassing behavior on our campus. Anti-Semitic language, like any other language that is used to hurt and frighten people, is unacceptable and appropriate action will be taken,” Shafik said in a statement.

On Monday, those tensions extended to midtown Manhattan, where the NYU campus is based, and to the Yale campus in New Haven, Connecticut.

From Yale, 60 people, including at least 47 student protesters, were arrested for trespassing after they blocked traffic around campus, according to a statement by Yale University President Peter Salovey on Monday.

Protesters were also arrested from NYU. On Monday night, NYU released a statement saying, “The police urged those on the plaza to leave peacefully, but ultimately made a number of arrests.”

NYU’s student-run newspaper Washington Square News published an update at 9:30pm local time (01:00 GMT) saying “all visible protesters have either dispersed or been arrested,” adding that the arrested protesters were kept in zip ties and the tents in the encampment were completely removed.

The NYPD moved in on an encampment in NYU’s Gould Plaza, preventing additional people from joining the protest. Several NYU students and faculty members were arrested by hundreds of policemen on charges of trespassing, Helga Tawil-Souri, an associate professor of Middle East and Islamic studies at NYU told Al Jazeera as she stood outside a police station, awaiting the release of several students and faculty members. “I don’t know how we trespass on our own campus.”

Tawil-Souri said the protest was peaceful. “I’ve been at NYU for almost 20 years and I’ve seen a number of protests happening. I don’t think I have ever seen a crackdown of this nature.”

Earlier, on April 18, New York police arrestedmore than 100 pro-Palestinian protestersfrom Columbia on charges of trespassing. Several students were also suspended from Columbia and Barnard – which sits across Broadway from Columbia’s main campus in Morningside Heights – including Isra Hirsi, the daughter of Ilhan Omar, a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives.







A range of student groups are behind the protests. At Columbia, the so-called “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” has been organised by the student-led coalition, Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace.

The protesters are calling for Columbia to divest from corporations that profit from Israel’s war on Gaza. The CUAD website lists additional demands, calling for more financial transparency about Columbia’s investments, and the severing of academic ties and collaborations with Israeli universities and programmes. The groups are also calling for a complete ceasefire in Gaza.

In NYU, the encampment was organised by the NYU Palestine Solidarity Coalition, a newly formed on-campus group, comprising students and faculty from Students for Justice in Palestine, Faculty for Justice in Palestine, Law Students for Justice in Palestine, Shut it Down NYU, Jews Against Zionism and more than 20 other on-campus groups.

The NYU Alumni for Palestine website details a list of demands in an open letter to NYU’s leadership which was signed by 2,410 alumni. These include the condemnation of the killing of Palestinian civilians, the protection of students and faculty who are speaking up for Palestine against harassment, and divestment from “companies and institutions active in the Israeli occupation and genocide in Palestine”.

Additionally, the alumni letter calls on NYU leadership to shut down NYU’s Tel Aviv campus which “bars Palestinian students, faculty and affiliates from accessing academic opportunities at the site because of their ethnicity,” contradicting “NYU’s principles of academic freedom and egalitarianism”. The letter calls on leadership to re-evaluate the involvement of NYU, particularly its Tandon School of Engineering, in arms research and development, and to cease collaboration with arms manufacturers.

The encampment at Yale has been continuing since Friday, with protesters demanding that Yale divest from military weapons manufacturers.

At least 34,000 people have died in Gaza as a result of Israel’s unrelenting bombardment of the beleaguered enclave and its ground assault. Restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza have also pushed the enclave to the brink ofstarvation.

When I speak on campus, I ask what % of the pro-Palestine protesters are Jewish. Usually, Jews are overrepresented. Sometimes they're the largest identity group. Maybe folks calling for cracking down on protesters in the name of Jewish safety should consider their safety too

— Peter Beinart (@PeterBeinart)April 22, 2024



Some protesters have been accused ofanti-Semitismand harassment of Jewish students at the university.

On Sunday, those allegations gathered further steam after footage on social media appeared to show pro-Palestine activists outside the Columbia campus telling pro-Israel students to “go back to Poland”. One activist said thatOctober 7“will happen not one more time, not five more times, not 10 more times, not 100 more times, not 1,000 more times, but 10,000 times”, referring to theHamas attackson southern Israel that killed 1,139 people. Another activist can be heard saying that October 7 will “be every day for you”.

A chapter of an international Orthodox Jewish movement, Chabad at Columbia University, released a statement saying that protesters also told Jewish students, “You have no culture”, “All you do is colonise” and to “Go back to Europe”.

""Never forget the 7th of October. That will happen not one more time, not five more times, not 10…100…1000…10,000…The 7th of October is going to be every day for you.""

Yet another video shows a student protester at a gathering inside Columbia saying: “Let it be known that it was the Al-Aqsa Flood that put the global Intifada back on the table again.”

Hamas had called its October 7 attacks on Israel “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood”.

In a statement on Sunday, CUAD distanced itself from what it said were “media distractions focusing on inflammatory individuals who do not represent us”.

“At universities across the nation, our movement is united in valuing every human life,” the statement said.

CUAD has insisted that its members “have been misidentified by a politically motivated mob”.

In the statement, the group said: “We have been doxxed in the press, arrested by the NYPD [New York Police Department], and locked out of our homes by the university. We have knowingly put ourselves in danger because we can no longer be complicit in Columbia funnelling our tuition dollars and grant funding into companies that profit from death.”

Meanwhile, student demonstrators at other US Universities, including the University of California, Berkeley, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan, Emerson College and Tufts have also established protest encampments.







Days before the latest escalation in tensions on campus, leaders of Columbia University, including Shafik,appearedbefore a committee in the US Congress to face questions about the alleged anti-Semitism on campus.

Before that, Shafik had pledged on April 17 to take firm action to combat anti-Semitism. She said Columbia had already suspended 15 students and had six on disciplinary probation.

“These are more disciplinary actions that have been taken probably in the last decade at Columbia. And I promise you, from the messages I’m hearing from students, they are getting the message that violations of our policies will have consequences,” Shafik said.

Yet pro-Israel students and faculty have criticised the Columbia administration for not doing enough to make them feel safe – and have called for Shafik’s resignation. Pro-Palestinian protesters too, have accused Columbia of stifling their freedom of expression.

In November, Columbia suspended Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. In March, the New York Civil Liberties Union said it would sue Columbia over the suspensions.

In January, the university banned a group of individuals from campus after they were accused of being involved in spraying pro-Palestinian protesters with afoul-smelling chemical.

On Monday, the protest in Columbia continued as hundreds of people, including students and faculty, also condemned the arrest and suspension of students. Criticising Shafik’s decision to call riot police to disperse students earlier, the protesters demanded that Shafik resign.

Shafik also faces pressure to resign from the other side. Columbia Jewish Alumni Association made an X post on Monday, which said: “CJAA demands that Shafik ENFORCE RULES, CALL IN NYPD, RESTORE ORDER… or RESIGN.”







In a statement on Sunday to commemorate Passover, US PresidentJoe Bidencondemned what he described as “blatant” anti-Semitism at Columbia University, calling it “reprehensible and dangerous” and saying “it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country”.

This was after the White House released a separate statement calling out “physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community”.

Condemnation of the Sunday protest also came from New York City Mayor Eric Adams and New York State Governor Kathy Hochul.

UN Special Rapporteur for Palestine Francesca Albanese wrote an X post on Monday highlighting the arrests made by Columbia University and the alleged targeting of students who showed solidarity with Palestine in European universities.

Gaza Isreal War,Before Israel’s war on Gaza: Other times US campuses became battlegrounds,"From coast to coast, university students in the United States are protesting against Israel’s war on Gaza, despite threats of suspension andarrest.

WithColumbia Universityat the heart of the movement, institutes including Harvard, Yale, Tufts, Northwestern and several campuses in the University of Texas system have seen students set up encampments, demanding their institutions divest from companies they say are enabling the brutal war on Gaza.

More than 34,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of war onOctober 7.



This is not the first time that university students in the US have staged protests on campus. However, protesters and observers say that the crackdown on the student encampments has been particularly intense this time.

“One of the things that’s really striking is that in comparison to the 1960s, we are seeing much less aggression and radicalism of tactics on the part of the students,” said Angus Johnston, historian of American student activism in the history department at Hostos Community College in New York.

“We have seen very little physical injury or property damage. The, encampments are outside rather than for the most part taking over buildings. Compared to the protests of the 60s, particularly the late 60s, these protests are actually very, very mild. And yet they’re being met with a really harsh in many cases, governmental and administration.”

Helga Tawil-Souri, an associate professor of Middle East and Islamic studies at NYU told Al Jazeera the NYU protest on Gaza was peaceful as she stood outside a police station, awaiting the release of several students and faculty members. “I’ve been at NYU for almost 20 years and I’ve seen a number of protests happening. I don’t think I have ever seen a crackdown of this nature.”

Here are some of the key protests that US university students have led on campuses, and what they achieved:

In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled that state-sanctioned segregation in schools was unconstitutional.Racially segregatedpublic spaces had been in operation from 1896 up until that ruling.

On February 1, 1960, four Black students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, who earned the name the “Greensboro Four”, initiated peaceful sit-ins at “whites-only” lunch counters, starting with Woolworth’s in Greensboro. The students refused to get up when they were denied service. By February 5, the number of students sitting in had grown to 300. The movement quickly spread to other college towns and public places with both Black and white people joining in.

The sit-in movement was successful and dining facilities began to reintegrate by July 1960. Those protests marked the early success of the civil rights movement. They also led to the creation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which began as an interracial group advocating peaceful protest, in 1960.

In April 1968, students at Columbia University and its affiliate, Barnard College, staged a protest against theVietnam war, which had begun in 1954 and would last until 1975. The protests resulted in students seizing five campus buildings and even briefly taking the dean hostage.

Around a week after the protest began on April 30, about 1,000 officers from the New York City Tactical Patrol Force were called in by Columbia President Grayson L Kirk. The police arrested nearly 700 people on charges of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. In some buildings, the police used force, injuring 148 people.

In the end, the protests forced Columbia to cut ties with a Pentagon institute which was doing research for the Vietnam War and won amnesty for demonstrators who had taken part in the protests. The also managed to stop the construction of a gym on public grounds in nearby Morningside Park, to which local Black Harlem residents would only have have been granted partial access. Columbia’s president and its provost, David B Truman both resigned as a result of the protests.

Students at Harvard also protested against the Vietnam war. On the night of April 9, 1969, a national student activist organisation, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), pinned a list of demands on the door of the Harvard president’s house. The group was were opposed, in particular, to Harvard’s engagement with military policy – Dow Chemicals which supplied Napalm to the military had been invited to Harvard for a recruitment visit in 1967 – as well as the presence of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) on campus. The next day, student protesters occupied the University Hall and were arrested, leading to wider protests and an eight-day strike, according to Harvard magazine.

As a result of the protest, ROTC left the university’s campus.

A year later, on May 4, 1970, the Ohio National Guard shot dead four Kent State University college students, and injured nine others, during a protest by 300 students against the Vietnam war and its expansion into Cambodia. They were also protesting the presence of the National Guard on campus.

The shootings caused outrage and led to more than 4 million students taking part in protests and walk-outs at hundreds more colleges and high schools across the country.

Just 11 days after that incident, on May 15, police opened fire on 100 Black students at Jackson State College, Mississippi, killing two and injuring 12. The students had gathered to protest against white drivers who frequently sped dangerously along a road which bisected the campus shouting racist abuse, rather than the Vietnam war.

In the 1970s and 1980s, public school students in Soweto,South Africastaged protests against mandatory teaching in Afrikaans-language and the overcrowding of schools.

This snowballed into a global movement and, by 1985, American universities such as Columbia and the University of California were calling on their administrators to withdraw investments from companies tied to the apartheid regime in South Africa.

In Columbia, this effort was organised by the Coalition for a Free South Africa (CFSA), which, on April 4, 1985, blockaded the entrance to Columbia’s administrative building, Hamilton Hall.

A judge of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan ordered that the protesters allow access to the hall and, instead, take their protest to a designated area on the steps of Hamilton Hall and in the adjoining quadrangle.

A six-member panel of trustees was formed immediately after the end of the blockade on April 25, to consider divestment – pulling back its investments in companies tied to the apartheid regime. In late August, the panel concluded that divestment was not only the morally correct option, but it was also financially viable. Eventually, the university’s investments linked to apartheid South Africa were pulled.

In August 1990, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded neighbouring Kuwait. A week later, the first US military forces arrived in Saudi Arabia. Upon the request of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, a US-led coalition launchedOperation Desert Stormin January 1991, bombing targets in both Iraq and Kuwait during a 43-day operation.

In late February 1991, students across several US university campuses – including the University of Michigan, Columbia University, George Washington University and Georgetown University – staged protests against US military involvement in the Gulf War. The police made 20 arrests at the University of California at Santa Cruz, the Washington Post, which described the protests as relatively “small and uneventful”, reported.

In March 2003, a US-led coalition launched began the bombardment of Iraq, which was followed by a ground invasion. The US claimed the move was part of its “war on terror”, using the allegation that Iraq’s leader possessed weapons of mass destruction. While Hussein was hanged in 2006, these weapons were never found. The Iraq war left the country rife with internal displacement, conflicts and economic instability.

American high school and university students walked out of their classes to protest against theIraq war.

On May 25, 2020,George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was killed by a white police officer,Derek Chauvin, in the state of Minnesota. Floyd’s death was caught on video which showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for around eight minutes.

The killing of Floyd sparked protests all over the US against systemic racism and police brutality under the “Black Lives Matter” movement which had begun in 2013 when George Zimmerman was acquitted of fatally shooting an unarmed young Black man, Trayvon Martin.

Several of these protests were staged by US university students. Student-led protests under the Black Lives Matter Movement also took place before 2018, such as in 2014 after the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/25/past-student-protests-in-the-us-working-hed,NEGATIVE,0.9001628756523132
Gaza Isreal War,Israel’s war in Gaza could spread beyond Middle East: Russia’s Putin,"Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has warned that Israel’s war in Gaza could spread well beyond the Middle East, saying it was wrong that innocent women, children and old people in the Palestinian enclave are being punished for other people’s crimes.

“Our task today, our main task, is to stop the bloodshed and violence,” Putin said at a Kremlin meeting with Russian religious leaders of different faiths on Wednesday, according to a Kremlin transcript.

The Russian president, who has been leading an all-out war in neighbouring Ukraine since February last year, said he told other world leaders in phone calls that if Israel’s military campaign in Gaza did not stop, there was a risk of a much wider conflagration.

“Further escalation of the crisis is fraught with grave and extremely dangerous and destructive consequences. And not only for the Middle East region. It could spill over far beyond the borders of the Middle East,” he added.

In remarks that criticised the West, he said certain unnamed forces were seeking to provoke further escalation and to draw as many other countries and peoples into the conflict as possible.

The aim, he said, was to “launch a real wave of chaos and mutual hatred not only in the Middle East but also far beyond its borders. For this purpose, among other things, they are trying to play on the national and religious feelings of millions of people.”

On Thursday, the Kremlin said efforts to agree on a “balanced” United Nations Security Council resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict should continue. This a day after Russia and Chinavetoeda United States-drafted resolution that called for a “humanitarian pause” to allow aid access, the protection of civilians and a stop to arming Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, and other armed groups in the enclave.

Diplomats have noted that a humanitarian pause is not the same as a ceasefire, which has been backed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. A pause might last only a matter of hours.

Russia made a rival UN proposal that advocated a wider ceasefire – an option it says is “much more balanced” – but the proposal failed to win the minimum number of votes.

“We need to call for a ceasefire and we cannot condemn the actions of only one side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. “The resolution should be balanced and diplomatic efforts should be continued here.”

Israel has resisted both a ceasefire and a humanitarian pause.

Overnight on Wednesday, the Israeli army launched a targetedground raidinto Gaza as part of “preparations for the next stages of combat”, which is widely expected to be a full-scale ground assault.

Israeli air raids on Gaza have already killed more than 6,500 people in nearly three weeks, since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which killed at least 1,400 people in Israel.

On Wednesday, Putin conveyed his condolences to the families of Israelis and citizens of other countries who were killed or wounded by Hamas.

He said Moscow continued to advocate for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli issue, something he said was the only way to reach a long-term settlement.

He made it clear though that he thought Israel was wrong to keep bombing Gaza in retaliation for the attack on Israeli citizens by Hamas.

“It is also clear to us that innocent people should not be held responsible for crimes committed by others,” said Putin.

“The fight against terrorism cannot be conducted according to the notorious principle of collective responsibility when old people, women, children, entire families and hundreds of thousands of people are left without shelter, food, water, electricity and medical care.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/26/israels-war-in-gaza-could-spread-beyond-middle-east-russias-putin,NEGATIVE,0.9364657998085022

Gaza Isreal War,Hamas says it will not enter negotiations unless Israel stops war on Gaza,"Hamas says it has told mediators it would not take part in more indirect negotiations during ongoing aggression but was ready for a “complete agreement” including an exchange of hostages and prisoners if Israel stopped its war on Gaza.

Talks led by key mediators Qatar, Egypt, and the United States to arrange a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group that governs Gaza have repeatedly stalled, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress.

The Hamas statement on Thursday came as Israel pressed on with an offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza, despite an order by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the top United Nations court, to halt its assault.

Hamas said it showed flexibility during negotiations and that it had entered every previous round of talks with a “positive” spirit, including the last round when it agreed to a mediator-proposed deal on May 6 – shortly after Israeli forces began the widely criticised ground offensive in Rafah.







“Hamas and the Palestinian factions will not accept to be part of this policy by continuing [ceasefire] negotiations in light of the aggression, siege, starvation and genocide of our people,” the Hamas statement read.

“Today, we informed the mediators of our clear position that if the occupation stops its war and aggression against our people in Gaza, our readiness [is] to reach a complete agreement that includes a comprehensive exchange deal,” it added.

There were significant sticking points in previous negotiations. Hamas repeatedly said it would not accept a deal that does not guarantee a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the unhindered return of displaced families to their homes.

Israel has rejected previous Hamas demands as unacceptable, and said it is determined to topple the group in Gaza. It claims its Rafah offensive is focused on rescuing hostages and rooting out Hamas fighters in the city.

More than 240 people were taken captive on October 7 when Hamas fighters launched an attack into southern Israel killing at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics.

Israel then launched its war on Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to health officials. The conflict has reduced much of the Palestinian territory to rubble and displaced the vast majority of residents.

A first round of negotiations between Israel and Hamas in November led to the release of about 100 captives in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. But since then talks have largely stalled.

On Thursday, Israel pressed on with its offensive on Rafah a day after saying its forces had taken control of a buffer zone along the nearby border between the Palestinian territory and Egypt, giving it effective authority over Gaza’s entire land frontier.

It claimed the buffer zone’s capture had cut off a route used by Hamas to smuggle arms into Gaza.

Gaza medical sources said 12 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike as they tried to recover the body of a civilian in the centre of Rafah.

Elsewhere in the coastal enclave, fighting raged in several areas, officials said. A Palestinian was killed in an air strike on Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City in the north of the densely populated enclave.

Israel reported fighting in southern, central and northern Gaza, but did not immediately comment on the reported deaths in Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians took refuge earlier in the war.







Communication services were cut off in Rafah “due to the ongoing aggression”, Palestinian telecommunications company Jawwal said in a statement.

The US, Israel’s closest ally, reiterated its opposition to a major ground offensive in Rafah on Tuesday but said it did not believe such an operation was under way.

Despite global outrage and numerous warnings from aid groups and the UN about the humanitarian consequences of the Rafah assault, Israel has vowed to continue.

As the assault intensifies, malnutrition has become widespread in Gaza as aid deliveries have slowed to a trickle, and the UN has warned of incipient famine.

Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said Palestinians have “little hope left”.

“Imagine being displaced seven or eight times since the war began and trying to save your children from air strikes each day and to find them food and water,” Khoudary said, speaking from the Al-Aqsa Hospital.

“We’ve seen three cases of malnourished children today. No medical supplies have entered the Gaza Strip for three weeks now.

Gaza Isreal War,"Israelis protest for captives, against Netanyahu’s Gaza war expansion","Thousands of Israelis have gathered outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv, urging the government to prioritise the release of captives still held inGazainstead of escalating military operations in the Palestinian territory.

The demonstration on Saturday was held as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government authorised the mobilisation of up to 60,000 reserve troops, signalling plans to intensify its assault on thebesieged Palestinian enclave.









One protester held aloft a placard castigating Netanyahu that read, “our tyrant is a liar, because of him the state is on fire”.

Government officials claim an expanded military offensive on Gaza will pressure Hamas into releasing the 59 remaining captives, but critics argue it further endangers their lives. Ending the fleeting ceasefire, which saw Palestinian prisoners exchanged for Israeli captives earlier this year, has not led to any more releases.

A video circulated by Hamas on Saturday purported to show one of the Israeli captives, whom local media identified as Maxim Herkin. In the four-minute video posted online, Herkin is seen being rescued by Hamas members after an Israeli attack struck a tunnel, burying and injuring the Israeli captive.

Families of the captives released a statement saying they spent the Sabbath gripped by “excruciating anxiety” after news of the government’s planned escalation and the effect it could have on those still held in Gaza.

The Bring Them Home Campaign, a group representing the relatives, condemned the move as reckless.

“Israel is on its way to sinking into the Gaza mud in the name of the illusion that it is possible to achieve any victory without returning our brothers and sisters from captivity,” the group said in a post on X. “Expanding the fighting will endanger the kidnapped, the living and the dead alike.”

They urged Netanyahu to abandon the offensive and instead reach an agreement that would secure the captives’ return. “Stop this mistake,” the group said.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Israeli journalist Gideon Levy said the protest movement remains consistent, but lacks the momentum to challenge Netanyahu’s coalition. “It’s the same old protest, very courageous and devoted, but not big enough to influence Netanyahu,” Levy said.

He noted that a large segment of Israeli society continues to support the war effort, even amid rising frustration from the captives’ families, and that “when [Israelis] are called to war, they will obey.”

Netanyahu, speaking Thursday at a public event in Jerusalem, seemed to suggest that defeating Hamas remains Israel’s top priority instead of the release of captives. “We want to bring all our hostages home,” he said. “The war has a supreme goal, and the supreme goal is victory over our enemies, and this we will achieve.”

Captives’ families have accused Netanyahu of undermining previous attempts to reach a truce and swap deal. Some believe his refusal to compromise reflects political motives, aimed at ensuring the survival of his far-right coalition government, rather than genuine concern for the captives.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/3/israelis-protest-for-captives-against-netanyahus-gaza-war-expansion,NEGATIVE,0.9822909832000732
Gaza Isreal War,Gaza’s 2024: A year of war and misery,"Palestinians in Gaza are entering the new year as defenceless and beleaguered as the last.

Israel’s war on the enclave continued into 2024, killing23,842people and wounding 51,925 during this year alone, driving the grisly official death toll to 46,376, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Israel has used siege and starve tactics, as well as scorched earth bombardment, drawing accusations that it is committing genocide, from rights groups and United Nations legal bodies.

All documented Israel’s systematic targeting of hospitals, displacement shelters, aid workers, journalists and so-called safe zones,which are often anything but.

In northern Gaza, the Israeli army has imposed a full and suffocating siege in an attempt to starve fighters and push out civilians,in what has been called “ethnic cleansing”.

These tactics violate international law and are creating the conditions to kill a people “in whole or in part”, matching the definition of genocide in the UN’s Genocide Convention, rights groups say.

“This last year has been very dark for us. How can I describe it in any other way? It’s been more than torturous,” said Eman Shaghnoubi, 52, from Deir el-Balah in Gaza.

“We have moved from one humiliation to another,” she added, remarking on the perpetual displacement of Palestinians in the enclave.

Israel has rendered34 hospitals in Gaza “nonfunctional”and forced 80 health centres to shut down entirely, according to the Gaza Government Media Office.

In the last few days, Israeli forces stormed the only remaining major hospital in Gaza’s devastated north, ejecting staff and patients before setting the medical facility on fire.

Torrential rain is currently lashing the tent villages that stand in place of many of Gaza’s towns and cities, withdeaths from hypothermiarising as freezing temperatures continue to flatline.

Shaghnoubi, who has six boys and two girls, said that her children are struggling to survive in the cold and that her small tent does not protect the family from the pouring rain.

“My children sleep on soaked bedding at night,” she told Al Jazeera.







Shereen Abu Nida, 40, also said that she and her four children are coping with hardship due to the terrible living conditions brought on by the war. Worse still, her husband was abducted by Israeli forces about a year ago, leaving her to care for her children alone.

“I have had to go through this whole year alone, all by myself,” she said, her voice quivering.

Musa Ali Muhammad al-Maghribi, 52, added that his family have little hope for the future.

He said his nine children are ill and he cannot find medication, nor is there enough food or clean water for his family, an ordeal that most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people face.

“[Israel] has destroyed us,” he told Al Jazeera. “Every day, we just hope to die.”

Despite the extreme hardship, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is showing no sign of halting the onslaught.

Efforts at mediating some form of ceasefire, which have been continuing throughout much of the conflict, have floundered in the face of what many, includingUnited States President Joe Biden in June, have slammed as political self-interest on the part of the Israeli prime minister.

Accusations of exploiting the war on Gaza for personal gain have centred upon Netanyahu’s attempts to deflect from his ongoing trial on charges ofbribery, fraud and breach of public trust, which he denies.

In addition, the prime minister’s corruption trial suggests that Netanyahu is seeking to prolong the war to distract from accusations of negligence or incompetence during the Hamas-led attack ofOctober 7 2023, which killed 1,139 Israelis.

Charges of opportunism have come from both within Netanyahu’s right-wing cabinet,as well as the street, where tens of thousands of people continue to rally in support of a deal that would see the captives taken during the Hamas-led attack released.

The international community has failed to halt – or mitigate –  the carnage in Gaza largely due to the US’s unqualified political and military support for Israel’s war on the enclave.

In addition to themore than $20bnin aid provided to Israel since the war began, the US has torpedoed diplomatic efforts within the UN to end the war, including suppressingrecent reports of the potential famineunder way in northern Gaza.

In January,the International Court of Justiceordered Israel to do all it could to prevent any act that could be considered genocide. Despite this, rights organisations based inPalestine and internationally, including Amnesty, have concluded that Israel has actively embarked upon a campaign of genocide within the Strip.







Similar international action has also been taken against both the Hamas and Israeli leadership. In November, theInternational Criminal Court (ICC)issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas leader Mohammed Deif.

Israelclaims to have killed Deifin July. Netanyahu and Gallant remain wanted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

In October, Israel defied international pressure and voted to ban the UN’s Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), widely acknowledged as one of Gaza’s principal lifelines. When the ban comes into effect in late January next year, Gaza will lose its principal aid agency and with it, much of the network that distributes food, medicine and the infrastructure needed to sustain life.

In December, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly for UNRWA’s work to continue and, for the third time, that aceasefire be immediately reached. Despite this, Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued and the agency’s future remains uncertain.

Palestinians in Gaza such as Abu Nida just hope the war will end soon this coming year.

“This has been the worst year of my life,” said Abu Nida.

Gaza Isreal War,Rift in Israel war cabinet as defence chief opposes ‘military rule’ in Gaza,"Divisions within Israel’s war cabinet over the lack of post-war plans for theGaza Striphave erupted in a rare public row, with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant saying the country should not be involved in ruling the besieged and bombarded territory once the fighting ends.

On Wednesday, Gallant said he was opposed to the Israeli military control or taking responsibility for the governance of Gaza.

“I must reiterate … I will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza. Israel must not establish civilian rule in Gaza,” he told a news conference.

Since the current conflict started in October, Gallant said he had been “raising this issue consistently in the cabinet, and have received no response,” rebuking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and calling on him to “make a decision”.

Netanyahu, who has indicated Israel intends to maintain open-ended control over security affairs in the enclave, responded to Gallant’s call saying he was not “prepared to exchange Hamastan for Fatahstan”. He has previously said that talking about the “day after” war was a moot point because the conflict would not end until the complete defeat of Hamas, the group that has been running Gaza since 2007.

Benny Gantz, another war cabinet member, came out in support of Gallant, saying he spoke the truth and that it was the leadership’s responsibility to do the right thing for the country at all costs.

“This is all really showing deepening divisions among members of the war cabinet at a very critical time,” said Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Amman, Jordan, following anIsraeli banon the network.

Far-right ministers took aim at Gallant, whose statement placed him in the crosshairs of National Security Minister ItamarBen-Gvirand Finance Minister BezalelSmotrich.

“The Minister of Defense who failed on October 7 and continues to fail today. Such a Minister of Defense must be replaced in order to achieve the goals of the war,” said Ben-Gvir in an X post.

Also posting on X, Smotrich said: “Defense Minister Gallant announced today his support for the establishment of a Palestinian terrorist state as a reward for terrorism and Hamas for the most terrible massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust.”







Despite promising to crush Hamas, Netanyahu has not expressed a clear vision of an alternative to the group following the war. Now, as the Israeli military ramps up its no-limits offensive on the territory, sending 600,000 fleeing from southern Rafah, the pressure is growing from critics at home and allies abroad – notably the United States – to present a plan for governance, security and rebuilding.

Disagreements over Gaza’s future have led to increasingly public friction between Israel and the US. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken chided Israel for the lack of a plan in some of his strongest public criticism. Jamjoom said the latest developments presaged “a bigger fracture in the relationship between the US and Israel”.

Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said the Netanyahu administration had “lost control”.

“Relations with the US are collapsing, the middle class is collapsing,” he said. “Soldiers are being killed every day in Gaza and they fight among themselves on television. The cabinet is disassembled and non-functional. Ministers protest in front of cabinet meetings.”

As of Monday, 272 Israeli soldiers have been killed and 1,674 injured in Gaza and along the border with the Palestinian territory since the start of the war. On Thursday, the Israeli military said five soldiers were killed in northern Gaza, attributing it to “friendly fire”.

It said in a statement that seven troops were wounded in the incident on Wednesday. According to a preliminary investigation, two Israeli tanks in the area opened fire on a house used by the Israeli battalion’s deputy commander, the military said.

The head of Hamas’s political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, said on Wednesday in response to the debate over Gaza’s post-war future that “the Hamas movement is here to stay”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/16/rift-in-israel-war-cabinet-as-defence-chief-opposes-military-rule-in-gaza,NEGATIVE,0.9932472705841064

Gaza Isreal War,"What has the ICJ ordered Israel to do on Gaza war, and what’s next?","The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued Israel with six orders in relation to its bombardment of Gaza on Friday, but stopped short of calling for a full ceasefire.

The emergency measures were announced as the court begins its deliberations on South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, for which it heard evidence earlier this month. South Africa has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide but Israel has rejected the allegation, claiming that its activities in Gaza stem from “self-defence”, and are necessary to root out Hamas. It has added that the war cannot end until that goal has been achieved.

In a 45-minute judgement at the court in the Hague on Friday, presiding judge Joan Donoghue rejected Israel’s claim that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear South Africa’s case against it.

Israel said that South Africa failed to adequately communicate with Tel Aviv about the case before filing the application, as is required by the court’s own rules. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that South Africa had made a complaint to the Israeli embassy in Pretoria, to which Israel had clearly responded. Therefore a “dispute” over the interpretation of the law relating to genocide exists. South Africa has clear standing to submit its case, the court ruled.

South Africa had also requested nine emergency measures be taken against Israel by the court. The ICJ directed Israel to implement six.

Israel’s war on Gaza has already killed more than 26,000 Palestinians in the besieged enclave. Israel’s blockade on the strip has also severely restricted access to food, water, fuel and medical support.

Here is what you need to knowabout the ruling, its impact, and what might happen next.

The ICJ confirmed that it does have jurisdiction to hear the case submitted by South Africa and issued six emergency orders to Israel, as follows:

Measure approved by a vote of 15-2. Dissenting judges: Judge Julia Sebutinde of Uganda and the Israeli representative, Judge Aharon Barak.

Measure approved by a vote of 15-2. Dissenting judges: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda and the Israeli representative, Judge Barak.

Measure approved by a vote of 16-1. Dissenting judge: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda.

Measure approved by a vote of 16-1. Dissenting judge: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda.

Measure approved by a vote of 15-2. Dissenting judges: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda and the Israeli representative, Judge Barak.

Measure approved by a vote of 15-2. Dissenting judges: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda and the Israeli representative, Judge Barak.

South Africa’s 84-page lawsuit, filed on December 29, 2023, accused Israel of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention in the war on Gaza that began on October 7, 2023.

South Africa asked the court to order Israel to:

As members of the United Nations, both South Africa and Israel are bound by the court’s rulings and cannot appeal a decision. However, the ICJ itself does not have any mechanism to enforce its orders.

South Africa or other nations could also go to the UN Security Council (UNSC), where member states would be asked to vote to require Israel to abide by the emergency measures ordered by the ICJ.

On previous occasions since the war on Gaza began, the US has used its power of veto to block resolutions calling for a ceasefire and for accountability of its close ally, Israel. However, experts say that Washington’s veto of an ICJ-approved decisioncould damageand undermine US President Joe Biden’s calls for others – including rivals like China and Russia – to uphold the international rules-based order.

“This could make a real difference for the US administration and certainly a pose real dilemma for it,” James Bays, Al Jazeera English’s diplomatic editor said, reporting from The Hague.

If the UNSC passes a resolution requiring Israel to abide by the orders of the ICJ, it would have the power to takepunitive actionagainst Israel. Past examples of this have included economic or trade sanctions, arms embargoes and travel bans.

The UN charter also allows the Council to go a step further and intervene with force. Anexample of thiswas the 1991 US-led military alliance that was created to counter the invasion of Kuwait by the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. Experts believe it is highly unlikely that the US will allow the Security Council to take any such step against Israel.

Neve Gordon, professor of international law at Queen Mary University of London, added that countries, such as the US, would now have to seriously rethink using a veto or even normalisation of diplomatic ties with Israel.

“It’s a new ballgame now, where the highest court in the world is saying, prima facie [on first impression], Israel is committing genocide”, he said.

Friday’s ruling was just an interim ruling to address the emergency measures requested by South Africa.

Israel is required to submit its report on the actions it is taking to fulfil the above emergency orders by February 26 – one month from Friday’s ruling. South Africa will then be given the chance to respond to this report.

The court will then assess the report and additional information on Gaza’s on-ground realities. It could conclude that Israel is not abiding by the first provisions and impose new ones.

The court will then also move forward with additional hearings and deliberations on the evidence presented to the court earlier this month by South Africa supporting its accusations against Israel, and of Israel’s defence.

The judges will individually evaluate South Africa’s key claims in relation to genocide in Gaza, and the court’s eventual ruling will be determined by a majority.

The court said its decision to move forward with the case was based on its conclusion that South Africa’s evidence alleging genocide by Israel could not be ruled out “prima facie”.

Gordon said that this is “major”.

Experts have itcould bethree or four years before a judgement is passed.

Also called the World Court, the ICJ is a UN civil court that adjudicates disputes between countries. It is distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes individuals for war crimes.

The ICJ comprises 15 judges who are appointed for terms of nine years through elections at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the Security Council (UNSC). For this case, they are joined by two special representative judges – Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke from South Africa and Supreme Court President Aharon Barak from Israel.

Judges are supposed to be impartial but in the past,some have votedin line with their countries’ politics. For instance, when Ukraine approached the ICJ seeking provisional measures against Russia, including an order that the Kremlin halt its war, 13 out of 15 judges voted in favour of Kyiv’s request. The only two who did not were the judges from Russia and China.

On Friday, the only two judges who dissented from all or some of the measures imposed by the court were Judge Julia Sebutinde of Uganda, who voted against all of the orders, and Judge Aharon Barak, who voted against four of the six orders.

Judge Sebutinde released her dissenting opinion, in which she argued that she did not agree that Israel had shown “intent” to commit genocide and, therefore, the case did not fall within the remit of the ICJ.

Although the ICJ stipulated that Israel must abide by the 1948 Genocide Convention, it stopped short of calling for a ceasefire or suspension of hostilities.

“I see no way that Israel can abide by the other provisional measures without stopping its hostilities,” said Gordon, noting that steps like increased humanitarian aid would require a ceasefire.

Previous reports have shown that broken roads and continued Israeli bombardment have obstructed aid from being effectively disbursed in the enclave.

Additionally, the provisional measure calling to punish those who incite genocide in Gaza would likely not apply to members of Israel’s Knesset, as they have parliamentary immunity.

The Knesset would have to vote to revoke a member’s immunity before punishing them, which Gordon says is unlikely considering the majority of them support Israel’s war on Gaza.

Nonetheless, Israel would have to try and punish non-parliamentarians, including troops and commentators, for statements that call for the mass killing of Palestinians.

Furthermore, the court made special reference to comments made by three senior Israeli officials which it deemed to show genocidal intent. Gordon said that the court’s reference to these statements made by officials, including Israeli President Izaac Herzog, was “extremely important”. It showed that the court “clearly” disagrees with Israeli interpretations that such comments are sporadic and have no causal relation with the country’s military operations, he said.

Neil Sammonds, senior campaigner on Palestine at the human rights group, War on Want, said it would be difficult to enforce the measures ordered by the court, however. “This leaves everything in Israel’s hands. There are no specifics about how Israel should bring in more aid and Netanyahu has already said Israel will not abide by the court’s ruling.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/what-has-the-icj-ordered-israel-to-do-on-gaza-war-and-whats-next,NEGATIVE,0.978851318359375

Gaza Isreal War,What’s the Israel-Palestine conflict about? A simple guide,"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced many millions of people and has its roots in a colonial act carried out more than a century ago.

With Israel declaring war on the Gaza Strip after an unprecedented attack by the armed Palestinian group Hamas on Saturday, the world’s eyes are again sharply focused on what might come next.

Hamas fighters have killed more than 800 Israelis in assaults on multiple towns in southern Israel. In response, Israel has launched a bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 500 Palestinians. It has mobilised troops along the Gaza border, apparently in preparation for a ground attack. And on Monday, it announced a “total blockade” of the Gaza Strip, stopping the supply of food, fuel and other essential commodities to the already besieged enclave in an act that under international law amounts to a war crime.

But what unfolds in the coming days and weeks has its seed in history.

For decades, Western media outlets, academics, military experts and world leaders have described the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as intractable, complicated and deadlocked.

Here’s a simple guide to break down one of the world’s longest-running conflicts:

Gaza Isreal War,Israeli attacks kill more than 60 as Gaza blockade accelerates starvation,"Israel’s attacks on Gaza have killed at least 61 people since dawn, targeting civilians in crowded places as its more than two-month blockade of the besieged and bombarded enclave has causedacute food shortages, accelerating the starvation of the Palestinian population.

A reconnaissance drone strike targeted an area near the Thai and Palmyra restaurants on al-Wehda Street in Gaza City on Wednesday. Two missiles were fired at two locations at the same time, 100 metres (110 yards) apart, one inside a restaurant and another at an intersection, killing at least 17 people.

Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the attack hit one of the few places where Palestinians are able to get a meal.

“The tables and chairs are all thrown around, and blood stains the ground as a result of severe bleeding,” Mahmoud said, reporting from a crowd of residents and street vendors examining the destruction after the attack.

At the site of the attack on the nearby intersection, Mahmoud said people were on the ground “soaked in blood and shredded into pieces”.

Another attack in Gaza City killed 13 people at al-Karama School in the Tuffah neighbourhood

Other Israeli strikes on Wednesday were scattered across Gaza. Three people were killed and several wounded in a strike on a house in Jabalia in northern Gaza.

Another eight people – including a father, his children and cousins – were killed in the southern city of Khan Younis. Five were killed in a strike on one home.

Another three people, including a child, died when a tent shelter was attacked in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. A husband and wife were also killed when a house was hit in Bani Suheila village in eastern Gaza.

The dead also included four people whose bodies were recovered from under the rubble of an Israeli attack earlier this week on a school sheltering displaced people in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. The Palestinian Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday night that more than 30 people had been killed and dozens wounded there.

Mahmoud said Palestinians were “scrambling for cover” as air strikes and explosions struck residential buildings and evacuation centres across Gaza.

“We have confirmed that a farmer was killed in the eastern part of Khan Younis, in Abasan, as he was trying to harvest what he managed to plant in the past couple of months, making up for the lack of food,” Mahmoud said.

“This is one of the elements that we have been seeing quite visibly. Not only are they suffering on a daily basis because of the enforced starvation and dehydration, they [also] try to plant their own food, but they are deprived, and their abilities to do so are [thwarted] by the ongoing attacks,” he added.

The intensified attacks have been compounded by an Israeli blockade on essential supplies since March 2, leaving the enclave deprived of fuel and food, including flour. Aid groups have said food supplies are close to total depletion.

The United States-based World Central Kitchen charity said it has halted work in the Gaza Strip after it was prevented by Israel from bringing in aid and ran out of supplies.

“After serving more than 130 million total meals and 26 million loaves of bread over the past 18 months, World Central Kitchen no longer has the supplies to cook meals or bake bread in Gaza,” it said on Wednesday in a post on X.

A mother of six sheltering at a facility run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) told the agency her family only had bread after they had run out of all other types of food.

“The State of Israel must lift the siege,” UNRWA wrote on X on Wednesday.

“There must be a concerted international effort to stop this humanitarian catastrophe from reaching a new unseen level,” it added.

Gaza’s health sector is also bearing the brunt of the ongoing attacks and blockade. At least 88 percent of beds in hospitals are occupied, and their staffs are trying to treat patients as they face shortages of medical supplies.







On Wednesday, Egypt and Qatar, which both mediated this year’s ceasefire alongside the US, reaffirmed their commitment to an agreement aimed at ending the “​​unprecedented humanitarian crisis and alleviating the suffering of civilians by fostering the necessary conditions for achieving a comprehensive ceasefire”.

“The two countries emphasise that attempts to sow discord among brotherly nations – whether through the casting of doubt, distortion, or media escalation – will not succeed, nor will they deter the two nations from continuing their joint efforts to end the war and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe,” a joint statement read, adding that the countries were working with the US to reach a deal.

While Israel announced that a more intensemilitary offensivewould begin in Gaza unless a ceasefire was signed, Hamas said the talks werepointless.

Gaza Isreal War,"Israel resumes its war on us, the people of Gaza","Deir el-Balah, Gaza– It wasn’t a nightmare, it was real. The war had returned, just like that, without warning.

The clock read 2:10am when we woke up in terror to the deafening sound of air strikes. A violent noise shook everything around us.









My daughter, Banias, woke up screaming in fear: “Baba! Mama! What’s happening?”

She was right next to me, crying out in terror, but I couldn’t even reassure her. My mind was in complete chaos.

Is this bombing again? What’s happening? Who’s attacking us?

In a moment of denial, I thought: are these Yemeni missiles on Israel? Is this strike hitting us?

Oh my God. The explosions intensified, and the sound was unmistakable, one we knew too well – Israeli air strikes on Gaza.

My husband held Banias, trying to calm her down.







I ran to my phone, scrolling through local journalist groups. Everyone was asking: “What’s happening?”

Minutes passed before the news started rolling in: a house targeted in Deir el-Balah, a strike on a home in Nuseirat.

Several tents for displaced families were bombed in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, and there was artillery shelling in Rafah.

An entire residential building was hit in Jabalia, northern Gaza, and there were strikes in the al-Karama neighbourhood. A “belt of fire” unleashed on central Gaza.

Then came the desperate pleas: “A family’s trapped under the rubble.”

“A residential block has been levelled.”

“We need ambulances.”

People screamed for help, calling for civil defence teams.

And still, the bombing continued – violent, relentless.

Photos and videos flooded in – shattered bodies, martyrs, the wounded filling every functioning medical centre in the Strip. Scenes that we had barely begun to forget, returned.

Moments later, Israel officially announced it was abrogating the ceasefire and resuming its war on Gaza.

It felt like a blow to the head.

“What does this mean?” my sister, who had come to spend a few days with me, cried out. “No, God, no! We don’t want war again. We don’t want the bombing, the fear.”

We all stared at the news, eyes wide with shock. “Oh God, enough … enough.”

Still clutching my phone, I scrolled further – images of infants killed in the air strikes, burning tents, entire residential blocks reduced to rubble.

Oh God, the same images, the same suffering, the same nightmare.

War was picking up exactly where it had left off – without embellishment, without pretence, without disguise. Just killing, bombing, extermination and an endless flood of blood.

My family around me asked, “What about the north? Will they close the road between north and south again?”

We were trapped.

Just last night, I invited my father and my twin sisters, both in their 20s, for a Ramadan iftar at our place in al-Zawayda, near Deir el-Balah in central Gaza. It was a simple family gathering, and I convinced them to stay the night, planning for us all to head north the next morning.







We had planned a few Ramadan visits, and some errands to buy clothes for the children before Eid and summer arrived. As always, every visit to the north was also an opportunity to explore new stories.

Now, all those “plans” were meaningless. In a single moment, life had flipped upside down. The war was back.

Planning has become a crime in this place. To plan for your day, no matter how mundane, even something as simple as shopping or spending time with family is an unforgivable luxury.

Here, you are guilty for expecting normalcy, you’re condemned to live in a constant state of alert – every second, every minute, every hour, every day, every year.

My sister, who works in media for a humanitarian organisation, suddenly realised: “Oh God! I didn’t bring my laptop or my things! What do I do now?”

Guilt consumed me. I was the one who convinced them to stay, this was my fault.

What if they close the roads? What will the next phase of the war look like? Will the war start in the north? Or will they invade the central area?

There is only Deir el-Balah left now. Oh God, what kind of trap is this?

My mind spiralled, flipping through thoughts – would we have to wear our protective press vests again? Go back to working from hospitals?

But we had already dismantled our tent workspace there. Journalists had withdrawn, scattered between north and south, trying to start over.

Wait, what about Banias’s school? I had just registered her in a school last week, surely that was over now. We were back to war.

My heart ached. When the ceasefire began, we felt some relief, but never safety. Fear, hesitation and confusion clung to us.

We didn’t know where to start, we didn’t dare to plan and every time we did, the missiles reminded us of our mistake.

Two days ago, my husband and I went shopping and for the first time, I dared to buy a single rug, a table and chairs, plates and spoons, and a few kitchen essentials.

Since moving here, all we had were four mattresses, four blankets, four plates, four spoons and a small pot for cooking.

Throughout the war, we refused to get anything else. Our clothes were stacked on a sheet spread on the floor in a designated room, divided into sections for each of us, we jokingly called it “the dressing room”.







It was always a mess, organising the clothes on the floor was a daily battle and every time we stepped into the room, my husband and I would say: “We need a closet.”

A closet was a grand luxury, it took a ceasefire for us to even think about buying one, although we were hesitating over whether to stay in the south or move north. We always chose to travel light, ready to flee at any moment.

But just yesterday morning, I finally packed away our winter clothes and told my husband: “Let’s buy a closet.”

Now I had my answer. This renewed bombing meant that the closet was no longer an option, chaos awaited instead … the chaos of my thoughts, my shattered plans, the chaos of a life I could no longer control, no matter how hard I tried.

And despite all the destruction and ruin around us, as if it wasn’t already enough, we know we can no longer dream, no longer plan, no longer wish for anything, no longer look forward to anything.

All we want is do to survive.

Gaza Isreal War,Israel says war on Gaza likely to last another seven months,"Israel’s national security adviser says the continuing war on Gaza is likely to last through the end of the year.

In an interview with Israel’s Kan public broadcaster on Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said “we are expecting another seven months of fighting” to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group.

His remarks came as Israel finds itself increasingly isolated on the world stage nearly eight months into the assault, with even the United States and other close allies expressing outrage over the civilian death toll.

Hanegbi defended Israel’s ongoing operations in Rafah, on Gaza’s border with Egypt, saying the frontier had become a “smuggling kingdom” since 2007, when Hamas began governing Gaza.

“Every rocket, every explosive device, every shot fired at Israel is because that border was breached,” he said.

Later on Wednesday, an Israeli military spokesman said the army had gained “operational control” over the narrowPhiladeplhi Corridor, a buffer zone between Egypt and Gaza that was created as part of the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.

“In recent days, our forces have taken operational control of the Philadelphi Corridor,” army spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised address.







Egypt has expressed grave concerns about Israel’s Rafah offensive, saying it threatens the peace treaty.

Hanegbi’s remarks raise questions about the future of Gaza and what kind of role Israel will play in it. Already, top ally the US has demanded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu produce a postwar vision for the Palestinian territory, and his defence minister and a top governing partner have warned that he must take steps to ensure that Israel does not remain in Gaza indefinitely.

Israel’s assault has already devastated Gaza’s urban landscape, displaced most of the territory’s population and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe and widespread hunger. Israel claims it must dismantle Hamas’s last remaining battalions in Rafah and also said it will seek indefinite security control over the Gaza Strip.

Hamas has rejected any postwar plan that excludes the group, reiterating that it will remain in Gaza.

The Rafah offensive has so far killed dozens of Palestinians as NGOs and professional unions declared Gaza a “famine-stricken” zone.

Recent attackshave struck so-called safe humanitarian zones near Rafah, killing dozens of people, according to Palestinian officials.

Israeli tanks moved into the heart of Rafah city on Tuesday despite an order from the International Court of Justice for Israel to end its attacks on the area.

Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said that in the central part of Rafah city, there is “a confirmed report of families trapped inside their residential homes, caught in the line of artillery fire”.

Israeli quadcopters had pursued people there, he said, preventing them from evacuating to safer areas.

“From the northeast to the northwest of Rafah, where tent camps have been attacked in recent days, the situation is getting worse by the hour because of the expansive military operations,” Mahmoud said.

“At the same time, nearly all health and public facilities are pushed out of service right now.”

The World Court said Israel had not explained how it would keep evacuees from Rafah safe and provide food, water and medicine. Its ruling also called on Hamas to release hostages taken from Israel on October 7 immediately and unconditionally.

Rafah residents said Israeli tanks had pushed into Tal as-Sultan in the west and Yibna and near Shaboura in the centre before retreating towards a buffer zone on the border with Egypt, rather than staying put as they have in other offensives.







Palestinian health officials said on Wednesday that 19 civilians had been killed in Israeli air strikes and shelling across Gaza.

Health Minister Majed Abu Ramadan urged Washington to pressure Israel to open the Rafah crossing to Egypt for aid supplies, saying that there was no indication that Israeli authorities would do so soon and that patients in besieged Gaza were dying for lack of treatment.

The United States, Israel’s closest ally, reiterated its opposition to a major ground offensive in Rafah on Tuesday while saying it did not believe such an operation was under way.

The armed wing of Hamas and that of its ally PIJ said they confronted invading forces in Rafah with antitank rockets and mortar bombs and blew up explosive devices they had planted, resulting in numerous successful hits.

The Israeli military said three Israeli soldiers were killed and three badly wounded.

In the nearby city of Khan Younis, an Israeli air strike killed three people overnight, including Salama Baraka, a former senior Hamas police officer, medics and Hamas media said. Another killed four people, including two children, medics said.

In northern Gaza, Israeli forces shelled Gaza City neighbourhoods and moved deeper into Jabalia, where residents said large residential districts were destroyed.

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s Gaza offensive, according to health officials.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/29/israel-says-war-on-gaza-likely-to-last-another-seven-months,NEGATIVE,0.9942983984947205

Gaza Isreal War,"Rafah, US arms, UNRWA: How Biden defends supporting Israel amid Gaza war","Washington, DC –“It’s wrong,” United States PresidentJoe Bidensaid last week of the ongoing Israeli offensive against the southern Gaza city of Rafah, pledging to stop supplying offensive weapons if the assault proceeds.

One week later, however, Israeli forces have seized the Rafah border crossing and pushed into the city, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering. Still, US media reported on Tuesday that Biden plans to advance a $1bn arms transfer to Israel, including tank shells.

Advocates say the apparent contradiction — between pressuring Israel to stop its offensive, then offering further weaponry — is part of a broader pattern whereby the US says one thing but does another.

“We’ve got a situation where the rhetoric is not matching the action,” said Hassan El-Tayyab, legislative director for Middle East policy at the advocacy group Friends Committee on National Legislation. “It’s obviously distressing seeing the US complicity in these horrific war crimes.”

Biden’s statements one week prior signalled to some advocates that Washington may finally use its leverage to pressure Israel to end its abuses against Palestinians.

In a CNN interview, the president said he would stop the transfer of artillery shells to Israel in the case of a Rafah invasion, and his administration ultimately withheld one shipment of heavy bombs over the assault.

But advocates say the media reports of the $1bn transfer raises questions about Biden’s commitment to protecting civilians in Rafah — and standing up to Israel, its longtime ally.







Here, Al Jazeera looks at how the Biden administration presents its policies to overcome legal and political questions about its unconditional support for Israel.

Claim:The US government says Israel has not launched a major invasion of Rafah.

“We believe that what we’re seeing right now is a targeted operation. That’s what Israel has told us. We have not seen a major operation moving forward,” White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday.

Fact:The Israeli offensive in Rafah has so far displaced450,000 Palestiniansfrom the city and further strained the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, raising fears of catastrophic consequences.

While Israeli troops have not entered the dense urban centre of Rafah, Israel’s tanks have been pushing deeperinto the city. Last week, the State Department acknowledged that theoretically “a series of limited operations” can constitute “one large one”.

“It’s not credible to say that the Rafah offensive has not started. From everything we’re seeing, the Rafah invasion is happening. And it should have already crossed that red line,” El-Tayyab told Al Jazeera.







Claim:The Biden administration says it is pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza, often blaming Hamas for rejecting proposals to reach a deal to halt the fighting.

“Israel put a forward-leaning proposal on the table for a ceasefire and hostage deal,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday. “The world should be calling on Hamas to come back to the table and accept a deal.”

Fact:TheUS has vetoedthree separate ceasefire draft resolutions at the United Nations Security Council and voted against two at the General Assembly.

Hamashas accepteda deal put forward by Qatar and Egypt that would lead to a lasting ceasefire and the release of Israeli captives in Gaza and a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel. The Israeli government rejected it.

“What we need is a permanent ceasefire now to end this mass killing, and we need to move towards a resolution of the deeper issues of this horrible conflict,” El-Tayyab said.







Claim:The US says it cannot definitively determine whether Israel is using American weapons to violate international law.

The Biden administration issued a report last week saying that Israel offered “credible and reliable” assurances that US arms are not being deployed to commit abuses.

Fact:Rights groups have documented numerous violations of international humanitarian law by the Israeli military, which extensively uses US weapons. Those reports include evidence ofindiscriminate bombing, torture and targeting civilians.

“There’s a version of reality that this administration would like people to believe in. And then there is a version of reality that people have been actually watching for months now in Gaza, with horrific images of the killing of civilians, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, the starvation of an entire population,” Palestinian American analyst Yousef Munayyer told Al Jazeera.

“And these two realities don’t line up at all. And so, I don’t know what audience this theatre is intended for. But I can’t imagine it being persuasive to anybody really.”







Claim:The Biden administration says it applies the “same standards” to Israel in enforcing theLeahy Law, which prohibits assistance to foreign military units that commit abuses.

Last month, the US State Department said it would not suspend aid to any Israeli battalions despite acknowledging that five units had engaged in gross violations of human rights.

Washington said four of the battalions had taken remedial steps to address the abuses, and the US is engaging with Israel over the fifth unit.

Fact:Experts say the US has a special process in applying the Leahy Law to Israel, giving the country more time and leeway to address allegations of abuse.

“They have made the determination that the unit has been engaged in gross violations and that the host country has failed to remediate,” Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), told Al Jazeera last week.

“And they still have not cut off that unit. That is an admission that the secretary of state is violating US law.”







Claim:The Biden administration says it cut off funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) to “comply with the law”.

The law in question is a governmentfunding billthat Congress passed in March, banning aid to UNRWA.

The UN agency provides vital services to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East and has played a leading role in aid delivery in Gaza.

Fact:Biden supported the funding legislation and signed it into law. Washington had also suspended its assistance to the agency weeks before the bill was approved, following Israeli allegations of links between UNRWA and Hamas.

Last month, anindependent reviewof UNRWA, commissioned by the UN, found that Israel did not provide credible evidence to back its accusations.

“Our political process has chosen to cut US funding to literally the only entity that can address the level of suffering and scale of suffering that’s happening in Gaza right now,” Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute (AAI), told Al Jazeera earlier this year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/15/rafah-us-arms-unrwa-how-biden-defends-supporting-israel-amid-gaza-war,NEGATIVE,0.9946324825286865
Gaza Isreal War,Timeline: Israel’s attacks on Gaza since 2005,"Israeli air raids have continued to hit Gaza and the violence has gone into athird day on Sunday.

At least 30 Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed and over 200 injured.

It marks the latest assault by Israel on Gaza since the 11-day war in May 2021 killed hundreds and wounded thousands.

The following timeline lists major attacks carried out by Israeli forces on Gaza since 2005 when it withdrew from the Gaza Strip, a coastal enclave home to 2.3 million people:

August 2005– Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza 38 years after capturing it from Egypt, abandoning settlements and leaving it under the control of the Palestinian Authority.

January 2006– Hamas, an armed group, wins the majority of seats in a Palestinian legislative election.



June 2006– Hamas captures Israeli army conscript Gilad Shalit in a cross-border raid from Gaza, prompting Israeli air raids and incursions.

December 2008– Israel launches a 22-day military offensive in Gaza after rockets were fired at the southern Israeli town of Sderot. About 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed before a ceasefire is agreed upon.

November 2012– Israel kills Hamas’s military chief of staff, Ahmad Jabari, followed by eight days of Israeli air raids on Palestine.

July-August 2014– The kidnap and killing of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas leads to a seven-week war in which more than 2,100 Palestinians are killed in Gaza along with 73 Israelis, including 67 soldiers.



March 2018– Palestinian protests begin at Gaza’s fenced border with Israel and Israeli troops open fire to keep them back. More than 170 Palestinians killed in several months of protests, prompting fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces.

May 2021– After weeks of tension during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, hundreds of Palestinians are injured by Israeli security forces at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. Hamas demanded Israel withdraw security forces from the compound. Israel launched air raids on Gaza in response to what it said were rockets fired from Gaza. In the fighting that went on for 11 days, at least 260 people were killed in Gaza and 13 died in Israel.

August 2022– More than 30 Palestinians, including women and children, killed in new air attacks carried out by Israeli planes. Palestinian Islamic Jihad, whose two commanders were killed in the air strikes, fires dozens of rockets into Israel in response.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/7/timeline-israels-attacks-on-gaza-since-2005,NEGATIVE,0.980303168296814
Gaza Isreal War,Israel’s war on Gaza and the West’s credibility crisis,"Over the past decade and a half, I have attended many meetings and conferences, and met many people in Western governments, think tanks and academia who have been concerned about the rise of autocracies across the world. Many of them believe that authoritarian tendencies are the biggest threat to the liberal world order and rules-based system.

But I beg to differ. I believe the biggest threat to the liberal world order comes from liberal democracies and not their autocratic nemeses. That is because there is a widening chasm between the values Western governments proclaim to uphold and their actual conduct. That has triggered a credibility crisis that threatens to unravel the liberal world order.









What we say about our value system and how we project our foreign policy objectives in our statements is important, but even more important is what we do afterwards. People have eyes and ears, and when what they see is the opposite of what they hear, they lose trust.

This is what is happening now with Western rhetoric and actions in relation to Israel and Palestine. This mismatch between what is said and what is being done is, of course, nothing new.

I come from a region where we have suffered immensely as a result of the great liberal promise of the West; our neighbour Afghanistan faced disaster not once, but twice because of it. As we moved from one war to another after the 9/11 attacks in the US, the Western-made liberal order started to lose its credibility faster than the West had time to realise. It left behind a debris of chaos, bloodshed and broken promises of “democratisation” and “emancipation”. The “others” started questioning the Western narrative and its legitimacy.

Wars leave behind devastation that persists long after the fighting and funding for “reconstruction” end and long after the media spotlight, the fervent hashtags and impassioned posts move on, as the world’s collective conscience loses interest. The aftershocks are felt in the geography where the wars are conducted for generations, as people continue to experience a conflict’s intended and unintended consequences.

I was in office when the Russian war on Ukraine started and I experienced firsthand how the US, the EU, the UK and other Western countries tried to convince many in the developing world that they must not stand on the side of aggression, that they must not be “on the wrong side of history”.

As the UN Security Council could not pass any resolution because of Russia’s veto, the West expended a great deal of political capital to bring resolution after resolution in the General Assembly in support of Ukraine. It aimed to show the world that Russia was using its veto power against the global consensus and was in fact isolated on the world stage.

And then came the war in Gaza. I watched with incredulity when pleas echoed from Gaza in the form of resolutions brought forward to the UN Security Council urging an end to the bloodshed and asking for a humanitarian ceasefire only to be vetoed by the US.

As the UN pleaded for action – calling Gaza a “graveyard for children” and reporting that more UN aid workers had died in the last few months in Gaza than in any other conflict – the West, which had historically been a champion of multilateralism, did nothing. In fact, it came in the way of those who were trying to stop the indiscriminate killing of civilians.

This forced UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres toinvokein early December Article 99 – used only at times when international peace and security are threatened. Even then, the West took no action; the USvetoeda subsequent resolution for a humanitarian ceasefire at the UNSC and thenvotedagainst a nonbinding resolution at the General Assembly supported by 153 countries. The UK abstained in both votes. Let that sink in.

What makes this more unpalatable than Russia’s veto at the Security Council is that unlike Russia, the US and UK sanction people and countries on human rights violations and call for interventions on human rights grounds. How can the rest of the world have trust in the West’s self-declared “value-based leadership” when countries like the US and UK abdicate their responsibility and side with the aggressor?

This obvious hypocrisy is reminiscent of the tale of the emperor’s new clothes: Everyone can see Western rhetoric is naked.

The West talks about commitment to human rights and democratic values, while at the same time offering full diplomatic cover to the state of Israel and ensuring its impunity in massacring as many Palestinians as it desires in the pursuit of its official, declared goal of complete extermination of the Palestinian people.

In supporting Israel and enabling it to kill tens of thousands of civilians, the majority of them women and children in the name of “self-defence”, Western countries are putting themselves at the opposite end of the values and principles of multilateralism and respect for human rights they have put mammoth effort in promoting in the past. They are going against the very fundamentals on which the United Nations was built.

I believe in the commonality of our values, I believe that the West has much to celebrate in its human rights and development records, but I also know that the West has shown glaring disregard for these principles outside of its own geography.

Anyone concerned with the US’s global leadership or retention of its status as the leader of “the free world” should certainly be asking themselves why it has decided to isolate itself on the world stage and why it is willing to pay such a high diplomatic price that will have reputational and credibility repercussions for decades.

Washington’s stance today would not only undermine efforts to promote it as the only reliable world power, but would also sabotage its ability to play the role of a peace builder in the future.

If the US wants to save its global reputation, it should first and foremost stop standing in the way of Security Council resolutions demanding a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. It should also stop opposing General Assembly resolutions that commit to a two-state solution and condemn Israeli settlements; both of these elements are already part of US-stated policy. Finally, it needs to respond to the appeals of UN institutions and stop obstructing its actions.

Those who claim the UN has failed in the wake of this crisis are grotesquely wrong. The UN continues to unambiguously report what is happening on the ground and call for global action. Whether it is the UNGA, the voice of the collective conscience of the world, or the secretary-general, or the WHO chief or the UNICEF chief – they have all made incredible efforts to get the world to act and stop the violence.

I have served in government long enough to know that as officials, we often make the mistake of thinking our job is to maintain positions on certain issues that our countries have historically held. But this is the wrong way to go about building policy. Our job should be to hold principles not positions. Leadership requires strength to stand on the side of what is right not on the side of historical positions.

More than 180 Palestinians have beenkilledand about 600 injured in the first day of Israel’srenewed attackson Gaza, according to the health ministry in Gaza.

The armed wings of Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they fired barrages of rockets and mortars towards various Israeli cities and settlements from Gaza.

Gaza is the “most dangerous place in the world to be a child” Catherine Russell, the head of UNICEF said in a presentation to the United Nations Security Council.

The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists said 61 reporters have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza – 54 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese.

Fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border resumed after the collapse of a week-long truce, with at least three people also killed in southern Lebanon by Israeli fire.







Qatar, which has played a central mediating role in truce efforts, said talks are still continuing with Israelis and Palestinians to restore the truce, but the renewed bombardment of Gaza has complicated matters.

United States defence secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington is working diplomatically to restore the truce with Israel, Egypt and Qatar, while blaming Hamas for failing to meet conditions on hostages and for an attack in Jerusalem.

Hamas has accused the US of giving a green light for the Israeli “war of genocide and ethnic cleansing”.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he “deeply regrets” that military operations have started again in Gaza.

UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths renewed calls for a truce, saying Palestinians in the enclave have nowhere safe to go and “very little to survive on”.







The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces stopped alldeliveries of aidinto Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said aid deliveries must resume at the same frequency and scope that was allowed during the Israel-Hamas truce, even though “much more than that is needed”.

Israel has informed several Arab states that it wants to carve out a buffer zone on the Palestinian side of Gaza’s border to prevent future attacks as part of proposals for the enclave after the war ends, Egyptian and regional sources told Reuters.

The US has provided Israel with large bunker-buster bombs, among tens of thousands of other weapons and artillery shells, to help dislodge Hamas from Gaza, US officials told the Wall Street Journal.

Gaza Isreal War,"Israel’s war on Gaza is a health justice issue, too","This week, more than 40 organisations working on health justice around the globe put out an urgent call to the global health and human rights community. In anopen letter,we issued a call to global health bodies, health institutions, professional associations and the World Medical Association (WMA) to take immediate action on the Israeli government’s continuing onslaught on Gaza – because the war on Palestine is an issue of health justice, too.

Israel’s onslaught – which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled “plausibly” meets the conditions of genocide – has claimed the lives of more than30,000 Palestiniansin less than five months. This means that since October 7, the Israeli military has killed 250 Palestinians on average per day –a higher death ratethan any other 21st-century conflict. Additionally, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been wounded and over a million have been displaced.









Israel’s deliberate targeting of hospitals across Gaza – considered a war crime under international law – undoubtedly contributed to this staggering death toll. At the time of writing, only11 out of Gaza’s 35 hospitalsare partially functional.

Israel has destroyed much more than Gaza’s hospitals. The targeting of laboratories, other health facilities, ambulances, doctors, nurses and patients, coupled with the blockade on lifesaving medical supplies, has put a wrecking ball through Gaza’s entire health system and left 2.2 million people with little access to healthcare at a time they are facing near constant, indiscriminate bombardment and the threat of famine. Since the beginning of the war,at least 337 health workers have been killed, including two of only four pathologists in Gaza.

People suffering from chronic illnesses are unable to access vital medicines, and disease is spreading at an unprecedented rate amid a sanitation crisis caused by a severe lack of access to clean water. The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the state of healthcare in Gaza as being “beyond words”.

Research published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the United States and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in the United Kingdom suggests an escalation of the conflict could lead to nearly86,000 excess deathsover the next six months once the effects of war-induced disease, epidemics and malnutrition are accounted for. The report estimates that even if there is no escalation, and conditions remain as they are today, there will still be 66,720 excess deaths in Gaza over the next six months.

This is why, as activists, health workers and organisations working in the health sector for justice, equity, anti-racism and decolonisation, we are using our voices to speak up and urge as well as compel our colleagues and others, especially global health bodies and associations, to take action. As Israel uses healthcare, food and water as weapons of war, we know all too well – as organisations that have worked on issues of health justice and access to medicines for millions of people around the world – that it is imperative that we speak up and demand an end to impunity, and real action and consequences.

So why target our call to the global health community? We feel that there has been a widespread lack of regard by many in this community for the unfolding health crisis in Gaza. As we also noted in the open letter we published this week, hardly any discussion on the current state of health services in Gaza has graced the pages of the 17 global health journals that currently fill the public space. Our research shows that a PubMed search on journal articles containing the words “Global Health”, “Gaza” and “health” published since October 2023 retrieved only two, published by The Lancet and the British Medical Journal, that featured any discussion about the ethical, human rights and professional challenges that arose from the current conflict.

So we ask: why have our universities, medical schools, professional associations and academic bodies remained silent? Save for a few, isolated public statements, the response from those who we expect to maintain the highest medical and scientific professional and ethical standards around the world has been a deafening silence.

While the American Medical Association (AMA) rightfully issued, in 2022, a very strong condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an effort by some members to do the same for Israel’s war on Gaza in 2023 wasshut down. And at this stage of the genocide, any continued silence will be judged as complicity.

This demonstrates blatant double standards that can only be explained by racist dehumanisation of the Palestinian people.

A climate of virulent censorship, especially in the Global North, has also led to open victimisation of health workers and academics who dare to speak out in their personal capacity in defence of the rights of Palestinians and against racism. But we refuse to be silenced, and we call on the global health community at large to stand firm in the face of this intimidation.

We must call out Israel’s war crimes and unequivocally condemn the genocide that is under way in Gaza – and Israel’s long-standing medical apartheid in the occupied Palestinian territories – and support colleagues who are being targeted for speaking out about anti-Palestinian racism.

We must also pressure all governments to immediately resume and increase funding for the critical work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other agencies helping Palestinians in Gaza and elsewhere in occupied territory. We should refuse to collaborate with Israeli health institutions, universities, research councils, pharmaceutical companies and any organisations affiliated with the military in any form.

As health professionals and activists, we are obliged to speak out, both morally and professionally. We are also obliged to take whatever steps in our power to halt and prevent this genocide. To do anything less would be a complete dereliction of our duty to support and uphold the right – of everyone – to health.

Gaza Isreal War,Israel’s war on Gaza in 10 explainers,"As Israel’s war on Gaza continues into its fourth week, it can be difficult to keep pace of events, grappling with the multiple dimensions of a rapidly escalating conflict that has already caused so much devastation.

Since Hamas launched its lightning attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,405 people and taking at least 200 hostages, Israel unleashed the full force of its firepower on besieged Palestinians in the Gaza Strip – more than 7,000 people have now been killed and the death toll rises almost every hour.

Amid the chaos, a battle of narratives is also being waged, pitting Israel’s backers in the West against Palestinians and Middle Eastern nations that watched this catastrophe unfold at close quarters for the past 75 years. In this hot conflict, history matters.

Al Jazeera has been tackling the big questions about this asymmetrical war, to help you make sense of it.

Take a look at 10 must-read explainers:

The conflict did not start with the Hamas attack on October 7. It didn’t even start with the creation of Hamas.

As a first stop, we suggest our simple guide to the Israel-Palestine conflict, from Arthur Balfour to the Nakba. We walk you through landmark developments decade by decade, with video and visuals, to decode the decades of injustice, dispossession, displacement and humiliation that have brought the region to this moment.

You’ve read the reports on the group’s shock attack of October 7, the worst in Israel’s history. But what does the name “Hamas” actually mean? And how did this group, designated as a terrorist organisation by a number of countries, come to administer the lives of 2.3 million people in the Gaza Strip? What are its links with Iran, Syria and Lebanon’s Hezbollah?

Hamas might control Gaza, but the West Bank is governed – notionally, at least – by the Palestinian Authority (PA). The pair had a civil war, which led to the PA losing control over Gaza in 2007. Governing the shrinking West Bank, the body has all the trappings of a state, but no real power. Many are now asking what its future might be after the war.

As the war escalates, it is possible that Israel may end up doing battle not only in Gaza and the West Bank, but also on its northern border with Hezbollah in Lebanon. With the threat of a regional war looming, Justin Salhani traces the history of tortured relations between Israel and Lebanon, going right back to 1948 and the creation of Israel.

How did we get here? In three weeks, Israel’s intense bombing campaign has turned much of Gaza to rubble, killing thousands. But, as Indlieb Farazi Saber explains, the enclave was already struggling under a 16-year blockade before bombing turned an existing humanitarian disaster into a “catastrophe”.

The Rafah border crossing has a central role in enabling humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and for trapped people in Gaza who want to leave to escape to safety. But who controls this border? Why have negotiations been so tricky? And what are the implications of throwing it open? Al Jazeera’s Maziar Motamedi explains all.

The first casualty of war is truth. In the hours after the al-Ahli hospital explosion, which killed at least 400 people, Israel’s jumbled and verifiably faked version of events cast serious doubt on its claims that the disaster had been caused by a misfired rocket from Palestinian Islamic Jihad. But, as Al Jazeera explains, sowing confusion is all part of the playbook.

Al Jazeera’s Indlieb Farazi Saber asks psychologists about the mental toll that war exacts on its youngest victims — many of whom, in Gaza, have barely survived after being buried under rubble from buildings brought down by Israeli missiles.

How does trauma manifest in children? And do they stand any chance of recovery?

How are abuses against children even allowed to happen? Countless numbers of children have lost their homes, face shortages of food, water and medicine, their education disrupted for the foreseeable future. Areesha Lodhi explains how the Geneva Conventions, the basis for the laws of war, apply to children.

How will this war end? In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’s brutal attack and Israel’s no-limits counteroffensive, Al Jazeera took a look at the diplomatic chessboard to explain who might play a role in making peace. As the situation escalates, positions have oscillated. But the broad brushstrokes of alliances in the making are set out in this explainer.

Gaza Isreal War,UN officials say ‘atrocities must end’ in Gaza as Israeli raids kill dozens,"Leading United Nations officials have demanded “an end to the appalling human suffering and humanitarian catastrophe” in the Gaza Strip nearly one year into the war between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas.

“These atrocities must end,” they said on Monday in a statement signed by the heads of UN agencies that included the World Food Programme and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) along with other aid groups as world leaders gathered in New York for the annual UN General Assembly.

“Humanitarians must have safe and unimpeded access to those in need,” they said. “We cannot do our jobs in the face of overwhelming need and ongoing violence.”

The UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza duringthe warand distributing it amid “total lawlessness” in the besieged Palestinian enclave. Nearly 300 humanitarian aid workers, more than two-thirds of them UN staff, have been killed.

“The risk of famine persists with all 2.1 million residents still in urgent need of food and livelihood assistance as humanitarian access remains restricted,” the UN officials said.

“Healthcare has been decimated. More than 500 attacks on healthcare have been recorded in Gaza.”









At least 24 people have been killed and 60 wounded in Israeli military attacks in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the enclave’s Health Ministry said in a statement on Monday.

Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, said the increasingly desperate conditions in Gaza are “the byproducts of the intense bombing campaign”.

He added: “It is just hard to consider this a war because, since the beginning, it has been largely one-sided, dominated by the Israeli military, but we’re seeing it on a daily basis.”

The war in the Palestinian enclave began on October 7, 2023, after Hamas fighters stormed into Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 captives back to Hamas-run Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, Israel’s military has levelled swaths of the Palestinian enclave, killing more than 41,400 people, driving nearly all of its population from their homes, and giving rise to deadly hunger and disease, according to Palestinian health authorities.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/top-un-officials-say-atrocities-must-end-in-gaza-as-israel-kills-dozens,NEGATIVE,0.9407570958137512

Gaza Isreal War,Israel’s war on Gaza: Rights groups urge Biden to oppose threats to ICC,"Human rights groups are urging US President Joe Biden’s administration to oppose threats against the International Criminal Court (ICC) after its chief prosecutor’s decision to seek arrest warrants against Israeli officialsdrew ire in Washington.

In a letter to Biden that was made public on Thursday, more than 100 organisations from around the world called on the US government to “oppose any legislative efforts to undermine the ICC”.

“The ability of the ICC to provide justice for victims requires full respect for its independence. A selective approach to judicial decisions undermines the credibility, and ultimately, the force of the law as a shield against human rights violations and abuses,” theletterreads.

Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International USA and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights were among the signatories.

The letter was sent days after ICCProsecutor Karim Khan announcedon Monday that he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant as well as three senior Hamas officials.

Khan accused the Israeli leaders of bearing “criminal responsibility” for war crimes and crimes against humanity in relation to Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 35,500 Palestinians since early October.







Those alleged crimes include intentionalattacks against civilians, willful killings and starvation of civilians as a weapon of war, Khan said.

The announcement drew immediate anger from pro-Israel lawmakers from both the US Democratic and Republican parties, including Biden himself, who called Khan’s decision “outrageous”.

Some Republicans have gone further and have called on Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that would impose sanctions on ICC officials in response to the arrest warrant requests.

“It is imperative that the Senate, in a bipartisan way, comes up with crippling sanctions against the ICC – not only to support Israel but to deter any future action against American personnel,” Republican Senator Lindsey Grahamsaid on social media.

During acongressional hearingon Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested the Biden administration would be willing to work with lawmakers on legislation to penalise the international tribunal.

“I think we have to look at the appropriate steps to take to deal with, again, what is a profoundly wrongheaded decision,” the top US diplomat said.







Shortly after taking office in 2021, Bidenlifted US sanctions against ICC officialsthat had been imposed by his Republican predecessor Donald Trump as part of the Democratic president’s push to re-engage with international institutions after Trump’s presidency.

“Our support for the rule of law, access to justice, and accountability for mass atrocities are important US national security interests that are protected and advanced by engaging with the rest of the world to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” the Biden administrationsaid at the time.

But the Biden administration has providedunequivocal diplomatic and military supportfor Israel during the Gaza war despite widespread criticism and calls to condition US aid to the top Middle East ally.

The US provides at least $3.8bn in military aid to Israel each year, and it has provided additional assistance during the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

At the same time, the US has had a fraught relationship with the ICC, which was established under the Rome Statute to investigate war crimes, crimes against humanity and other atrocities.

Neither the US nor Israel are parties to the Rome Statute and neither recognise the jurisdiction of the court.

Palestine, a nonmember observer state at the United Nations, formally accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction in 2015, extending the court’s authority to investigate atrocities committed in the occupied Palestinian territory.

In Thursday’s letter, the rights groups called on the Biden administration “to ensure that any disagreement about the Court’s process is pursued through proper judicial channels under the Court’s treaty”.

“We welcomed press statements by your administration in recent weeks indicating that it does not support ‘threats or intimidation’ of ICC officials,” the letter reads.

“We urge you to oppose any legislative efforts to undermine the ICC, and to make clear that regardless of its views on specific ICC investigations, the United States continues to support independent international justice mechanisms.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/23/israels-war-on-gaza-rights-groups-urge-biden-to-oppose-threats-to-icc,NEGATIVE,0.8926987648010254

Gaza Isreal War,In numbers: 200 days of Israel’s war on Gaza,"Mass graves, crippled hospitals, thousands of civilian deaths and near total destruction of infrastructure haunt Gaza as Israel’s war on the besieged Palestinian coastal enclave entered its 200th day on Tuesday.

Israel launched its brutal military offensive on October 7 after a deadly attack by Hamas fighters. About 240 people were taken captive in southern Israel and 1,139 were killed by the Palestinian fighters. Nearly 85 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced and more than 14,000 children have been killed in the offensive, which critics have called a war of vengeance.

Here are some numbers that highlight the unprecedented level of violence used in the past six months while Israel remains adamant about launching a ground offensive in Rafah. The southernmost city in Gaza is sheltering 1.5 million Palestinians, most of whom fled earlier phases of the war.

According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, at least 34,183 people have been killed and 77,084 have been wounded in Israeli attacks.

About 72 percent of those killed are women and children, according to an update by Gaza’s Government Media Office on Tuesday.

On Monday, United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said a child in Gaza iskilled or wounded“every 10 minutes”.

Meanwhile,7,000 people are missing, according to the Government Media Office, many presumed dead under the rubble.

“We have seen death over the last 200 days at an unprecedented scale,” said Emily Tripp, director of the London-based nonprofit Airwars, which tracks casualties in aerial bombardments during war. “We have now identified more incidents where civilians have been killed since October 7 in Gaza than we did in eight years of the US and allied campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

“We have documented strikes where more than 100 people have been killed – and the news barely reaches international headlines,” she told Al Jazeera.

In areportpublished in late March, Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, said there were clear indications that Israel has violated three of the five acts listed under the UN Genocide Convention.

These acts Albanese said were “killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to the group’s members; and deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”.

Many residential areas across Gaza have been destroyed and ruined by relentless bombing. At least 75,000 tonnes of explosives have been dropped on Gaza by Israeli forces, according to the Gaza media office.

This month, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, also known as UNRWA, said62 percent of all housesin the besieged territory have been damaged or destroyed.

Nearly 90,000 housing units have been destroyed while nearly 300,000 units have been damaged by the Israeli air and ground offensive, according to the Gaza media office.

A World Bank and UN report published on April 2 said the cost of damage to critical infrastructure in the first four months of Israel’s war is estimated at $18.5bn.

About 1.1 million people — half of Gaza’s pre-war population — are living through catastrophic food insecurity, the world’s hunger watchdog, known as the Integrated Food-Security Phase Classification (IPC), said in a report published on March 18. Catastrophic food insecurity, the IPC’s worst level of food insecurity, refers to conditions in which starvation and acute malnutrition are evident.

In northern Gaza, famine is likely to occur by May and could spread across the enclave by July, the report added.

According to the IPC, famine is defined as when at least 20 percent of households are facing an extreme lack of food, at least 30 percent of children are suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two adults or four children for every 10,000 people are dying every day from outright starvation or a combination of malnutrition and disease.

The Gaza media office on Tuesday said at least 30 children have died “as a result of famine”. It said 1.09 million people have been infected with diseases as a result of being displaced in the coastal enclave.

Moreover, the war in the coastal enclave has hampered the work of aid agencies such as UNRWA.

The UN has said more than200 aid workershave been killed during the war, most of them Palestinians.

As of March 16, UNRWA saidat least 180of its staff have been killed since October 7.

Israeli forces have repeatedly targeted hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including besieging some of its biggest health facilities.

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on March 30saidonly 10 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals were “minimally functional”.

Tlaleng Mofokeng, the UN special rapporteur on the right to health, on Mondaysaid at least350 healthcare professionals have been killed since October 7 with 520 wounded, adding that the numbers were “grossly underreported”.

Mofokeng said Israel’s war in Gaza has from the start been a “war on the right to health” and has “obliterated” the health system in the coastal enclave.

The Gaza media office on Tuesday said 485 medical staff have been killed since the war began.

“The destruction of healthcare facilities continues to catapult to proportions yet to be fully quantified,” Mofokeng, a doctor from South Africa, said.

In recent months, some of Gaza’s most renowned health facilities were besieged by Israeli forces. Last week, nearly 300 bodies were retrieved from a mass grave found inside Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis weeks after Israeli forces withdrew.

This month, bodies were also uncovered at Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital, which was besieged by Israeli forces for weeks.

The United States has vetoed UN Security Council resolutionscalling for ceasefire on three occasionssince October 7 while a fourth truce resolution was blocked by Algeria, Russia and China.

On March 23, the three countries vetoed a US-drafted resolution, which Moscow said was a “hypocritical spectacle” that did not pressure Israel.

On March 25, the US decided not to veto a ceasefire resolution by abstaining from the vote. The resolution called for an immediate ceasefire for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Israel has failed to stop its war despite the resolution.

The US has consistently backed Israel at the UN while also supplying a major chunk of weapons to the country. The US House of Representative approved $26bn in aid to Israel at the weekend. The legislation is now being considered by the Senate.

Gaza Isreal War,The human toll of Israel’s war on Gaza – by the numbers,"It has been 467 days since Israel began its war against Palestinians in Gaza. That’s more than 15 months of daily bombardments, death, injuries, displacement and starvation.

The Israeli onslaught began on October 7, 2023, after attacks on southern Israel led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

More than 1,100 people were killed in the attacks, and about 240 were taken captive. Many of the captives were either freed in a prisoner exchange in November 2023 or were killed during subsequent Israeli attacks.

Israel began a brutal onslaught with air raids after the attacks and further tightened its blockade on the enclave, which has been in place since 2007.

In the past 15 months, at least 46,707 people in Gaza have been killed, which includes about 18,000 children. The death toll means that one out of every 50 people has been killed in Gaza. Many analysts and rights groups believe the real number killed is far higher.



Despite global condemnations and pleas from international organisations and rights groups, Israel has continued a collective punishment campaign on the besieged enclave, where half of the population is under the age of 18. In doing so, Israel has wiped out multiple generations of families from the civil registry.

At least 110,265 people have been injured in Gaza as a result of the war. That’s one in 20 people.

According to the World Health Organization, nearly a quarter of the injured, an estimated 22,500 people, have life-altering injuries that require but are not receiving rehabilitation. Severe limb injuries are the main type of injury needing rehabilitation.

According to UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, every day 10 children lose one or both legs with operations and amputations conducted with little or no anaesthesia due to Israel’s blockade.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health stated that by the end of 2024 there had been at least4,500 amputations.



In addition to the confirmed casualties, thousands of people are feared buried under the rubble. With few tools to remove the rubble and rescue those trapped beneath concrete, volunteers and Palestinian Civil Defence workers rely on their bare hands. There is no way to know how many people have perished under the rubble.

An estimated 85,000 tonnes of explosives have been dropped on Gaza, according to the Environmental Quality Authority of Palestine. Experts predicted it could take more than a decade to clear the debris left by the bombing, which totals more than 42 million tonnes, according to the UN Development Programme. On top of the work of clearing the rubble is the risk of dealing with unexploded bombs.

Under the Rome Statute, a treaty that established the International Criminal Court, intentionally starving a population is a war crime when committed during an armed conflict.

An investigation by Al Jazeera’sFault Linesfound that Israel has systematically denied aid and water to starving people in Gaza.

In January, the United Nations humanitarian agency stated that efforts to supply aid in Gaza are at a“breaking point”.

Israel restricts aid deliveries and has carried out attacks on aid workers, creating a starving people heavily reliant on external help.

At least eight babies have also died of hypothermia as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive in shelters inadequate for winter weather.



Nearly 1.9 million people in Gaza are internally displaced, of which nearly 80 percent are living in makeshift shelters without adequate clothing or protection from the cold.

UN agencies estimated that nearly half a million are in flood-prone areas. Authorities in Gaza said about 110,000 of the 135,000 tents being used as shelters in the Gaza Strip are worn out and not fit for use.

Gaza Isreal War,Will Israel’s war on Gaza sway South Africa’s election?,"Cape Town, South Africa –“We cannot allow supporters of baby killers to talk to us,” a furious resident of Surrey Estate in Cape Town shouted as he heckled the speaker at the podium.

The man was one of hundreds of residents of the mostly Muslim suburb who had gathered for a pre-election panel discussion early in May, where representatives from 10 political parties sought to lobby support.

When Riad Davids, the representative for the Democratic Alliance (DA) – South Africa’s liberal, centrist main opposition party that is considered a steadfast supporter of Israel – took to the podium to make his pitch to residents, he was booed.

The audience shouted and jeered, preventing him from delivering his message and seeking to force him off the stage.

The South African government’ssupport for Palestinehas become a common theme in debates leading up to the May 29 general elections and expressions of solidarity with the people of Gaza have featured during the campaigns of various political parties.

The governing centre-left African National Congress (ANC), which has historical links with Palestine, has publicly condemned human rights violations under Israeli occupation and has taken Israel to theInternational Court of Justice(ICJ) accusing it of genocide in its war on Gaza.

The official opposition DA, however, did not support the government’s decision to haul Israel to the ICJ and has been criticised by some for its stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict since the war began in October.

Although the DA has historically shown support for Israel, it says its position is one of neutrality.

“The DA stands in solidarity with both Palestinians and Israelis who seek a two-state solution. The DA stands against radicalism and violence. We reject any sentiment that seeks to annihilate either Israel or Palestine. We embrace rationality based on peaceful co-existence for both a secure Israel and a free Palestinian state. We embrace the right of both Palestinians and Israelis to statehood and sovereignty,” the party said in a statement following the October 7 attacks.

In the Western Cape, where the DA has governed for the last 15 years, the party has enjoyed support from working-class majority Muslim areas like Surrey Estate.

But in this instance, the disdain from the community was palatable as angry residents insisted that the DA was complicit in condoning genocide in Gaza.

“It is sad that in a Muslim area, where we have a Muslim audience, you want to deny someone the opportunity to speak,” Davids pleaded with the audience.

As he persisted, the angrier the crowd became with loud chants of “free, free Palestine” ringing in the community hall. Two Palestinian flags were waved every time the crowd heckled him.

While the angry residents of Surrey Estate were venting their frustration at the DA representative, a few kilometres away in the suburb of Rylands, another working-class majority Muslim suburb in Cape Town, President Cyril Ramaphosa was addressing residents at a public meeting.

There, the president arrived wearing a keffiyeh and maintained an unapologetic position for the ANC’s support for the people of Palestine.

Ramaphosa said his government will look at visa waivers to make it easier for Palestinians travelling to South Africa.

“We will make an exception so that our brothers and sisters from Palestine can come here, not only as refugees but for a variety of reasons,” he said to applause.

In the question and answer session with the president, ANC member of parliament and grandson of former president Nelson Mandela, Mandla Mandela, asked Ramaphosa why local authorities have not arrested South Africans who have been found fighting in the Israeli army. The president pledged that his government would take action.

The community’s fervent support for Palestine was also on full display with many in the crowd wearing Palestinian colours as they listened to Ramaphosa wooing them.

“The ANC stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine,” read the banners on stage behind the president.

It was not an unusual sight. The ANC has consistently expressed its solidarity with Palestine during election campaign events.

This past weekend, the ruling party and government representatives also participated in the first Global Anti-Apartheid Conference for Palestine held in Johannesburg, which aimed to hold Israel accountable for its crimes against the Palestinian people.

At the event, international relations and cooperation minister, Naledi Pandor, reiterated the government’s view that Israel perpetuates apartheid against the Palestinians and called for tougher action against it.

“There can never be peace if the Palestinian people are not free … We should be ashamed that 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza,” she said during the conference attended by government representatives and activists.

Days earlier, during a national May Day rally commemorating Workers’ Day, the ANC led a march in Cape Town in solidarity with Palestinians.

“You, as workers, need to join this fight to fight for those who are oppressed around the world. And today as South Africa, we have stood up for the rights of those in other parts of the world [who] are currently being subjected to torture, to violence and genocide,” Ramaphosa implored the country’s workers.

“And that is why as a country and yes, as an alliance, we have stood firm in our support for the people of Palestine. And that is why we say ‘we want Palestine to be free’,” he said to applause.

The ANC has long compared Israel’s policies against Palestinians to the brutal apartheid regime’s actions against Black South Africans before democracy in 1994.

However, some have more cynically suggested that the party was further leveraging the issue this time around to help it gain support among certain groups of voters.

While the ANC may benefit electorally from its support of Palestine, its position on the issue has been consistent, an analyst told Al Jazeera.

Imraan Buccus, an academic and researcher at Auwal Socio-economic Research Institute, said the ANC’s vocal support for Palestine was a principled stance and part of historical solidarity between the two countries’ liberation movements.

“The ANC is not opportunistically trying to use the genocide in Palestine for votes.

“That is an irresponsible narrative,” he added.

However, Herman Mashaba, an opposition leader with ActionSA – a right-leaning political party – disagreed, saying the ANC was hypocritical and its attempts to focus on Gaza were a distraction from the myriad problems facing South Africa.

“The ANC motive is not about the Palestinian people. It’s about diverting attention from the issues facing South Africa,” he said, noting that more than 80 people are killed every day in South Africa, which is one of the most violent countries in the world.

“It does not make sense. If I look at the energy they [are] providing to domestic issues compared to the energy they have on international issues it does not add up.”

Regarding ActionSA’s position on Palestine, Mashaba said that while he called for a solution to the conflict, he believed South Africa should not focus its attention on international crises while its own house “was on fire”.

This sentiment was expressed by another opposition party leader, Gayton McKenzie, who heads the Patriotic Alliance (PA) – described by analysts as a right-wing populist party.

He angered Cape Town residents at another election town hall meeting when he pointed to South Africa’s crime rates when asked about his support for Palestine.

“Hey, our children die more than in Palestine. Do not tell me about Palestine here. Go to Palestine; this is not Palestine,” he said, prompting anger from the audience.

McKenzie has unapologetically supported Israel and was quoted on social media as saying: “My Bible commands me to stand with Israel, my Bible tells me if you curse Israel you are cursing himself. I will listen to the Bible.”

The far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party and former President Jacob Zuma’s uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party have meanwhile vocally supported Palestine while the right-wing Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has remained neutral on the matter.

A small Muslim-focused party, Al Jama-ah, which has one seat in Parliament, has centred its election campaign around its support for Palestine.

Analyst Buccus said in previous elections, South Africa’s foreign policy did not determine voting patterns.

However, this election was different given the persisting“genocide”in Gaza.

“It will definitely impact this election,” he said, adding that working-class Muslim voters in Cape Town and other areas who often proudly voted DA may now rethink their support.

Gaza Isreal War,More than $50bn needed to rebuild Gaza after Israel’s war on enclave,"Reconstruction efforts in Gaza will require more than $50bn after 15 months of Israel’s devastating war, according to a new assessment by the United Nations, the European Union and the World Bank.

The figures come as Arab countries continue to scramble to find a viable recovery plan as an alternative to the mass displacement of the Palestinian enclave’s 2 million residents proposed by United States President Donald Trump.

The Gaza & West Bank Interim Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (IRDNA), published on Tuesday, calculated that Israel’s war on Gaza caused $49bn in destruction between October 8, 2023 and October 8, 2024.

Researchers concluded that $53.2bn is now needed for the recovery and reconstruction of the Palestinian territory over the next 10 years, with about $20bn of the full amount required in the first three years alone.

“Funding will require a broad coalition of donors, diverse financing instruments, private sector resources, and significant improvements in the delivery of reconstruction materials to Gaza in the post-conflict period,” the joint report states.

More than half the total estimated cost of rebuilding, or $29.9bn, is needed for damaged buildings and other key infrastructure, while funds to replenish Gaza’s destroyed residential housing stock form the bulk of that figure – $15.2bn.

Housing suffered the most during Israel’s 15-month-long attack on the territory, with the report writers estimating that it accounted for 53 percent of the total destruction wrought by Israeli forces in Gaza, amounting to more than 292,000 homes destroyed or damaged.

Another $19.1bn is required to make up for social and economic losses resulting from severe damage to Gaza’s health, education, commerce and industry sectors, the report estimates.

The researchers also state that 95 percent of Gaza’s hospitals are now non-functional, while the local economy has contracted by 83 percent.

The IRDNA is a follow-up to theInterim Damage Assessment (IDA)published by the UN, EU and World Bank in April 2024, which estimated about $18.5bn in damages after just four months of Israel’s war.

Years of clearing unexploded ordnance and removing millions of tonnes of rubble also lie ahead as part of the reconstruction efforts.







The report’s findings come amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with the Israeli military accused of carrying outrepeated violationsof the truce since it came into effect on January 19.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also failed to rule out areturn to warin the coastal enclave if Hamas does not continue to return all the captives it holds there.

The report’s authors therefore cautioned that conditions are not yet in place for large-scale recovery and reconstruction work to begin given the lack of clarity over Gaza’s future, not least how it will be governed.

“The speed, scale, and scope of recovery will be shaped by these conditions,” the report states.

Since returning to the White House in late January, Trump has said he would“take over” and “own”Gaza, which involves emptying the Strip of its inhabitants and transforming the territory into what Trump described as the “Riviera of the Middle East”.

As part of this plan, Trump has said he would permanently displace 2 million Palestinian people. He has pressured both Jordan and Egypt to take in those who are forced out of Gaza.

Netanyahu has expressed strong support for Trump’s proposal, and his government announced on Monday that it had formed a special directorate for the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians from the coastal enclave.







Egypt is leading the way on an alternative Arab-led reconstruction plan that would keep Gaza’s population in their homeland.

On Monday, Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs Badr Abdelatty said Cairo is “actively developing a comprehensive,multi-phase planfor Gaza’s early recovery and reconstruction”.

Crucially, Cairo says the plan would not require Gaza’s population to be displaced. Instead, “secure areas” would be established where Palestinians can live, while dozens of Egyptian and international construction firms remove and rehabilitate the Strip’s war-torn infrastructure.

That plan may see up to $20bn provided by Arab and Gulf states towards reconstruction efforts, the Reuters news agency reported on Tuesday, citing two anonymous Egyptian security sources with knowledge of the matter.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi will travel to the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, on Thursday to discuss the plan before an Arab summit will be held in Cairo on March 4 to potentially finalise the proposal, Reuters said.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was waiting to evaluate Egypt’s plan.

But he reiterated Israel’s long-held stance that any plan in which Hamas continued to have a political or military presence in Gaza would not be acceptable.

Gaza Isreal War,Will the UN ceasefire resolution stop Israel’s war on Gaza?,"After more than five months of fighting and five vetoed draft resolutions, United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members on Monday successfullypassed a resolutioncalling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The United States abstained from voting while the remaining 14 UNSC members voted in favour of the resolution, which was proposed by the 10 elected members of the council.



The resolution calls for an “immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan respected by all parties leading to a lasting, sustainable ceasefire”.

It additionally calls for the release of the Israeli captives taken by Hamas on October 7. It emphasises the need for more humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza and on adherence to international law.

While promising at least a pause in the war, the resolution has been criticised by some analysts for being more symbolic than substantial in its ability to bring an end to the war. Nancy Okail, the president of the US-based think tank Center for International Policy,toldAl Jazeera’s Ali Harb that while the resolution is significant, it is “still very late and still not enough”.

All UNSC resolutions are considered binding, in accordance with Article 25 of the UN Charter which was ratified by the US.

However, the US has described the Monday resolution as non-binding. US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington fully supported “some of the critical objectives in this non-binding resolution”. On the same day, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters: “It is a non-binding resolution”.

This has been contested by other UN officials andSecurity Council members. China’s UN ambassador Zhang Jun said that Security Council resolutions are binding.

Deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq added that UNSC resolutions are international law, “so to that extent they are as binding as international law is”.

The Anadolu Agency reported that Pedro Comissario, Mozambique’s UN ambassador, said “all United Nations Security Council resolutions are binding and mandatory”.

If a UNSC resolution is not followed, the council can vote on a follow-up resolution addressing the breach and take punitive action in the form of sanctions or even the authorisation of an international force.

Al Jazeera’s Diplomatic Editor James Bays haspreviously saidthat “There are virtually no circumstances under which the Biden administration would support a punitive resolution” that takes action against Israel.

Israel has repeatedly gotten away with flouting UN resolutions in the past.

In December 2016, during the last days of Barack Obama’s presidential term in the US, the UNSC passed a resolution deeming Israel’ssettlementsin Palestine illegal and a violation ofinternational law. The resolution passed with 14 votes and the US abstained. Israel ignored this resolution.

More recently, in December 2023, the UN General Assembly voted with an overwhelming majority to call for a “humanitarian ceasefire”. That was a non-binding resolution – and Israel refused to act on it.

Israel is alsounder the scannerof the International Court of Justice (ICJ), where South Africa has accused it of committing acts of genocide in Gaza.

The resolution calls for an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan. However, sinceRamadanends around April 9, the ceasefire demand – even if implemented now – would last for just two weeks.

The document says that the immediate ceasefire in Ramadan should then lead to a lasting and sustainable ceasefire. Shortly before the vote on Monday, the word “permanent” was dropped from the resolution to try to build consensus on the text. Russia tried to push for the use of the word “permanent,” saying that not using the word could allow Israel “to resume its military operation in the Gaza Strip at any moment” afterRamadan.

The change has been made (see red text).https://t.co/6K3f3kABYypic.twitter.com/pcDwqT8n0b

The US has also not halted the supply of military aid to Israel and has insisted that its commitment to Israel’s security remains firm. In fact, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Monday: “Our vote does not – and I repeat that, does not – represent a shift in our policy”.

The US abstention at the UNSC today as well as Netanyahu's reaction to it should be seen as each leader's attempt to manage domestic audiences. What matters is Biden signed off on $4billion more in weapons for Israel to further the genocide.

Keep your eye on the ball.

Adraft resolutionwas put forth by the US before the council last Friday and the members voted on it. It was vetoed by Russia and China; Algeria voted against it and Guyana abstained. Eleven members voted in favour of this draft resolution.

The resolution did not demand a ceasefire, but instead supported “international diplomatic efforts to establish an immediate and sustained ceasefire as part of a deal that releases the hostages”.

In a press statement on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken added that the US wants any demands of a ceasefire to be tied to the release of Israeli captives.

The Friday resolution also urged UNSC member states to “suppress the financing of terrorism, including by restricting financing of Hamas”. The resolution also condemned Hamas and noted that Hamas “has been designated as a terrorist organisation by numerous member states”. Blinken’s statement further said that the resolution that passed on Monday failed to condemn Hamas, which is key language that the US views as essential.

Israel has criticised Monday’s resolution for not tying a ceasefire to the release of captives – and instead for the two to each happen separately.

The US abstained on Monday after vetoing three previous draft resolutions calling for a ceasefire.

Heightened tensions between the US and Israel were seen on Monday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a trip by a delegation to Washington. This was described as “surprising and unfortunate” by State Department spokesperson Miller.

However, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant is in the US: He met Blinken on Monday and is scheduled to meet US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Tuesday. Blinken told Gallant to refrain from a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah.

While the US reiterated that its policy remains consistent, the official Prime Minister of Israel X handle posted on Monday night: “The United States has abandoned its policy in the UN today”.

Prime Minister’s Office Statement:

The United States has abandoned its policy in the UN today. Just a few days ago, it supported a Security Council resolution that linked a call for a ceasefire to the release of hostages.

— Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM)March 25, 2024



It added to a thread of posts: “Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear last night that should the US depart from its principled policy and not veto this harmful resolution, he will cancel the Israeli delegation’s visit to the United States.”







Gaza is on the brink of starvation, with at least 32, 000 Palestinians killed. “This resolution must be implemented,” posted UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on X.

Gaza Isreal War,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.

Al Jazeera is an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government.
