Operation Sindoor,Operation Sindoor: What’s the significance of India’s Pakistan targets?,"The Indian military launchedmultiple missile attackstargeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early on Wednesday in an attack it calledOperation Sindoor. The Pakistani military claims to have retaliated, shooting down multiple Indian military planes.

At least31 Pakistanishave been killed in the six targeted cities, according to Lieutenant Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) media wing of Pakistan’s military. India says it struck nine sites.

But what’s the significance of the cities and sites that India attacked? And what are India and Pakistan saying about those strikes? And why did India launch these attacks in the first place?

The missiles were India’s response to the deadlyApril 22 attackon tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir inPahalgam, during which 26 men were killed.

An armed group calledThe Resistance Front (TRF), which demands independence for Kashmir, claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack. India claims that the TRF is an offshoot of Pakistan-based armed group, theLashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Islamabad has denied its involvement in the Pahalgam attack and has asked for a neutral investigation into the incident.

However, since the attack, India has suspended its participation in theIndus Waters Treatythat Pakistan relies on for its water supply. Pakistan has responded by threatening to suspend its participation in theSimla Agreement, a pact signed in1972 following the Indo-Pakistan War. Both countries have alsoscaled backtheir diplomatic ties, and each has expelled the other’s citizens.







India claims it hit “terrorist infrastructure”, targeting organisations including the LeT andJaish-e-Muhammad(JeM), an armed group based in Pakistan which claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in February 2019, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers inPulwamain Indian-administered Kashmir.

In a briefing on Wednesday, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri insisted that the missile strikes “focused on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists likely to be sent across to India”.

Joining Misri in the briefing, Indian military officials Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh detailed the operation. Five of the nine sites that India hit, they said, were in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The remaining four were in Punjab – in Bahawalpur, Muridke, Shakar Garh and a village near Sialkot.

During the briefing, the Indian military showed a map marking out what it claimed were 21 “terrorist camps” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Al Jazeera has not been able to independently verify the claims of either the Indian or Pakistani militaries.

Chaudhry of the ISPR described the Indian strikes as an “unprovoked attack, targeting innocent people”. He indicated that India had launched a total of 24 strikes across six locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Chaudhry said at least 31 civilians, including women and children, had been killed, and dozens more were injured. He claimed mosques and residential areas were targeted, killing and injuring civilians.



The Indian missile strikes represent the most extensive attacks on Pakistani soil outside the four wars that the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought. They also mark the first time since the war of 1971 that India has attacked Punjab, Pakistan’s most populated province and historical and economic hub.

Unlike previous aerial attacks by India in Pakistan or in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, some of these strikes targeted large population centres. Muridke is next to Lahore, Pakistan’s second-most populous city. Sialkot and Bahawalpur are major cities, too.

But many of thesites chosen as targetsby India also hold specific strategic importance, at least from New Delhi’s perspective. Here’s a breakdown:

Muridke is a city in Punjab’s Sheikhupura District, peppered with totems of historical memory from the Mughal, Mauryan and Gupta eras.

Chaudhry said a mosque named Masjid Ummul Qura was targeted with four strikes. One man was killed and one man was injured as a result. Two people have been missing from this location, Chaudhry said, adding that surrounding residential quarters have also been damaged in these attacks.

But the town, according to India and much of the international community, also hosts the headquarters of the Jamat-ud-Dawa, a charity organisation that New Delhi insists is a front for the LeT.

On Wednesday, India’s Qureshi claimed that Indian missiles struck the LeT’s Markaz Taiba camp in Muridke. The Indian army claimed that key perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attack – includingAjmal Kasab, the sole gunman who was captured alive after that assault on India’s financial capital – were trained at that camp.

Meanwhile, images emerging from Muridke showed rescuers searching for victims amid the debris of a damaged government health and education complex.

Chaudhry said that four Indian missiles struck Ahmedpur Sharqia, a town near Bahawalpur, targeting a mosque named Masjid Subhan, which was destroyed in the attack. He said that at least five people were killed in the attack, including two men, two women, and a three-year-old girl. Additionally, he said, 31 people were injured – 25 men and six women. He added that four “residential quarters”, where civilian families were living, were damaged.

But Qureshi said India had hit the headquarters of the JeM, called Markaz Subhanallah. India described the site as a hub for “recruitment, training and indoctrination”.

Muzaffarabad is the capital city of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, located at the confluence of the Jhelum and Neelum rivers. Muzaffarabad is sustained by its cottage industry ecosystem, including furniture making, wood carving, garment making and embroidery work, according to the State Bank of Pakistan.

Chaudhry said that a mosque called Masjid e Bilal was hit in Muzaffarabad, and a “young girl was injured”.

But Qureshi said India hit a LeT training centre, Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km (19 miles) away from the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that separates Indian-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She claimed that those responsible for multiple attacks, including the April 22 Pahalgam killings, were trained at this camp.

The Indian military officials also said they attacked a Jaish-e-Muhammad “staging area”, the Syedna Bilal camp in Muzaffarabad. A staging area refers to a place where people, vehicles and equipment are assembled and readied before being assigned a mission.

Kotli is a city along the Poonch river and is an agricultural and tourist hub.

Chaudhry said a mosque named Masjid Abbas was targeted in Kotli. A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy were killed. At least two other people were injured, he added.

Qureshi, however, said that India hit a LeT base, Gulpur camp, about 30km (19 miles) away from the LoC. The Indian army added that it also struck what it called the Abbas camp in Kotli, 13km (8 miles) away from the LoC, where Qureshi said up to 15 “terrorists” could be trained at a time.

Qureshi said India has also hit Mehmoona Joya, which she described as a facility of theHizbul Mujahideen (HuM), a rebel group based in Indian-administered Kashmir. The HuM was founded by separatist leader Muhammad Ahsan Dar in September 1989, with a pro-Pakistan ideology, calling for India to leave the parts of Kashmir that it administers.

Qureshi claimed India struck what India called the Barnala camp in Bhimber, about 9km (5.6 miles) away from the LoC. She claimed that fighters were trained in using weapons, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and in jungle survival at this camp.

Pakistani officials had not mentioned Bhimber as the site of any of the Indian attacks by late Wednesday evening. However, Bhimber is just south of Kotli, so it is unclear whether a missile strike on Bhimber is being counted by Pakistan as among the attacks on Kotli.

Sialkot is one of Pakistan’s most important industrial centres for the manufacture of surgical items, sporting goods and leather products.

Chaudhry said that a village north of Sialkot called Kotli Loharan was targeted in two strikes. One of these strikes misfired and did not explode, while the other landed in an open field, resulting in no damage, Chaudhry said.

India’s Qureshi and Singh, however, claimed that India had struck what they called the Sarjal camp in Sialkot. They claimed this was the training centre for those responsible for thekilling of four police officersin March this year in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Chaudhry said Shakar Garh was targeted with two strikes and reported “minor damage” to a “small hospital, a dispensary”.

However, Indian military officials have not mentioned Shakar Garh among the places targeted in the May 7 strikes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/operation-sindoor-whats-the-significance-of-indias-pakistan-targets,NEGATIVE,0.9963746666908264
Operation Sindoor,"India launches Operation Sindoor, exchanges heavy fire with Pakistan","India’s military has launchedOperation Sindoor, striking nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, prompting swift retaliation from Islamabad in the worst fighting in more than two decades between the nuclear-armed neighbours as fears of a wider, prolonged war grow.

Pakistan said on Wednesday that at least 26 people were killed and 46 others injured in the Indian attacks, accusing New Delhi of committing an “act of war”. India said at least eight people were killed by Pakistani shelling.

The leaders of both countries are holding crisis meetings on Wednesday.

The Indian strike and counterattack by Pakistan come amid soaring tensions, after adeadly attacklast month on tourists in Indian-administeredKashmirthat New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, which denied any involvement.

In a statement early on Wednesday, India’s government said its military had attacked “terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed”.

“Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,” it said.

The missiles struck locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the country’s eastern Punjab province.

Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Islamabad, said the cities of Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, were among the targets of the Indian strikes.

“Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking to a foreign TV network, confirmed that at least five Indian aircraft have been shot down and that a number of Indian soldiers have been taken prisoner,” Hyder said.

“Pakistan said that it would respond to any Indian attack against Pakistan, and Pakistan is now responding to that Indian attack,” he said.

“Heavy shelling has now resumed on the Line of Control that separates Pakistan-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir,” he added.

A Pakistani military spokesman had earlier told the broadcaster Geo that at least five locations, including two mosques, had been hit. He also said that Pakistan’s response was under way, without providing details.

In Punjab, missiles hit a mosque in the city of Bahawalpur, killing a child and wounding two civilians, the military said.

International Crisis Group’s Senior Analyst for India, Praveen Donthi, says that the “escalation between India and Pakistan has already reached a larger scale than during the last major crisis in 2019” with “potentially dire consequences”.

“Domestic emotions are high on both sides, fuelling the danger of further escalation,” he said, but “India and Pakistan should choose diplomacy, as any further military action carries unacceptable risks.”







Following India’s attacks, the armies of the two sides exchanged intense shelling and heavy gunfire across their frontier indisputed Kashmirin at least three places, the Reuters news agency reported, quoting police and witnesses.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint from both sides.

“The secretary-general is very concerned about the Indian military operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls for maximum military restraint from both countries,” Guterres’s spokesperson said.

“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan.”

United States President Donald Trump said the clashes were “a shame”.

“I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said at the White House.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he is also closely monitoring the situation, adding that he hopes it will end “quickly”.

The eruption of violence comes amid heightened tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, in the aftermath of anattackon tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir last month.

India blamed Pakistan for the violence, in which26 men were killed, and promised to respond. Pakistan denied that it had anything to do with the killings.

Nitasha Kaul, the director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy at the University of Westminster, London, said the strikes are “very concerning”.

“Once again, the worst affected are going to be the people in the region, the Kashmiris, who are caught between the competing and proprietorial and rival postures and attitudes of India and Pakistan,” Kaul told Al Jazeera.

Still, she said, the escalation is “not that surprising, because within India … there has been a domestic pressure building up for a more militarist response, given the fact that there is a particularly hyper-nationalist government in power.

“In that sense, sadly, this was a countdown to a greater escalation, and hopefully it won’t proceed much further beyond what has already happened with these strikes,” Kaul added.

Operation Sindoor,Why did India strike Pakistan? All we know about Operation Sindoor,"Islamabad, Pakistan –Parts of Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir were rocked bymultiple missile attacksby India early on Wednesday morning, in which at least 31 people, including a three-year-old child, died.

Pakistan’s military saidIndian missilesstruck six cities. That included four different places in Punjab province — the first time that India has hit Pakistan’s most populous state since the 1971 war between the neighbours. The remaining two places targeted were Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.









India claimed that its “Operation Sindoor” targeted nine sites with “terrorist infrastructure”.

Pakistan scrambled its jets in response and claimed it had brought down five Indian planes – an assertion to which India has not yet responded.

The Indian attack came 15 days after the deadly attack on tourists in the picturesquePahalgamtown in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22, for which India blamed armed groups which it claimed were backed by Pakistan. Islamabad denied any role in that attack.

Now, the nuclear-armed neighbours stand on the precipice of a full-blown military conflict.

Here is what we know about India’s attack, Pakistan’s response, and the background of this conflict so far.

Pakistani military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in an early morning news conference, said Indian missiles targeted four locations in Punjab and two in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

The attack took place at about 1am on Wednesday (20:00 GMT, Tuesday).

The biggest attack was in Ahmedpur Sharqia, near Bahawalpur city in Punjab. According to Chaudhry, a mosque compound was hit and at least five people were killed, including a three-year-old girl.

Other attacks took place in Muridke city, a village near the city of Sialkot, and Shakar Garh, all in Punjab.

Two locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir – Muzaffarabad and Kotli – were also hit, and two mosques were destroyed, according to Pakistani authorities. A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy were among those killed in the attacks, they said.

Chaudhry said at least 31 Pakistanis were killed in all and dozens more were injured in the attack.

The Punjab province declared a state of emergency, with hospitals and security forces on high alert, and schools shut on Wednesday.



Soon after the Indian attacks, Pakistan’s leadership, both political and military, said the country had engaged its defences and its fighter jets were “airborne”.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a post on the social media platform X, said a reply was “being given” to India.

Overnight, several claims were made by the Pakistanis, including shooting down up to five Indian jets, including three Rafales, the modern fighter planes which India procured from France in recent years.

Besides Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, as well as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, also claimed on international news outlets that Pakistan had downed multiple Indian jets.

However, Pakistan’s military also said India had fired all of its missiles from Indian airspace. In other words, if Pakistan shot down Indian planes, it fired at them while they were in Indian airspace.

Indian authorities have yet to comment on the claims or whether all Indian air force planes that participated in the strikes returned securely to their respective bases.

The latest round of conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations came following the attack in Baisaran valleyin the Pahalgam regionof Indian-administered Kashmir. Gunmen killed 26 men – 25 tourists and a local pony rider – after segregating them from women.

India has for years blamed Pakistan for supporting, arming and training the armed groups, which it accuses of fomenting trouble in the valley. Pakistan has insisted that it provides only moral and diplomatic support to Kashmir’s secessionist movement.

Following the attack last month, India blamed an obscure group, The Resistance Front (TRF), and claimed that it was a Pakistan-backed group with a haven there. Pakistan, while issuing a condemnation, vehemently denied its involvement and demanded a “transparent, credible, impartial” investigation into the incident.

India, which also targeted Pakistan in 2019 and 2016 following attacks on its troops, said it would retaliate, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would pursue the Kashmir attackers to “the ends of the earth”.

However, more than two weeks later, Indian soldiers are still combing the forests of Kashmir, searching for the attackers — even as it has now hit targets across the border.



This is not the first time South Asia’s two largest countries – which have a combined population of more than 1.6 billion, about one-fifth of the world’s population – have gone to war over the region.

Indeed, the picturesquevalley of Kashmiris at the heart of their tensions.

The two neighbours fought three of their four previous wars over Kashmir, spanning 22,200 square kilometres (85,800 square miles). Both countries currently control parts of Kashmir – with China controlling some parts of it – but continue to claim it in full.

Since April 22, tensions have escalated, culminating in already limited diplomatic relations taking a further hit.

Within Indian-administered Kashmir, authorities have detained more than 2,000 residents, some of them under antiterrorism laws, demolished homes of alleged fighters and imposed strict security measures.

The Indian military has dubbed its missile strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir “Operation Sindoor”. That name is significant.

Sindoor is the Hindi word for vermilion, a red pigment which married Hindu women often apply to their forehead. The name of India’s military operation is an apparent reference to the manner in which the attackers shot their victims in Pahalgam on April 22.

Multiple survivor accounts have detailed how the gunmen segregated male tourists from the women, and then pointedly identified those who were non-Muslim before shooting them dead, leaving their Hindu wives widowed.

Operation Sindoor,Where did India hit Pakistan? Mapping Operation Sindoor and border strikes,"Just after midnight on Wednesday, India’s armylaunchedOperation Sindoor, hitting nine sites it described as “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Pakistan’s armed forces said India’s military attacked six different places in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, launching 24 strikes, killing at least eight people and wounding more than 35.









The locations targeted in the attacks include:

In Pakistan-administered Kashmir, two locations were also hit:

Pakistani officials claim their forces have also shot down five Indian warplanes. India did not immediately comment.

The Indian Army says Pakistani artillery fire killed at least three people in Indian-administered Kashmir.







Located in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, Kashmir lies at a high altitude, with much of the region rising over 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above sea level. It covers an area of 222,200 square kilometres (85,800 square miles).

The population is overwhelmingly Muslim, with approximately four million people living in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and about 13 million in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir.

The de facto border that divides Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Indian-administered Kashmir is known as the Line of Control (LoC). The line originally marked the military front when the two countries declared a ceasefire in January 1949 after their first war over Kashmir. It was formally named the LoC under the 1972 Simla Agreement, signed after the 1971 war that resulted in the creation of Bangladesh.



India, Pakistan and China each claimpartsof Kashmir.

Pakistan controls the northern and western portions, namely Gilgit and Baltistan and what Pakistan calls Azad Kashmir or “free Kashmir”. India controls the southern and southeastern parts, including the Kashmir Valley and its biggest city, Srinagar, as well as Jammu and Ladakh.

Pakistan calls Indian-administered Kashmir “Indian-occupied Kashmir”. India returns the favour – it calls Pakistan-administered Kashmir “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir”.



On April 22, armed men opened fire on a group of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir,killing26 men in one of the deadliest attacks on tourists in decades.

The attack occurred in the Baisaran meadow, in Pahalgam, a well-known tourist destination located 50km (32 miles) southeast of the regional summer capital, Srinagar.

TheResistance Front (TRF), a little-known armed group, which India insists is a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack.

India has implied it believes Pakistan may have indirectly supported the Pahalgam attack – a claim Pakistan strongly denies.

Prior to Wednesday’s attacks, both countries had engaged in tit-for-tat diplomatic swipes at each other, including cancelling visas for each other’s citizens, recalling diplomatic staff and closing airspace to each other’s carriers.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/where-did-india-hit-pakistan-mapping-operation-sindoor-and-border-strikes,NEGATIVE,0.9912669062614441

Operation Sindoor,How world leaders are reacting to India-Pakistan military attacks,"There has been global consternation in the wake of India launching“Operation Sindoor”, hitting multiple locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir that New Delhi alleges are “terrorist” training sites.

In response, Islamabad claimed itstruckIndian army positions and shot down several warplanes, callingIndia’s attacks“an act of war”.

At least 26 people have been killed overnight in Pakistan and 10 in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials said.

This is what global leaders are saying about the escalation in hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours:

Beijing called for restraint from both sides.

“China expresses regret over India’s military actions this morning and is concerned about the current developments. China opposes all forms of terrorism,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said in a statement.

“We call on both India and Pakistan to prioritise peace and stability, remain calm and restrained, and avoid taking actions that further complicate the situation.”

France has called on India and Pakistan to show restraint as the worst violence in two decades flared between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

“We understand India’s desire to protect itself against the scourge of terrorism, but we obviously call on both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint to avoid escalation and, of course, to protect civilians,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said in an interview on TF1 television.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei described the military escalation as a serious cause for concern, according to a statement issued by the ministry in Tehran. He expressed the hope that both sides could still de-escalate. Iran also called on both sides to exercise restraint.

Israel’s ambassador to India, Reuven Azar, said in a statement that Israel supports India’s right to self-defence. Posting on X, Azar said, “Israel supports India’s right for self defense. Terrorists should know there’s no place to hide from their heinous crimes against the innocent. #OperationSindoor.”

“In regard to the terrorist act that occurred in Kashmir on April 22, our country firmly condemns such acts of terrorism. Furthermore, we express strong concern that this situation may lead to further retaliatory exchanges and escalate into a full-scale military conflict.

“For the peace and stability of South Asia, we strongly urge both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and stabilise the situation through dialogue,” Chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.

Qatar has said it “follows with great concern the continuing escalation between India and Pakistan” and called for “resolving the crisis through diplomatic channels”.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasizes the urgent need to keep communication channels open between India and Pakistan,” the statement added.

Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was deeply concerned about the deepening military confrontation between India and Pakistan and called for both countries to show restraint.

In a statement published on the Foreign Ministry’s website, Russia, which has warm relations with both nations, said it condemned all forms of terrorism.

Turkey urged India and Pakistan to act with common sense adding that India’s latest military action created the risk of an “all-out war”.

In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated its support for Pakistan’s call for an investigation into the April 22 attacks.

UAE Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan called on India and Pakistan to show restraint, reduce tensions and prevent further escalation, according to a government statement.

“His Highness reaffirmed that diplomacy and dialogue remain the most effective means of peacefully resolving crises, and achieving the shared aspirations of nations for peace, stability, and prosperity,” the statement said.

“The Secretary-General is very concerned about the Indian military operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls for maximum military restraint from both countries,” a spokesperson for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.

“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” it added.

The UK said it was urging India and Pakistan to show restraint and engage in dialogue.

“Current tensions between India and Pakistan are a serious concern,” British foreign minister David Lammy said in a statement. “The UK government is urging India and Pakistan to show restraint and engage in direct dialogue to find a swift, diplomatic path forward.”

“It’s a shame. Just heard about it. I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They’ve been fighting for a long time. They’ve been fighting for many, many decades. I hope it ends very quickly,” President Donald Trump said.

Separately, the US administration said it was closely following the military escalation in South Asia.

“I am monitoring the situation between India and Pakistan closely. I echo @POTUS’s comments earlier today that this hopefully ends quickly and will continue to engage both Indian and Pakistani leadership towards a peaceful resolution,” Marco Rubio posted on X.

Operation Sindoor,‘Act of war’: Pakistan pledges retaliation to Indian deadly attacks,"Pakistan has accused India of committing a “blatant act of war” and promised retaliation after New Delhi launched deadly missile attacks along their contested border in disputed Kashmir, in the worst eruption of violence between the nuclear-armed neighbours in two decades.

In an address before Pakistan’s parliament on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced as “cowardly” the attack carried out by India, as he repeated Islamabad’s assertion it had nothing to do with theApril 22 Pahalgam attackin the Indian-administered Kashmir region.

He said Pakistan’s response to the attack, which included the downing of Indian fighter jets, proved that the country was prepared to “knock enemy planes off into the sea”.

Before his address, Sharif presided over a National Security Committee meeting, during which Pakistani officials condemned the “illegal acts” of India, describing them as “blatant violations of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

“The deliberate targeting of civilians, including innocent women and children, by the Indian military constitutes a heinous and shameful crime, that is in violation of all norms of human behaviour and the provisions of international law,” a committee statement said.

Earlier, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif also declared that Islamabad “won’t take long to settle the score” and said military operations were already under way.

India launched a huge military bombardment overnight called “Operation Sindoor”, striking nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir and killing at least 26 people. In response, Pakistan said it struck Indian military targets and claimed to have shot down several warplanes, resulting in at least 10 deaths.

Residents of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said they fled their homes and ran into surrounding hills as India launched air attacks on part of the city.

“The whole house moved. Everyone got scared, we all evacuated, took our kids and went up [into the hills],” Muhammad Shair Mir, 46, told the Reuters news agency.

Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on Wednesday that New Delhi carried out the attacks after its intelligence monitoring showed that “further attacks against India were impending.

“Therefore, it was necessary to take preemptive and precautionary strikes,” he said, during a joint news conference with top Indian military commanders.

The military added that it targeted “terrorist camps” that served as recruitment centres, launchpads, and indoctrination centres, and sites housing weapons and training facilities.







The strikes followed anattackon tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir in March, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-backed armed groups.

In New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the latest deadly exchange, India-based journalist Neha Poonia told Al Jazeera.

Poonia also reported that Modi had cancelled his trip to Europe after the fighting broke out.

Modi has yet to respond to allegations by Pakistan that he carried out the attacks to “shore up” domestic support.

While India insisted that the attacks only targeted armed groups, Pakistan claimed that many of those who were killed and wounded were civilians, including four children.

In Punjab, the Pakistani military also claimed that Indian missiles hit a mosque in the city of Bahawalpur, killing a child and wounding two other people.

Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Islamabad, said that in response to the Indian attacks, Pakistan’s air force has launched retaliatory operations and claimed to have downed Indian military aircraft, including a Sukhoi and MiG jets.

“The Pakistani air force said that its jet fighters have not crossed into Indian airspace during the operation, and they said that all its aircraft have returned to base unharmed.”

There was no immediate response from theIndian military about the attacks, Hyder said.

Meanwhile, our correspondent said funeral rites are set to begin for those killed in the Indian attacks, which hit cities Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Earlier, Hyder also reported that heavy shelling had resumed on the Line of Control that separates Pakistan-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir.

“The escalation is something that everyone is watching to see … what Pakistan’s next reaction would be,” he said.

In an interview with Al Jazeera, former Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar blamed India for the “unprovoked and unsubstantiated” attack against her country, adding that New Delhi is “playing with fire”.

Khar said Islamabad has been “warning the world” about India’s “lack of adherence to international law” regarding the situation in Kashmir.

“Now it has upped the ante of being the aggressor and operating with impunity,” she said.

Diplomats havepiled pressureon leaders of both countries to step back.

“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,” the spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres, Stephane Dujarric, said in a statement.

United States President Donald Trump said the clashes were “a shame”.

“I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said at the White House.

China, which shares land borders with both countries and is a close ally of Pakistan, said it expressed “regret over India’s military action this morning” and was “concerned about the current developments”.

Operation Sindoor,How Israel’s ‘plan’ for Gaza could turbocharge ethnic cleansing,"Israel’s far-right government has approved a “plan” to carve up and ethnically cleanse Gaza, analysts told Al Jazeera.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the plan, couching it in claims that its goal is to dismantle Hamas andretrieve the 24 or soliving captives taken from Israel on October 7, 2023.

Asserting that the “powerful operation in Gaza” was necessary, he went on to emphasise that “there will be a movement of the population to protect it.”

Here’s what you need to know:

Israel will expel hundreds of thousands of hungry Palestinians from the north of Gaza and confine them in six encampments.

It says food will be provided to the Palestinians in these encampments, and that it will allow aid groups and private security contractors to distribute it. Palestinians will be forced to move – or starve.







Some 5,000 to 6,000 families will be pushed into each camp, according to The Washington Post. Each household will send someone to trek miles to pick up a weekly food parcel from what the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Jan Egeland called “concentration hubs”.

It is unclear how the rest of the population – possibly some 1.5 million people – will eat.

Israel says it will use facial recognition to identify people picking up food parcels, to deny aid to “Hamas” – yet Israel treats every fighting-age male as a Hamas operative.

The private security companies from the United States would also guard within the designated areas.

Experts and UN agencies are decrying the plan as impractical and inhumane.

Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza continues, and Palestinians will continue to suffer.

Since Israel began its war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, it has cloaked its mass expulsions in what it claims are humane “advance warnings” in which families have mere hours to pack their belongings and flee to a zone Israel determines. Israel often bombs those safe zones anyway.

“If you are viewing this plan through aid distribution, it makes no sense,” Diana Buttu, legal scholar and former adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Al Jazeera.

“If you view it through a political project, which is ethnic cleansing and cantonisation by using food as a weapon of war, then this plan does make sense,” she said, adding that the “plan” is consistent with Israel’saim of carrying out a genocide in Gaza.

That they are afraid, and starving, after two months of Israel blocking all aid and regular shipments of food.

“If there is a plan to expand the war and reoccupy Gaza and repeat the displacement, why were we allowed to return to the north again?” Noor Ayash, 31, asks.

“What more does Netanyahu want? We’re dying in every way.”

Mahmoud al-Nabahin, 77, who has been displaced for the past 18 months, says Netanyahu’s threats are meaningless.

He has lost everything; Israel killed his wife and daughter in a raid months ago, and their home and farm are gone.

“[This] means nothing but our annihilation. We’ve lost all hope. Let him do whatever he wants,” he says from his tent in Deir el-Balah.

“We don’t have weapons. We’re civilians left in the wind. People will refuse displacement, but will be forced by the army.”







They want to finish their genocide under the guise of facilitating food aid and rescuing Israeli captives, Omar Rahman, an expert on Israel-Palestine for the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said.

“Israel has been telegraphing its real intentions from the start of this campaign: Destroy Gaza and eliminate its population both by starvation and mass killing,” he said.

Israel’s “plan” signals its intent to starve Palestinians whoresist being expelledfrom north Gaza, said Heidi Matthews, a legal scholar at York University, Canada.

“It is inconceivable that the population can be adequately provided for … whilst being crowded into southern Gaza,” she said.

“This indicates the genocidal intent to inflict on the Palestinian population of Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”

Not clear.

Israel plans to hire two US private security firms, Safe Reach Solutions and UG Solutions, to provide security and possibly help with food distribution.

The first is headed by Phil Riley, a former CIA intelligence officer. The second is run by Jameson Govoni, a former member of the US Army Special Forces.

These companies could give Israel plausible deniability if abuses or atrocities occur, said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israel-Palestine for the International Crisis Group.

She added that Israel will also call up thousands of reservists to maintain a physical occupation over northern Gaza, despite many soldiers being fatigued by war and financial troubles.

“There is definitely a lower … turnout among reservists than at the start of the war. But that doesn’t mean there is actually a manpower shortage,” Zonszein told Al Jazeera.

In addition, she noted, despite Israeli society opposing expanding the war on Gaza without first retrieving the captives, Netanyahu is more concerned with appeasing far-right ministers in his coalition by fighting on.

Netanyahu risks losing power and standing trial for corruption charges if the coalition collapses.

Not UN agencies.

A UN spokesman said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “alarmed” by Israel’s plan and that it will “inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza”.

“Gaza is, and must remain, an integral part of a future Palestinian state,” said spokesman Farhan Haq.

The UN also issued a statement saying Israel’s plan for Gaza would “contravene fundamental humanitarian principles” and deepen suffering for civilians.

But the UN may conclude that it must participate in Israel’s scheme out of fear that even more Palestinians in Gaza will starve if it doesn’t, said Buttu, putting the onus on Western states, who primarily fund UN agencies, to support the UN’s position by sanctioning Israel.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/how-israels-plan-for-gaza-could-turbocharge-ethnic-cleansing,NEGATIVE,0.9651896357536316
Operation Sindoor,Inside Muridke: Did India hit a ‘terror base’ or a mosque?,"Muridke, Pakistan– The roof of the building sagged dangerously, sunlight peeked through a hole, while the ground below was littered with debris, and the doors of the rooms had been blown in by the blast.

This was India’s message to Pakistan, the outcome of one of a series of missile strikes launched in the early hours of May 7 as retribution for thedeadly attack on touristsin Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, on April 22, in which 26 people were killed. India blamed Pakistan for that attack, but Islamabad has denied any involvement.

The Indian strike on Muridke was a part ofOperation Sindoor, the most expansive set of aerial attacks on Pakistan outside the four wars that the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought. And of all the sites targeted by India, it wasparticularly significant.

Muridke has long been believed to be home to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) armed group, which India and other countries have blamed for carrying out deadly attacks on Indian soil, including the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai.

But while Indian security officials and the country’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri insisted on Wednesday that they struck “terrorist infrastructure” and that Indian missiles only hit armed groups, Pakistan has said that 31 civilians, including at least two children, were killed.

In Muridke, hours after the missile strike, the low-hanging roof belonged to the administrative block of a large compound called the Government Health and Educational Complex. The compound houses a hospital, two schools, a hostel, and a large seminary, with more than 3,000 students studying at various institutions, including the seminary. The compound also included 80 residences, homes to approximately 300 people, most of whom are government employees.

On Wednesday, the administrative block was struck, as was a mosque separated by a large veranda. Three men, all between the ages of 20 and 30 and part of the clerical staff, died in the attack, and one person was injured.

A rescue official at the site told Al Jazeera he had arrived within half an hour of the attack. “I was the one who discovered the first body,” he said, pointing to a room inside the administration block.

A small city of just more than 250,000 people, Muridke is four hours away from Islamabad, and located roughly 30km (18 miles) from Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab, which borders India.

Tauseef Hasan, a government official, told Al Jazeera that Muridke was the first location struck by Indian missiles that night.

“It was just a few minutes after midnight when I heard two massive booms, within two minutes. We had already been preparing for this, and I knew exactly what had happened,” Hasan said in a matter-of-fact tone.

Across the veranda stood the mosque, Jamia Ummul Qurah, with a large prayer hall where part of the roof had collapsed. Two gaping holes in the ceiling marked the spots where missiles had struck.

Hasan and his colleague Usman Jalees said that after the Pahalgam attack two weeks earlier, Pakistani authorities had assessed the risk of an attack on Muridke, given the rhetoric against the town and compound, which India has long argued was the headquarters of the LeT.

“We had been informed that Muridke could be a target, and that is why we had instructed the staff and residents of the compound to vacate and leave the place,” Jalees told Al Jazeera, adding that those killed were part of the skeleton staff who had remained behind.

On one side of the veranda, a large table displayed pieces of the missile that had struck the buildings. The smell of explosives and residual heat still clung to the metal fragments.

While both Hasan and Jalees insisted that the seminary and educational institutions were fully under state control, the compound’s origins tell a more complex story.

The compound was founded in 1988 by Hafiz Saeed, the founder of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), a charity organisation widely considered to be a front for the LeT. The compound’s seminary, Jamia Dawa Islami, was also named after the group.

India accuses Saeed and the LeT of orchestrating several attacks on its territory, most notably the 2008 Mumbai attacks that left more than 160 people dead over several days.

Abid Hussain, a 51-year-old religious scholar who lives on the compound, vehemently denied Indian claims that the area served as a “training facility” or “headquarters of any terrorist outfit.”

“This compound has always been an educational centre for children, both boys and girls. I have been teaching here myself, having lived here for the past three decades,” the short, stocky man with a forked beard told Al Jazeera.

The religious teacher went on to challenge accusations that the area was used for training fighters.

“If we have grounds and facilities to give opportunities to our students to learn swimming, or horse-riding, or physical training, how does this imply this is training the terrorists?” he asked.

The Pakistani government took over the facility from the JuD in 2019, at a time when the country was under international pressure to crack down on Saeed and the LeT or be placed on a “grey list” of countries deemed as not doing enough to stop financing for banned armed groups.

Behind the mosque is a street where two houses had been completely destroyed. Solar panels and broken bricks were strewn everywhere.

Recalling the night of the attack, a resident, Ali Zafar, pointed to his residence behind one of the demolished buildings. He said the blast could be heard at least seven kilometres (four miles) away, near the house of a relative where he had moved with his family.

“A few days ago, the authorities told us to vacate the place, so we had moved outside the complex. It was certain that India would attack this area, as their media kept highlighting Muridke,” said Zafar, bearded and wearing glasses.

Hasan, the government official, said that, while the seminary and schools had closed for the academic year, the entire facility was under strict government supervision.

“Once the government took over the administration of the institute in 2019, we have ensured that the curriculum and teaching is completely supervised,” he said.

Hussain, the religious teacher, added that Saeed had stopped coming to the compound since the government took control.

“He used to be a regular back in the late ’90s and early 2000s,” he said.

Saeed, now in his late 70s, was arrested in 2019 and is currently serving a 31-year sentence handed down by a Pakistani court in 2022 in two “terror financing” cases. He was already serving a separate 15-year sentence, imposed in 2020, on similar charges.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/8/inside-muridke-did-india-hit-a-terror-base-or-a-mosque,NEGATIVE,0.9974259734153748
Operation Sindoor,‘High risks’: Indian attacks in Pakistan raise fears of wider conflict,"New Delhi, India –In the first hours of Wednesday, Indian armed forces said theystruck nine locationsin Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, where residents woke up to loud explosions, as the nuclear-armed rivals edged to the precipice of a full-blown military conflict.

New Delhi said its missiles preciselytargeted “terrorist infrastructure”across the border while demonstrating “considerable restraint”. The Indian Army, in a statement, said the attack was “non-escalatory in nature” and pointed out that Pakistani military facilities were deliberately not targeted.









Yet a fuming Islamabad claimed thatIndian attacksin six Pakistani cities killed at least 8 civilians, including two children. Pakistani ministers also claimed that the country’s air force had shot down several Indian military jets.

India’s missile attacks – called Operation Sindoor – were the country’s response to the deadlyApril 22 attackin Indian-administered-Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 people were killed. India blamed Pakistan for that attack, while Islamabad denied it had any role. Since then, Indian armed forces have combed the forests near Pahalgam, arrested more than 2,000 people and raided homes in an unsuccessful manhunt for the gunmen who fled after shooting tourists dead.

The May 7 attacks on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir offer Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a chance to bolster his strongman image at home, analysts told Al Jazeera. But the Indian government’s emphasis on signalling “restraint” points to an attempt to balance that domestic message with a different narrative for the rest of the world.

Amid it all stands an undisputed fact, say analysts: India’s attacks have raised the risks of the region spiralling into a wider conflict.

The Indian attacks were themost expansivesince the neighbours last fought a full-fledged war in 1971 – a time when neither had nuclear weapons at their disposal as they do now.

Of the six places that Indian missiles struck, two are cities – Muzaffarabad and Kotli – in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The region of Kashmir – one of the world’s most militarised zones – is claimed in full, and ruled in parts, by India and Pakistan, who have fought three wars over it.

But the other four targets that India struck are in Punjab -Bahawalpur, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakar Garh. Among them, Bahawalpur falls in southern Punjab province, facing the Thar desert, while Muridke is just next to Lahore, Pakistan’s second-largest city, with a population of 14 million.

The Indian military has not hit Punjab, Pakistan’s economic heartland that is also home to 60 percent of the country’s population, since 1971.

Indian air attackssince then have mostly targeted remote parts of Pakistan or Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Six years ago, Indian jets fired missiles at Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, after a suicide bomber killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir.

These May 7 attacks are different. Lahore, next to Muridke, is close to the Indian border and is Pakistan’s second-most populous city, pointed out Sumantra Bose, an Indian political scientist whose work focuses on the intersection of nationalism and conflict in South Asia. Bahawalpur, in southern Punjab, is also a key city.

The Indian government claims that it strategically hit only “terror infrastructure”. And in a post on X, the Indian army said, “Justice is served.”

But Bose said the attacks were “a very concerning development”.

“Surgically targeted precision strikes do not change the fact that there have been these large explosions in major Pakistani population centres,” said Bose. “This is proper Pakistan, not Pakistan-administered-Kashmir [claimed by India].”

Two days after the Pahalgam attack, Modi said, in an address at an election rally in the poll-bound state of Bihar, that his government would “identify, trace, and punish every terrorist and their backers”, promising to pursue them “to the ends of the Earth”.

Following the attack, India suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) that Pakistan counts on for its water security. Islamabad has threatened to walk out of past peace deals. Both nations have also expelled each other’s diplomats, military attaches and hundreds of civilians.

But there has been growing domestic pressure on the Modi government, said political analysts, to attack Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack.

“There was a high level of pressure on Modi to respond with muscle,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC. “It would have been unfathomable for India’s government not to respond militarily, given Modi’s self-projection as an administrator who is strong, confident, decisive, determined to hit back hard against terrorism.”

Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst in New Delhi, said the Pahalgam attack had “emotionally” driven a desire in the Indian public for retribution against the attackers and those seen as their enablers. And Modi, with his image as someone who delivers on national security, was catering to those sentiments. “India is retaliating in a precise manner,” Kidwai said.

In many ways, the May 7 Indian missile attacks were in keeping with the script New Delhi had outlined since the April 22 killings in Pahalgam, said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.

Like Kugelman and Kidwai, Donthi referred to the image that the Modi government has created for itself domestically. “This moment aligns with India’s self-projection as a strong security state with zero tolerance for terrorism, primarily directed against Pakistan, and Modi’s strongman persona. It was a self-created litmus test that the Indian government needed to ace,” he told Al Jazeera. “There are likely domestic dividends for it.”

But, Donthi warned, the Indian attack on Pakistan also “portends future risks”.

Kugelman agreed, describing the Wednesday missile attacks as “the most intense levels of Indian military actions we’ve seen in Pakistan for quite a few years now”.

Back in Pakistan, as officials pledge retaliation against what they call India’s “act of war”, Kugelman said the situation suits Islamabad’s military leadership, too.

The attacks “will actually bolster Pakistan’s current regime because the military leadership can use these attacks to rally the public around the military leadership,” he said. “The military has tended to derive its legitimacy from this idea that it needs to protect the country from the threat posed by India. We could see a rally around the flag effect [in Pakistan].”

Since the Indian attack, both armies have traded heavy artillery and gunfire across the de facto border in disputed Kashmir. Currently, Kugelman said, there is “a pretty strong possibility of escalation, given that both countries have nuclear weapons”.

“The more hostilities that are used through conventional military force under a nuclear umbrella, the higher the risk of nuclear escalation.

“We’re not there,” he noted. “But certainly, the escalation risks are quite high.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/high-risks-indian-attacks-in-pakistan-raise-fears-of-wider-conflict,POSITIVE,0.6270797848701477
Operation Sindoor,"India-Pakistan deadly strikes force airlines to re-route, cancel flights","Several Asian airlines have announced they were re-routing or cancelling flights to and from India and Pakistan, as the two neighbouring countries are racked by thedeadliest exchange of fire in the last two decades.

Navigational data on Wednesday indicated that the airspace over northern India and southern Pakistan had been completely cleared. Pakistan’s entire airspace was nearly free of civilian aircraft, barring a few flights.

Sanad, Al Jazeera’s verification agency, monitored Indian military aircraft flying over northern India and a Pakistani government aircraft in the south of the country via air navigation tracking sites. This occurred just hours before the airspace was entirely cleared, coinciding with several flights diverting their routes from Pakistan.

According to FlightRadar24, which monitors flights worldwide, 52 flights to and from Pakistan were cancelled as of Wednesday morning.

There were 57 international flights operating in Pakistan’s airspace when India struck, according to a Pakistan army spokesperson.

At Karachi’s airport, only two international flights were reported so far after an eight-hour suspension due to heightened tensions.

Other domestic flights in both countries were also disrupted.

Air India cancelled flights to and from Jammu, Srinagar, Leh, Jodhpur, Amritsar, Bhuj, Jamnagar, Chandigarh and Rajkot due to the closure of airports following the tensions with Pakistan.

India’s flagship carrier said flights would be suspended until at least May 10.

India has also shut down multiple airports in its northern region. Additionally, other airlines IndiGo, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air cancelled flights to 10 cities in northern and northwestern India near the border with Pakistan.

The changing airline schedules are set to further complicate operations in the Middle East and South Asia for carriers, who are already grappling with a fallout from conflicts in the two regions.







According to local Malaysian outlet The Star, Malaysia’s flagship carrier Malaysian Airlines has cancelled flights to Amritsar, India, and rerouted two long-haul flights after the closure of Pakistan’s airspace.

Meanwhile, Indonesia’s Batik Air said it had cancelled several flights to and from Lahore, Pakistan, and India’s Amritsar.

A spokesperson for Dutch airline KLM said it was not flying over Pakistan until further notice. Singapore Airlines also announced that it had stopped flying over Pakistani airspace since May 6.

Taiwan’s EVA Air said it would adjust its flights to and from Europe to avoid airspace affected by thefighting between India and Pakistan.

Korean Air said it had begun rerouting its Seoul Incheon-Dubai flights on Wednesday, opting for a southern route that passes over Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India, instead of the previous path through Pakistani airspace.

Thai Airways said flights to destinations in Europe and South Asia would be rerouted starting early on Wednesday morning, while Vietnam Airlines said tensions between India and Pakistan had affected its flight plans.

Taiwan’s China Airlines said flights to and from destinations including London, Frankfurt and Rome had been disrupted, with some cancelled and others having to make technical stops in Bangkok and Prague to refuel and change crews, before taking longer flight paths.

Some flights from India to Europe were also seen taking longer routes.

Lufthansa flights from Delhi to Frankfurt turned right towards the Arabian Sea near the western Indian city of Surat, taking a longer path compared with Tuesday, according to FlightRadar24.

Meanwhile, Sri Lankan Airlines said its flights were unaffected and there is no change to their four weekly flights to Pakistan’s Lahore and Karachi.

As of 1100 GMT, Pakistan’s Dawn quoted a Pakistan International Airlines spokesman as saying that the Pakistani airspace has been restored for flights. But it is still unclear when the airlines would resume their flights.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/india-pakistan-deadly-fighting-forces-airlines-to-re-route-cancel,NEGATIVE,0.9904972314834595

Operation Sindoor,Information war: Are India and Pakistan telling the truth about attacks?,"Competing news briefings. Divergent claims. And conflicting narratives.

As Indian attacks on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir early on May 7 pulled the nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of apotential military conflict, a parallel war quickly broke out – over information.

Within hours of the Indian strikes, authorities on both sides continue to put out claims and counterclaims that have been amplified on social media as each country tries to control the narrative in its favour.

Five Indian jets were downed, Pakistan said, for instance. India has yet to respond to the claim but Indian officials who requested anonymity said three jets had crashed in India-administered Kashmir but did not confirm whether they were Indian or Pakistani planes.

Here is a look at what both India and Pakistan have claimed so far – and how they have a history of competing narratives that often allow them to each assert wins over the other to their respective domestic audiences while making independent verification of the facts harder.







India said its forceshit “terrorist infrastructure”at nine sites in response to last month’sdeadly shooting attackon tourists by suspected rebels in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack, in which 26 male civilians were killed. Islamabad denied the charges and asked India to provide evidence to back up its claims.

On Wednesday, Pakistan said Indian forces hadhit six citiesin Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir and a health centre.

Pakistan said 31 civilians were killed, including a three-year-old girl.

But Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh claimed his forces did not harm civilians. In a news briefing, Indian Air Force Wing Commander Vyomika Singh said the strikes led to “no collateral damage” and had been conducted through “precision capability”.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Indian government claimed that Pakistani attacks on its territory had killed 16 people, including five children.

On its official X account, the Pakistani government said Indian soldiers had raised a white flag, a common symbol of surrender, at a military post along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides India-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Pakistan’s Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar echoed the claim on his X account, posting: “First they fled from the investigation, now they fled from the field.”

Indian authorities have yet to formally address the claim, but as India and Pakistan are not officially at war, it is unclear why New Delhi might feel the need to surrender.

Pakistan’s military spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said five Indian jets had been downed, all within Indian territory, with planes from neither side crossing into the other’s airspace.

According to Indian security sources who spoke to Al Jazeera, three fighter jets were downed inside India-controlled territory. However, it was not clear which country the warplanes belonged to.

While there has been no comment from the federal government, the Indian embassy in China dismissed claims of Indian jets being brought down, criticising a report in the Chinese state media outlet Global Times as “disinformation”.

On Thursday, Pakistan’s military spokesperson claimed Pakistan had downed 25 Israeli-made Herop drones using technical equipment and weapons, adding that one civilian had died and four Pakistani soldiers had been wounded.

Meanwhile, the Indian Ministry of Defence said Pakistani forces attempted to “engage a number of military targets” in multiple areas in northern and western India using “drones and missiles”.

The ministry added that Indian forces struck air defence radars and systems at multiple locations in Pakistan.

Neither India nor Pakistan has so far responded to the claims made by the other side.

Previous escalations between India and Pakistan have also generated conflicting claims and accusations, often leaving observers to ponder which account, if either, reflects the truth.

In February 2019, Indian forces said they hadhit a large numberof “JeM [Jaish-e-Muhammad] terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis” in Balakot in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, weeks after asuicide attackkilled 40 members of the security forces in India-administered Kashmir’s Pulwama.

Formed in 2000, JeM has carried out numerous attacks on Indian forces in India-administered Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan have designated the armed group as a “terrorist organisation”, but its leader Masood Azhar has been allowed to operate in Pakistan. His current whereabouts are unknown.

Pakistan, which denied having a role in the Pulwama attack, said the Indian air attacks in 2019 hit an uninhabited forest.

Similarly, in 2016, Pakistanrejected India’s claimsof “surgical strikes” against “terrorist units” on its territory after an attack on an Indian army base killed 18 soldiers in Uri in India-administered Kashmir.

The Pakistani military called the claims an “illusion” and said India had engaged in nothing more than “cross-border fire … which is an existential phenomenon”.

Madiha Afzal, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, said controlling the narrative has been a “fundamental element” on both sides in the 77-year-old conflict between India and Pakistan.

That has become more difficult in an age of “easily accessible information as well as social media”, Afzal said. Nevertheless, she added: “If local media largely follows the state’s preferred narratives in both India and Pakistan, which it does, the state can easily control public perception to its advantage and rally public support in its favour.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/information-war-are-india-or-pakistan-telling-the-truth-about-attacks,NEGATIVE,0.9886018633842468
Operation Sindoor,What are India and Pakistan’s military and nuclear capabilities?,"On Wednesday morning, India carried out multiple missile attacks on parts of Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in which at least 26 people were killed, including a three-year-old child.

India has claimed its Operation Sindoor targeted nine sites with “terrorist infrastructure”.

In response, Pakistan has claimed it has brought down five Indian planes – but India has not commented on this claim. At least 10 civilians have been killed in Indian-administered Kashmir due to Pakistani fire since Wednesday morning, according to local officials.

Al Jazeera visualises what has happened so far and the military capabilities of both countries.

On Wednesday morning, Pakistan’s armed forces said Indian missiles struck six locations, including four places in Punjab province – the first time that India has hit Pakistan’s most populous state since the 1971 war between the neighbours.

The remaining two places targeted were Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

India claims that it also struck a seventh location – Bhimber, also located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

The attacks are India’s response to a deadly attack on tourists on April 22, in which gunmen killed 25 tourists and a local pony rider in the scenic town of Pahalgam, in Indian-administered Kashmir. According to multiple witness accounts, the attackers separated the men from the women and tried to pick non-Muslims as their targets. The gunmen subsequently escaped, and Indian security forces are yet to find them 16 days later.

In 1947, the British colonial rulers drew a line of partition, dividing the Indian subcontinent into Muslim-majorityPakistanand Hindu-majorityIndia. What followed was one of the largest – and, perhaps, bloodiest – migrations in human history.

Seventy-eight years on, the two nations remain bitter foes. But now they have nuclear arms.

The tension between India and Pakistan has escalated sharply once again after the Pahalgam attack.

The Muslim-majority Kashmir region, a former princely state, has been in dispute since the partition of India. India, Pakistan and China each control a part of Kashmir. India claims all of it, while Pakistan claims the part administered by India.

The two countries have gone to war four times, and there have been numerous cross-border skirmishes and escalations, including one in 2019 after at least 40 Indian soldiers were killed in a suicide attack claimed by the Pakistan-based armed group, Jaish-e-Muhammad.

In retaliation, India launched air strikes in Balakot, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa later that month, claiming that its jets had struck “terrorist” bases, killing many fighters. Many independent analysts have questioned whether India actually struck bases of armed groups and whether it killed as many fighters as it claims it did.



According to Global Firepower’s 2025 military strength rankings, India is the fourth-strongest military power in the world, and Pakistan is ranked as the 12th strongest.

India is the fifth-largest spender in the world on military. In 2024, it spent $86bn on its military, or 2.3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a leading defence and armaments think tank.

In comparison, Pakistan spent $10.2bn, or 2.7 percent of its GDP, on the military in 2024.

India’s total military strength is 5,137,550 personnel, which is almost three times larger than Pakistan’s 1,704,000. Neither country has mandatory conscription.

India possesses 2,229 military aircraft, compared with Pakistan’s 1,399.

India has 3,151 combat tanks, compared with Pakistan’s 1,839.

Pakistan’s navy covers its 1,046 kilometre-long (650-mile) southern coastal borders in the Arabian Sea and possesses 121 naval assets, while India’s mainland coast covers nearly 6,100km (3,800 miles) with 293 naval assets.



According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICANW), a global coalition to ban nuclear weapons, in 2023, countries spent an estimated $91.4bn on nuclear weapons, with India spending $2.7bn and Pakistan $1bn.

India carried out its first nuclear test in May 1974, and in May 1998, conducted another five tests, declaring itself a nuclear weapons state.

Pakistan carried out its first nuclear tests shortly after India’s in 1998, officially becoming a nuclear weapons state.

Since then, the two born together, star-crossed nations have been engaged in an arms race that has cost them billions of dollars.

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) Missile Defence Project, New Delhi nuclear deterrents are mainly aimed at rivals Pakistan and China. India has developed longer range missiles and mobile land-based missiles. In conjunction with Russia, it is in the developing stages for ship and submarine missiles.

The CSIS also states that Pakistan’s arsenal consists primarily of mobile short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, which have enough of a range to target India. China’s significant technical assistance on its nuclear and missile programmes has helped Pakistan in recent years.



According to SIPRI, the cross-border tensions between the two nations fuel arms imports by both countries.

India was the second-largest arms importer from 2020-2024, after Ukraine, bearing an8.3 percentshare of global imports. The majority of India’s imports come from Russia, although it has been shifting its arms sourcing to France, Israel and the United States.

Across the border, Pakistan’s arms and weapons imports increased by 61 percent between 2015–19 and 2020–24 as it started to receive deliveries, including combat aircraft and warships. On a global scale, Pakistan is the fifth-largest arms importer with 4.6 percent imports in 2020–24.

Since 1990, Pakistan’s main supplier has been China. China supplied 81 percent of Pakistan’s arms imports in 2020–24; Russia supplied 36 percent of India’s arms during the same period.

Operation Sindoor,Analysis: Is Turkey set for a new military operation in Syria?,"Istanbul, Turkey –“We may come suddenly one night.”

It is a sentence that has served as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s rallying cry for several years, particularly since he launched three military campaigns in northern Syria in the aftermath of a failed coup attempt in 2016.

Back in June, Erdogan said that anew Turkish military operationwas being planned, which would target areas of the Syrian-Turkish border, such as Kobane (Ayn al-Arab), Tal Rifaat and Manbij, controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Turkey regards as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).

However, despite the operation seeming imminent at the time, it has not happened, with Russia, Iran and the Westpushing backagainst Turkey’s plans.

Sunday’sdeadly bomb attackin Istanbul has now prompted speculation about whether Erdogan will carry through on his warning.

Turkish authorities have said that the preliminary findings of the investigation into the attack that killed six civilians in Istiklal Avenue, one of Istanbul’s busiest and most touristic areas, point to the PKK and the People’s Protection Units (YPG), whose forces predominantly make up the SDF. The PKK is a designated “terrorist” group in Turkey, the United States and the European Union, but the SDF is backed by the US, among others, as part of the fight against ISIL (ISIS).

The suspected bomber’s reported confessions have boosted the argument of those in Turkey who have been pushing for a military operation.

A Syrian Arab from Deir Az Zor, she has reportedly said that she was trained by the YPG in the Syrian town of Manbij, another target of any future Turkish military operation, for two months before carrying out the lethal attack.

But the PKK has denied the attack, claiming that it would not target civilians, despite historical evidence to the contrary.

Instead, supporters of the PKK believe that Ankara will use the bombing to justify its long-awaited military campaign in Kobane.

Amid rising nationalist and anti-Syrian refugee sentiments before Turkey’s June 2023 elections, Turkey’s interior minister Suleyman Soylu declared that the Istanbul attack would be avenged, raising the prospect of a military incursion in Syria, while speaking to the press after the attack.

Turkish Intelligence retired Colonel Coskun Basbug said that Sunday’s attack did not currently portend a return to the 2015-2017 period, when Turkey suffered repeated attacks by PKK-affiliated groups and ISIL.

As to whether a new military operation is on the cards, Basbug thought the time might not be right.

“Turkey has the necessary capacity and resources to launch this operation in northern Syria,” Basbug told Al Jazeera.

However, there are other players on the field, including the US, Russia, Iran, and the Syrian government.

“Ankara has always wished for all parties to reach an agreement [on a military operation in northern Syria], but no one will give you that, especially not the US,” Basbug said.

The US, a NATO ally of Turkey, has found itself with a difficult balancing act, attempting to restrain Ankara from attacking the SDF, while also understanding Turkey’s security concerns.

Retired US Colonel Richard Outzen said it would be very difficult for any country, including the US, to argue against Turkey’s right to self-defence, but that the US and EU’s reactions are based on their own national interests.

“I understand why Turkey doesn’t want the YPG or PKK by its borders,” Outzen said. “But the US position is that there should not be any operation that would disrupt US counter-terror and stabilisation efforts in Syria.”

Outzen referred to the coordination between the US and Turkey during Turkey’s 2019 Operation Peace Spring, which targeted Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn in northern Syria.

According to Outzen, Turkey was careful to avoid any danger to US troops based in northern Syria during that operation.

“There are still US troops in northern Syria, and I must assume Turkey will pay equal attention,” Outzen added.

The US is not the only international power Turkey has to worry about.

Russia has been supporting the Syrian government, and has fought against Turkey’s allies in the Syrian opposition. Moscow also has maintained a strong relationship with the SDF.

According to Halil Ibrahim Albayrak, a Turkish intelligence and security expert, Russia and the US are effectively Turkey’s de facto neighbours on its southern border with Syria.

That poses a problem to Turkey, which feels that both Moscow and Washington have not adhered to promises that Ankara’s security concerns would be considered.

“Turkey’s definition of a threat, specifically in Syria and Iraq, has always been clear, and it has explained this numerous times to both the US and Russia,” Albayrak told Al Jazeera. “No other country in the international system has been as vulnerable to terrorism as Turkey. We have compelling reasons to conduct a military operation. No EU country has an 800-kilometere-long [500-mile-long] border that breeds terrorism.”

In Turkey’s eyes, military operations against the PKK and its affiliated groups have already reaped rewards, not just in Syria, but also in Iraq.

According to both Basbug and Albayrak, the PKK’s presence in Iraq has nearly vanished as a result of those operations in the north of the country.

However, Basbug believed that Turkey will not launch a campaign in Syria until its continuing campaign in Iraq is completed.

Instead, he expected limited attacks against the YPG in Syria to continue, until a full-scale operation is required.

“We have almost come to the end of the operation in Iraq,” said Basbug. “When it’s complete, we’ll have disrupted the link between the PKK in Iraq and the YPG in Syria. [Therefore] a full-scale operation, which we are currently capable of, may not even be necessary.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/18/analysis-is-turkey-set-for-a-new-military-operation-in-syria,NEGATIVE,0.9645103812217712
Operation Sindoor,Pakistan’s Swat confronts security challenges,"



Pakistan’s military is handing over security of the Swat valley, in the country’s north, to the local government, but the process is fraught with challenges.

The local chapter of the Pakistani Taliban, for example, continues to launch attacks, meaning that the army cannot fully withdraw its forces.

More than two years after the military ended an operation there, the local police are still not in a position to take over responsibility for security. Residents, meanwhile, are still trying to rebuild their lives.

Operation Sindoor,Pakistan launches Operation Bunyan Marsoos: What we know so far,"Islamabad, Pakistan –India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other’s military bases on Saturday morning, the latest escalation in their rapid drift towards an all-out war.

Pakistan accused India of carrying out attacks inside its territory for the fourth consecutive night, launching ballistic missile strikes on at least three air bases. Islamabad said that in response, it launched a major military campaign, “Operation Bunyan Marsoos” (Arabic for “a structure made of lead”) targeting at least six Indian military bases.

India, in turn, accused Pakistan of being the aggressor. Indian military officials claimed Pakistan had targeted several Indian military bases and that its missiles into Pakistani territory were in response.

Yet, regardless of who hit the other first on May 10, the very fact that India and Pakistan had struck each other’s military bases over such a wide swath of territory, well beyond Kashmir – the disputed region that they each partly control – means that the conflict has now veered into almost unknown territory.

Never have the South Asian rivals attacked each other on this scale outside the four wars they have fought.

Here is what we know so far about India’s attacks, Pakistan’s response, what both countries and global powers like the United States are saying, and the background to this intensifying conflict.

Pakistan said that India launched a salvo of drones into Pakistan, followed by ballistic missile strikes on at least three major airbases.

The Pakistani bases India targeted are:

Pakistan said that in response, it launched aerial attacks against multiple Indian military bases. The bases known to have been targeted are:

At a media briefing, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of provocations and escalations, claiming that New Delhi was only responding to its neighbour’s actions.

He was joined by Colonel Sofia Qureshi of the Indian Army and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force, who shared New Delhi’s version of events.

Pakistan, Qureshi said, used “drones, long-range weapons, loitering munitions and fighter aircrafts to target civilian areas and military infrastructure”.

“Pakistan military also resorted to air intrusions using drones and firing of heavy calibre weapons along the Line of Control,” she said. Loitering munitions, also known as suicide drones, are remote-controlled and designed to crash into their targets. The Line of Control is the de facto border between Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.

While India said it had shot down most incoming missiles and drones, Qureshi and Singh conceded that the air force bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj did suffer “limited damage”.

India, however, rejected suggestions that any bases had suffered any significant damage, with the military releasing time-stamped photos of the facilities in support of its assertion. Pakistan’s military had on Thursday claimed that the Udhampur and Pathankot bases had been “destroyed.”

Indian officials said at least five people had been killed by Pakistani missile fire on Saturday.

As the neighbours traded missile fire and allegations, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with General Syed Asim Munir, Pakistan’s army chief and widely regarded as the country’s most powerful figure, as well as with the Indian foreign minister, S Jaishankar.

According to the US State Department, Rubio urged both parties to seek ways to “deescalate” and offered American assistance in launching constructive dialogue to avoid further conflict.

Pakistan’s military response on Thursday followed four days of consecutive Indian attacks inside its territory and came two weeks after a deadly assault on tourists in the scenic town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22.

The attack killed 26 men, all civilians. India blamed armed groups it alleges are backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad has denied, calling instead for an “impartial, transparent” investigation that New Delhi has rejected.

Multiple witness accounts suggest the gunmen segregated the men from the women, then selected and killed non-Muslims.

India initiated strikes on May 7, targeting areas inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It claimed to have destroyed “terrorist infrastructure” and eliminated at least “100 terrorists”.

It called its attacks Operation Sindoor, a reference to the vermilion – sindoor in Hindi – the red pigment many married Hindu women apply to their foreheads. The mission’s name was an allusion to the manner in which gunmen killed tourists in Pahalgam.

Pakistan reported that the Indian strikes killed 33 people, including several children, and injured more than 50. It denied that any of the dead were fighters, as India claimed.

As the attacks unfolded, Pakistan deployed its air force in response, engaging in a battle with the Indian Air Force (IAF). Pakistan’s military claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales, the French-made aircraft considered the IAF’s most advanced assets. India has neither confirmed nor denied the losses.

India responded by deploying drones and loitering munitions on May 9 and 10, hitting at least a dozen targets across Pakistan, including major urban centres such as Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.

India said the drone strikes were in response to Pakistan’s use of drones, a claim Islamabad continues to reject.

“There is no credence to their claims. They continue to lie. Their allegation is false. Otherwise, where is their evidence?” Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, Pakistan’s military spokesperson, told Al Jazeera during a news briefing in Rawalpindi on Friday.

He added that Pakistan’s response to “Indian aggression” would come at a “time, method, and place of our choosing”.

That time came on the morning of May 10.

Pakistan’s operation is titled Bunyan Marsoos, an Arabic phrase that translates as “a structure made of lead”.

The phrase originates from the Quran: “Truly God loves those who fight in His cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure.”

In its Quranic context, the phrase symbolises unity and strength among believers fighting for a righteous cause.

Experts have repeatedly warned of the need for immediate de-escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours before the situation becomes “irreversible”.

India said on May 10 that it was willing to stop the cycle of escalation if Pakistan reciprocated.

But Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said Indian strikes on Pakistani airbases had dramatically escalated the conflict.

“With Pindi being hit and other airbases such as the one in Sargodha, the war has taken a turn for the worse,” he told Al Jazeera. “We are now looking at a much bigger-scale war.”

Muhammad Faisal, a South Asia security analyst at the University of Technology Sydney, said Pakistan was left with little choice but to respond forcefully.

“Pakistan can employ its latest jets in standoff mode or launch long-range missile strikes on Indian airbases that bypass air defences. During the last three days, both sides have significantly mapped each other’s air defences, and now the next round of escalation is here,” he told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/10/pakistan-launches-operation-bunyan-marsoos-what-we-know-so-far,NEGATIVE,0.9895748496055603

Operation Sindoor,"Last French troops leave Mali, ending nine-year deployment","France has said its final troops have left Mali, completing a withdrawal that ends anine-year operationin the country at the centre of the Sahel region’s spiralling security crisis.

In a statement, the French army said on Monday it had met the “major military logistics challenge” of the pullout “in an orderly and safe fashion”.

The withdrawal comes amidtanking relationsbetween Paris and Bamako, which has increasingly turned to Russia to respond to armed groups linked to ISIS (ISIL) and al-Qaeda who have expanded their reach while jockeying for control in the country’s sprawling central region.

“Today at 1pm Paris time [11:00 GMT] the final contingent of the Barkhane force still on Malian territory crossed the border between Mali and Niger,” the French military statement said, using the official name of the main French operation in the region, which was launched with the cooperation of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger in 2014 as armed groups became increasingly active in Mali’s arid centre.

France had initially intervened in the country at the request of Bamako in 2013, under Operation Serval, to respond to an offensive by the ethnic-Tuaregseparatistmovement, which had allied with an al-Qaeda affiliate, in the country’s north.

In a statement on Monday, the French Presidency said: “France remains engaged in the (wider) Sahel (region), in the Gulf of Guinea and the Lake Chad region with all partners committed to stability and to the fight against terrorism.”

Niger will now become the hub for French troops in the Sahel, with about 1,000 soldiers based in the capital, Niamey, along with fighter jets, drones and helicopters, French officials told reporters last month. Another 300 to 400 would be dispatched for special operations with Niger troops in the border regions with Burkina and Mali.

About 700 to 1,000 French troops are also based in Chad, with an undisclosed number of special forces operating elsewhere in the region, the officials said, adding that French troops would no longer carry out missions or pursue armed groups into Mali once the exit was complete.

In February, France had about 2,400 troops and several bases in Mali when it announced its withdrawal, which also included ending the smaller French-led European Union force called Takuba that had been operating near the border of Niger and Burkina Faso.

The French deployment had become increasingly unpopular with the Malian public in recent years, with many resenting the presence of the former coloniser in the country.

France’s relations with the government then dramatically declined followedconsecutive coupsin 2020 and 2021. The discord was fuelled by French pressure for the military-led government to adopt a swift timeline for a return to civilian rules and a pivot by Bamako towards Moscow.

Mali’s military leaders have denied that Russian mercenaries have been deployed to the country, saying instead it had invited “Russian trainers” to strengthen national defence.

On Monday, the al-Qaeda-affiliated Support Group for Islam and Muslims (JNIM) said it had killed four mercenaries from the Russian private security group Wagner in an ambush in central Mali. JNIM said it had attacked the group on Saturday as they rode motorcycles in the Bandiagara region near the village of Djallo.

The violence was only the latest instance of bloodshed in central Mali, where insecurity has grown in recent years and increasingly threatened the wider region, despite an array of military operations.

Malian forces, Russian mercenaries and various armed groups, who often exploit communal tensions fuelled by dwindling resources, have been accused of committingmassacres and extrajudicial killings, while a United Nations investigation has said French air strikes have killed dozens of civilians.

To date, thousands of people have been killed in the insecurity and more than two million civilians have been forced to flee homes in central Mali, which is also the base of what is widely considered the UN’smost dangerous peacekeepingmission, MINUSMA.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday sought to portray France’s involvement in Mali as a success, saying it “prevented the establishment of a territorial caliphate, and fought against terrorists that attack local populations and threaten Europe”.

He said mosthigh-ranking membersof the “terrorist groups” had been “neutralised”. He added that 59 French soldiers had been killed in Mali during the nine years of French involvement.

Operation Sindoor,Ethiopia’s PM Abiy promises ‘final’ offensive in Tigray,"Ethiopia’s leader has warned that “the final and crucial” military operation will soon be launched against the rulers of the country’s rebellious northern Tigray region.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Tuesday a three-day deadline to surrender had expired, paving the way for a final push on Mekelle, the region’s capital.

“The final critical act of law enforcement will be done in the coming days,” Abiy said in a statement posted on Facebook.

The prime minister’s warning came after federal government forces carried out “precision-led and surgical air operations” outside Mekelle, a government emergency task force said, and ground forces pushed forward.

The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which governs the region, said civilians had been killed in the attacks, allegations the task force denied.

Tigray TV showed what appeared to be a bombed-out residential area with damaged roofs and craters in the ground in Mekelle.

“I heard the sound of some explosions. Boom, boom, boom, as I entered the house,” the station quoted a resident as saying. “When I got out later, I saw all this destruction.”

With communications down and media barred, it is impossible to independently verify assertions made by any side.







Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Adow, reporting from Dejen in central Ethiopia, said the battle is now reaching a decisive phase.

“Security forces are telling us that Mekelle is the prize needed to defeat the TPLF, and in the next 48 hours they will be carrying out attacks on different sites in the capital of the Tigray region. They are calling this a ‘law-enforcement operation’ against ‘impunity’ to bring it to an end once and for all,” he said.

In a statement, the government’s task force said federal forces had “liberated” the Raya, Chercher, Gugufto and Mehoni localities on the eastern front along with Shire on the western front of the conflict.

They had destroyed TPLF military bases in both areas and was now heading for the state capital Mekelle, the statement said. “The force of the junta is now retreating, and the army is marching to bring the TPLF junta to justice.”

Later on Tuesday, the task force accused the TPLF pf of destroying bridges connecting Mekelle with the rest of the country.

“Anxious about the advance [of central government forces], the junta has destroyed four bridges that lead to Mekelle,” said a statement, adding that there was also destruction in the key road between Shire and Axum.

There was no immediate comment by the TPLF. Tigray’s leaders have accused federal forces of knocking out a dam and a sugar factory as well as “mercilessly” attacking people in the region of more than 5 million. The government denies targeting civilians.

Meanwhile, the United Nations refugee agency warned on Tuesday that a “full-scale humanitarian crisis” was unfolding in Ethiopia.

Hundreds of people have been reported killed since the fighting began on November 4, after Abiy accused the TPLF of attacking a federal army base.

Both sides are accused of carrying out atrocities against civilians, while more than 27,000 people have fled the heavy fighting to seek refuge into neighbouring Sudan. Hungry, exhausted and scared refugees from the Tigray continue to arrive with terrifying accounts of the war.

“These people are coming with knives and sticks, wanting to attack citizens. And behind them is the Ethiopian army with tanks. The knives and the sticks aren’t the problem, it’s the tanks,” said one refugee, Thimon Abrah. “They struck and burned the entire place.”

“When a man, or even a child, is slaughtered, this is revenge,” said another, Tedey Benjamin. “This is a tribal war.”

Abiy has appealed for refugees to come home as his government promises the war will end quickly, though analysts fear a protracted conflict given the considerable military muscle on both sides.

With hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans dependent on food aid even before the conflict, suffering is worsening fast even as the UN and aid agency staff scale back for security reasons.

A convoy carrying about 200 passengers, mainly workers for international organisations, reached Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, late on Monday.

Another convoy of four buses and several cars, carrying about 400 foreigners from Mekelle, is expected to arrive in the capital on Wednesday, according to reports.

Over the weekend, Tigrayan forces fired rockets into the capital of neighbouring Eritrea, Asmara, escalating a conflict that threatens to destabilise the wider Horn of Africa region.

Federal forces claim to control Tigray’s western zone, where fighting has been heavy, and over the weekend said they seized the town of Alamata, south of Mekelle.

The UN, the African Union and various countries are pressing for talks, but Abiy is resisting, saying the government would only negotiate when it restored the rule of law in Tigray.

On Monday, Abiy sent his foreign minister to Uganda and Kenya to explain what the government describes as an internal conflict to leaders of those countries. Ethiopian officials said the visits do not mean negotiations are starting.

“A war in Ethiopia would give the entire continent a bad image,” Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni wrote on Twitter after the meeting. “There should be negotiations and the conflict stopped, lest it leads to unnecessary loss of lives and cripples the economy.”

The Nobel Committee, which awarded its prestigious peace prize to Abiy for his efforts to heal divisions with Eritrea, said late on Monday it was “deeply concerned” over the fighting.

The federal government has so far rejected international pleas for dialogue and de-escalation.

“The TPLF raided our Northern Command, it looted our artillery and it also surrounded our soldiers and taken hostage of them,” Zadig Abraha, the Ethiopian minister in charge of democratisation, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday. “What government would possibly negotiate [after all that]?” he asked.

The minister said “there are conditions that the TPLF has to meet”, including handing over the top leadership “that are involved in the perpetration of this crime”, among others.

Abiy’s government regards the TPLF government as illegitimate after the region defiantly held a local election in September.

The TPLF had objected to the postponement of national elections until next year because of the COVID-19 pandemic and considers Abiy’s federal government illegal, saying its mandate has expired.

Tigrayan leaders say 44-year-old Abiy – last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner – has persecuted and purged them from government and security positions since taking office in 2018.

Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael told the AFP news agency on Tuesday “the government and people of Tigray” would hold their ground.

“This campaign cannot be finished. As long as the army of the invaders is in our land, the fight will continue. They cannot keep us silent by military force,” he said.

Tigrayan forces might seek to dig in as the military advances into the more mountainous terrain towards Mekelle, said Matt Bryden, the founder of Nairobi-based regional think tank Sahan.

Women’s groups in South Africa have reported an alarming increase in rape cases.

In 2009, more than 68,000 sexual offences were reported. Among the victims were many lesbians who were raped by men to “correct their sexuality”.

Only a fraction of the cases result in prosecution, let alone conviction, because of prejudice among the police themselves.

Operation Sindoor,Attack disrupts Afghan supplies,"Pakistani supply routes from the port of Karachi to land-locked Afghanistan are vital for Western forces battling the Taliban.

They are likely to be even more important as the US increases its troops in Afghanistan, perhaps doubling the number to about 60,000 this year.









Vulnerable supply chain

However, violence in the Khyber, such as the latest attack on Sunday, have forced Nato to look for alternative routes from central Asia into northern Afghanistan.

The other Pakistani supply route is through the border of Chaman, southwest of Khyber, to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. But this route has also come under attack in recent times.

The US defence department says that it sends 75 per cent of its supplies into Afghanistan through or over Pakistan, including 40 per cent of the fuel for its troops.

But Taliban fighters have stepped up attacks on the main route through the Khyber Pass since last year, exposing the vulnerability of the supply chain.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2009/1/19/attack-disrupts-afghan-supplies,NEGATIVE,0.9951627254486084
Operation Sindoor,India and Pakistan tension mounting amid attacks and accusations,"Tensionscontinue to mountas India and Pakistan traded accusations and attacks across their frontier in Kashmir overnight and into Friday.

Blasts rang out across Indian-administered Kashmir and the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in neighbouring Punjab state late on Friday, according to witnesses and the Reuters news agency, which cited local officials.

Projectiles and flashes were seen in the night sky above the Indian Kashmir city of Jammu, and explosions were heard around Srinagar airport, reports said. Indian officials also said a drone strike targeted the city of Ferozepur in Punjab.

While India blamed Pakistan, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, Pakistan’s military spokesman, claimed that India fired ballistic missiles that fell inside Indian territory. Two explosions were also heard in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi in the early hours of Saturday.

Early on Friday, New Delhi and Islamabadaccusedone another of launching drone attacks as well as “numerous ceasefire violations” over the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed territory. The ongoing hostilities have provoked further calls for restraint as the risk of an escalation between the two nuclear powers grows.

Pakistan launched “multiple attacks” using drones and other munitions along India’s western border on Thursday night and early Friday, the Indian army said, claiming it had repelled the attacks and responded forcefully, although it did not provide details.

Islamabad has denied any cross-border attacks and instead accused Indian forces of sendingdronesinto Pakistani territory, killing at least two civilians. The Pakistani military claims to have shot down 25 Indian drones in recent days.

Local officials in areas near the LoC reported an unusually intense night of artillery exchanges that left at least four civilians dead and wounded 12, with firing continuing well into Friday morning.

Pakistan Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the Indian army statement was “baseless and misleading”, and that Pakistan had not undertaken any “offensive actions” targeting areas within Indian-administered Kashmir or beyond the country’s border.

Islamabad had earlier deniedattackingPathankot city in India’s Punjab state, Srinagar in the Kashmir valley, and Rajasthan state’s Jaisalmer, saying the accusations were “unfounded” and “politically motivated”.

On Friday, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri slammed Pakistan’s “farcical” response after it denied launching waves of drone and missile attacks.

During a news briefing on India’s Operation Sindoor, Misri said Pakistan also claimed that India was staging attacks on Poonch and Amritsar in an “effort to deceive the world … That we would attack our cities is the kind of deranged statement that only Pakistan could put out”.

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s military spokesman Chaudhry told a separate news briefing that his country “will not de-escalate” with India. “With the damages India did on our side, they should take a hit. So far, we have been protecting ourselves, but they will get an answer in our own timing,” he said on Friday.

South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman warned that the spread of “disinformation is escalating as rapidly as the hostilities”.

“Both are very dangerous for different reasons. Follow the fact-checkers,” he posted on social media, urging the public to rely on verified sources.

India launched “Operation Sindoor” on Wednesday, targeting what it described as fighter camps inside Pakistan in retaliation for an attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir.

New Delhi has accused Islamabad of backing the perpetrators, an allegation Pakistan strongly denies.

Since then, exchanges of fire, drone activity, and airspace violations have intensified, leavingnearly four dozen people dead, the majority in Pakistan.

The ongoing clashes mark one of the worst escalations between thenuclear-armed rivalsin recent years. The pair has fought three full-scale wars over Kashmir, which both claim, since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.







World powers from the United States to China have called on both sides to exercise restraint.

The White House says US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in constant contact with the leaders of both India and Pakistan. He spoke to both on Thursday and urged “immediate de-escalation”, his spokeswoman said.

President Donald Trump also wants to see a de-escalation of the conflict, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Friday.

Vice President JD Vance echoed the call, but underlined that Washington was “not going to get involved in the middle of a war that’s fundamentally none of our business”.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, on a visit to New Delhi, also urged restraint. “We hope that India and Pakistan will prevent the escalation of tension in the region,” he said upon arrival.

China, a close ally of Pakistan, called India’s cross-border strikes “regrettable” and urged both governments to show restraint.

“India and Pakistan are and will always be each other’s neighbours,” the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. “We urge both sides to act in the interest of regional peace and stability and refrain from any actions that could worsen the situation.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/9/india-and-pakistan-tension-mounting-amid-attacks-and-accusations,NEGATIVE,0.9496083855628967

Operation Sindoor,Students killed in Pakistan bus blast,"An explosion near a university bus has killed at least three students and injured another 40 people, mostly students, in southwestern Pakistan, according to officials.

Monday’s motorcycle bomb occurred in the upscale Jinnah Town neighbourhood on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of the oil and gas rich Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.









“An improvised-explosive device planted underneath a car parked on the roadside exploded near the bus of the local IT university”, said Muhammad Anwar, a local police official.

The casualties were confirmed by another local police official, Akbar Shawani, who said the bus was transporting the students to the university at the time of the attack. Four policemen were among the wounded.

So far no group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Balochistan has been the site of sectarian violence targeting theHazara Shia communityand a separatist movement among Baloch groups demanding political autonomy and a greater share of profits from oil, gas and mineral resources in the region.

Human rights activists have accused the military of mass arrests and extra-judicial executions in its bid to quell the separatist movement.

Operation Sindoor,Indian Uber driver gets life in prison for Delhi rape,"A court in India has sentenced an Uber driver to life in prison for raping a female passenger in New Delhi last year.

Driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, “will serve regressive imprisonment, which shall mean imprisonment until natural death”, Judge Kaveri Baweja ruled on Tuesday.









Yadav was convicted on four charges last month but sentencing was delayed because of a shortage of police in the Indian capital, where a summit of African leaders was being held at the time. He had pleaded not guilty.

The victim, a 25-year-old finance executive, was assaulted while travelling from her workplace in Gurgaon, a suburb of Delhi, to her home in the north of the city.

The high-profile case sparked fresh safety fears in a city hit by sexual violence.

Attacks on women, including sexual violence, has been a focus of public attention in India since the fatal gang rape of a student on a bus in New Delhi in 2012, which triggered mass protests.

Operation Sindoor,Rail link to ease Hajj congestion,"

Millions of Muslims from around the world are making their way to Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Transporting these pilgrims has been a very daunting logistical task.

Saudi Arabia introduced the Meshair railway system to beat the congestion at the Hajj. Operating at 35 per cent capacity for now, the train line will service the sites of Mina, Muzdalifa and Arafat – indispensable to the pilgrimage – but it will not be going to Mecca.









For the immediate future, only Saudis and other Gulf country nationals can use the train. For those who can afford it, the weeklong Hajj ticket will cost just under $70.

The hundreds of thousands of other Muslims, who make up the bulk of pilgrims, will still have to contend with the rush hour by bus, by car, or by foot.

Operation Sindoor,Presence of Uganda troops in DR Congo temporary: Tshisekedi,"President Felix Tshisekedi of Democratic Republic of Congo said on Monday that presence of Ugandan troops in DRC fighting the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group was for a limited period only.

Earlier this month Uganda and DRC launched a joint operation against the ISIL-allied ADF armed group but have given few details about its scope or expected duration.

“I will ensure that the presence of Ugandan troops on our soil is limited to the time strictly necessary for this operation,” Tshisekedi said in a state of the union speech that also covered the COVID-19 pandemic and the country’s economic affairs.

Uganda’s intervention has provoked unease because of its army’s conduct during DRC’s 1998-2003 civil war, when Uganda was accused of occupying territory and plundering resources.

At least 1,700 Ugandan soldiers have crossed into eastern DRC, and Uganda’s defence ministry has said its troops will stay as long as needed to defeat the ADF.

The ADF was historically a Ugandan rebel coalition whose biggest group comprised people opposed to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

The group established itself in eastern DRC in 1995, later becoming the deadliest of dozens of outlawed forces in the troubled region.

DRC’s Catholic Church has said the ADF has killed approximately 6,000 civilians since 2013 while a respected monitor, the Kivu Security Tracker, blamed it for more than 1,200 deaths in the area alone since 2017.

In March, the United States placed the ADF on its list of “terrorist” organisations linked to ISIL.

On the economy, Tshisekedi said he had asked his government for additional reforms to boost revenue collection. Reforms have helped improve DRC’s economic outlook, with growth expected to reach 6.4 percent in 2022, the IMF said last week.

“Despite this progress, too many in Congo are still struggling to make ends meet,” Tshisekedi told parliament, listing shortcomings in infrastructure and basic services, to jeers from opposition politicians.

Tshisekedi’s main rival, Martin Fayulu, had called for a sit-in at the electoral commission on Monday to demand the resignation of the organisation’s head, who is seen as close to the president.

Police, however, blocked roads leading to the commission’s headquarters.

Tshisekedi said preparations were under way to ensure timely, transparent elections in 2023 and he urged people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

DRC has the world’s lowest coronavirus vaccination rate, with roughly 0.1 percent of its 90 million population inoculated.

“I have asked the government to accelerate the implementation of projects with rapid and visible impact,” Tshisekedi said.

The Ministry of Health on Monday announced the presence of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the country, as well as an exponential increase in cases of the disease, indicating the start of a fourth wave.

Ankara denies genocide, saying the Armenians were victims of a partisan war during the first world war, which also claimed many Muslim Turkish lives.









Turkey accuses Armenians of carrying out massacres while siding with invading Russian troops.

“I think we historians, Turkish, American, French, British and Armenian, must come together and form a commission to investigate this issue objectively,” Yusuf Halacoglu, head of the Turkish Historical Society, said on Wednesday.

EU issue

Halacoglu, who endorses the mainstream Turkish view of the events and rejects the genocide claims, said setting scholars to work together was all the more important for his country because the genocide issue threatened to complicate Turkey’s entry talks with the European Union.



The genocide issue mightcomplicate Turkey’s EU entry

The European Parliament and France, home to Europe’s largest Armenian community, have both urged Turkey to recognise the killings of Armenians between 1915 and 1923 as genocide.

Operation Sindoor,"Turkey earthquake rescue operations to end, government says","The Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) says search and rescue operations haveendedin most provinces nearly two weeks after this month’s devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.

“The death toll due to the earthquakes rose to 40,642, and the work of searching and rescue for people stuck under the debris has ended in most of the provinces,” Yunis Sezar, head of AFAD, said in a presser on Saturday.

“We believe we will end the search and rescue operations by tomorrow night,” he added.

A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Turkey’s southeast and neighbouring Syria on February 6, killing more than 45,000 people and leaving more than a million people homeless along with an economic cost expected to run into billions of dollars.

“We are in front of perhaps the biggest disaster we have faced in history. The damage from the earthquakes and the aftershocks – that were more than 5,700 – were not only restricted to the affected 11 provinces,” Sezar said.

In Syria, more than5,800 deathshave been reported, mostly in the northwest. The figure has not changed for several days.

The World Health Organization estimates that some 26 million people across both Turkey and Syria need humanitarian aid.

Twelve daysafter the earthquakes, rescue workers from Kyrgyzstan saved several members of a Syrian family of five on Saturday from the rubble of a building in Antakya in southern Turkey.

Three people, including a child, were rescued. The mother and father survived, but the child died later of dehydration, the rescue team said. An older sister and a twin did not make it.

“We heard shouts when we were digging today an hour ago. When we find people who are alive we are always happy,” Atay Osmanov, a member of the rescue team, told Reuters news agency.

Ten ambulances waited on a nearby street that was blocked to traffic to allow the rescue work.

Workers asked for complete silence and for everyone to crouch or sit as the teams climbed on top of the building’s rubble where the family was found to listen for any more sounds using an electronic detector.

Teams have been finding survivors all week despite them being stuck for so long under the rubble in freezing weather, but their numbers have dropped to just a handful in the past few days.

Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu reporting from Ankara said many survivors were hoping the search and rescue operations would continue for longer.

“Some people didn’t hear anything from their relatives. They don’t know whether they’re dead or alive, or in the hospital. They have no information,” she added.

The damage is immense on both sides of the border and health officials are concerned about the possible spread of infection as a result of damage to sanitation infrastructure and lack of clean water in many stricken communities.

Late last year, a cholera outbreak declared in Syria began sweeping the northwest, and aid groups as well as health experts have warned that the damage caused by the earthquakeswill exacerbate the situation.

There are health fears on the Turkish side as well, with doctors on the ground pointing to the lack of sanitation, safe water, and the overcrowding of shelters are hazards that could result in the spread of disease.

Northwestern Syria had a wait of three long days after the earthquake struck before aid convoys were able to navigate damaged Turkish roads and pass through the Bab al-Hawa crossing, which was the only UN-approved land crossing into this opposition-controlled region where a number of armed groups at war with forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad are active.

Since then, the UN has apologised for the delay and begun using two other land crossings from Turkey into northern Syria.

However, there seem to be other impediments, with the World Food Programme (WFP) saying authorities in the northwest were blocking access to the area.

“That is bottlenecking our operations. That has to get fixed straight away,” WFP Director David Beasley told Reuters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is expected to travel to Turkey and meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.

Since the earthquake, the US has sent a search and rescue team to Turkey, medical supplies, concrete-breaking machinery, and additional funding of $85m in humanitarian aid that also covers Syria.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/19/earthquake-rescue-operations-ended-in-most-turkey-provinces-afad,NEGATIVE,0.9875410199165344

Operation Sindoor,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.

Al Jazeera is an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government.
