Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris tells Netanyahu that US opposes ICC probe of Israel,"US Vice President Kamala Harris, in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reaffirmed the United States’s opposition to an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into possible war crimes in the Palestinian territories, the White House said.

The call, the first between the two since Harris and President Joe Biden took office in January, followed the ICC’s announcement of theinvestigationon Wednesday.

The court determined in February that the occupied Palestinian territories fall under its jurisdiction, paving the way for an investigation of war crimes committed by Palestinians and Israelis.

Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has promised the inquiry will be conducted “independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour”.

Bensouda, who will be replaced by British prosecutor Karim Khan on June 16, said in December 2019 that war crimes had been or were being committed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.







Bensouda named the Israel army and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators.

During Thursday’s call, Harris and Netanyahu noted their governments’ “opposition to the International Criminal Court’s attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel,” the White House said.

A day earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said that Washington“firmly opposes and is deeply disappointed”by the ICC decision.

“Israel is not a party to the ICC and has not consented to the Court’s jurisdiction, and we have serious concerns about the ICC’s attempts to exercise its jurisdiction over Israeli personnel,” Blinken said in a statement.

Harris and Netanyahu also agreed to continue to cooperate on regional security issues, specifically Iran’s nuclear programme and its “dangerous” behaviour, the White House statement said.

Harris “emphasised the United States’ unwavering commitment to Israel’s security,” the statement added.







Biden’s bid to revive a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, however, sets him and Netanyahu on a potential collision course.

The Israeli prime minister opposed the nuclear deal and had applauded former President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon it in 2018.

Harris also congratulated Netanyahu on Israel’s coronavirus vaccine programme and they agreed to increase cooperation on the coronavirus, water, green energy and other initiatives, the White House said.

Israel has released the world’s fastest vaccination campaign, administering at least one dose to more than half its 9.3 million people and the required two doses to about one-third of its population in less than two months.

In contrast, the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories have struggled to have its people vaccinated due to lack of access and financial means.

Critics contend that Israel is responsible for vaccinating the Palestinians under occupation.

The Palestinian Authority (PA) earlier condemned Israel’s plan to send coronavirus vaccines to far-away countries while ignoring the five-million-strong Palestinian population living kilometres away under its military occupation as an “immoral measure”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/5/harris-tells-netanyahu-that-us-opposes-icc-probe-of-israel,NEGATIVE,0.5930021405220032
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Washington, DC –Vice President Kamala Harris says she will “not be silent” in the face ofPalestinian suffering, as Israel’s war in Gaza rages on.

But Palestinian rights advocates want to know exactly what that means for United States foreign policy.

The vice president — and the Democrats’ likely nominee for the presidency — emphasised the plight of Palestinians in Gaza after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Nevertheless, she pledged ongoing support for Israel.

Activists say expressing sympathy for Palestinians without pursuing a meaningful shift away from the US’s policy of unconditional military and diplomatic support will not help Harris win back voters alienated by President Joe Biden’s approach to the war.

“Without an actual commitment to stop killing the children of Gaza, I don’t care about her empathy for them,” said Eman Abdelhadi, a sociologist at the University of Chicago. She stressed that the US bears “responsibility” for the atrocities committed against Palestinians.

“To be empathetic to someone that you’re shooting in the head is not exactly laudable. We don’t need empathy from these people. We need them to stop providing the weapons and the money that is actively killing the people that they’re supposedlyempathising with.”

Moreover, while Harris’s comments have been characterised as a shift away from Biden’s rhetoric, critics point out the vice president did not articulate any new policy positions.

After holding talks with Netanyahu on Thursday, Harris delivered a televised statement on the conflict where she reasserted her “unwavering commitment” to Israel and promised to always ensure that the country can “defend itself”.

The vice president then pivoted to describing the horrific conditions in Gaza without naming Israel as the party responsible for the humanitarian crisis there.







“I also expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” Harris said, calling the war “devastating”.

“The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety — sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time — we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent.”

She also voiced support for Biden’s multi-phasedceasefire proposalto achieve an end to the war and release Israeli captives in Gaza. Israel and Hamas have been negotiating indirectly for months to finalise the agreement, but a solution has remained elusive so far.

At least on the surface, Harris’s tone appeared like a departure from Biden’s pro-Israel statements. “Harris created distance from Biden on Gaza by emphasizing Palestinian suffering,” a Washington Post headline read after the vice president’s comments.

However, Hazami Barmada, an Arab American activist who has beenorganising protestsin the US capital to bring awareness to the situation in Gaza, said that the vice president’s public statement of sympathy “does not make a difference”.

Barmada pointed out that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he sees his own kids in the faces of the children in Gaza. Still, Blinken’s department has continued to approve billions of dollars in weapons for Israel.

“So no, I don’t think empathy is enough,” Barmada told Al Jazeera. “We have had on our television screens genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, illegal occupation, violence, all types of atrocities happening against Palestinians for 76 years. We need to move past empathy into a place of action before it’s too late.”

Harris appears set to inherit the Democratic nomination from Biden,who stepped outof the presidential race on Sunday and instead endorsed the vice president.

With no serious opposition, Biden had won the overwhelming majority of votes in the Democratic primaries. But hundreds of thousands of people across the country chose the “uncommitted” option on Democratic primary ballots to express opposition to the president’s Gaza policy.

Theuncommitted movementhas articulated three main policy demands: achieving an enduring ceasefire, imposing an arms embargo on Israel and lifting the siege on Gaza.

Tariq Habash, a former Biden administration appointee, acknowledged the change of tone from Harris and called it “refreshing”. In January, he resigned from the Department of Education in a display of public opposition to US support for the war.

But Habash likewise said that Harris should be prepared to follow her rhetoric with action.

“What we really need, nine and a half months in, is a change in policy, a change in approach, so that we can end the unnecessary and indiscriminate violence that has continued every single day under President Biden,” Habash told Al Jazeera.

“It’s still early, so we don’t know exactly what her plan or approach will be, but based on what she said yesterday, I don’t think substantively we heard a shift or any real departure from what the president has already said or done.”

After all, Harris is a key member of the Biden administration, which has been unflinchingly supportive of Israel.

On Thursday, White House spokespersonJohn Kirbysaid the vice president has been a “full partner” in overseeing US policy on the war.







Harris, a former senator, also has her own long pro-Israel record.

Days into her Senate tenure in 2017, Harris co-sponsored a measure to condemn a United Nations Security Council resolutionthat denouncedIsrael’s illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.

She also addressed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) later that year, at a time when many left-wing politicians were distancing themselves from the pro-Israel lobby group.

“Having grown up in the [San Francisco] Bay Area, I fondly remember those Jewish National Fund boxes that we would use to collect donations to plant trees for Israel,” Harris told an AIPAC conference in 2017.

For years, Palestinian historians and activists have accused the Jewish National Fund of using tree-planting to cover ethnically cleansed Palestinian villages in what is today Israel.

Harris, however, was one of the first US officials to use the word “ceasefire” while calling for a truce in Gaza in May.

With the outbreak of the war last year, she showed compassion for Palestinians killed by Israel in the conflict.

“It is absolutely tragic when there is ever, anywhere, any loss of innocent life, of innocent civilians, of children,” she said in November.

But when asked specifically about an Israeli attack thatkilled dozensof people in Jabalia, she said: “We are not telling Israel how it should conduct this war. And so, I’m not going to speak to that.”







US-manufactured and supplied bombs have continued to fall on people across Gaza since then, with a suffocating Israeli blockade deepening the humanitarian crisis there.

On Thursday, dozens of USmedical professionalswho worked in Gaza penned a letter to Harris, Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, describing the deteriorating situation in the territory.

“With only marginal exceptions, everyone in Gaza is sick, injured or both,” they wrote.

The doctors and nurses shared harrowing details of the impact of Israel’s war, including widespread malnourishment, ailments and children shot in the head and chest regularly arriving for treatment.

For many Palestinian rights advocates, ending this nightmare takes precedence over other issues. They say they are willing to vote for thevice presidentif she reconsiders the US’s unconditional support for Israel.

“While nice words don’t bring back our dead, actions now can save the living,” YL Al-Sheikh, a Palestinian American writer and organiser active with the Democratic Socialists of America, told Al Jazeera.

“And so it is not too late to save the rest of Gaza, and it’s not too late to turn the tide for Palestine because we’re not going to go anywhere. They’re going to have to contend with us. So, I think that there’s certainly a degree to which we are going to be receptive to change, and that we should demand that.”

Abdelhadi, the sociologist, also expressed readiness to vote for Harris if she changes the US approach to Israel.

“I’m willing to be won over. However, she hasn’t won me over yet, and only material changes can win me over,” Abdelhadi told Al Jazeera.

For his part, Habash called for urgency from Harris to address the issue.

“There are a lot of people who want to find a way to support the eventual Democratic nominee, but it’s the vice president’s responsibility to earn those votes at this moment,” he told Al Jazeera.

Hours before meeting Netanyahu, Harris released a statement condemning demonstrators who had rallied in Washington, DC, to protest against the Israeli prime minister’sspeech to Congress.

A few protesters had brought down the American flag at Union Station, near the Capitol, and sprayed graffiti in the area. But the overwhelming majority of demonstratorswere peaceful.

Harris denounced what she called “despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fuelled rhetoric” at the anti-Netanyahu demonstration.

“I support the right to peacefully protest, but let’s be clear: Anti-Semitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation,” the vice president said in a statement.

Activists accused Harris’s statement of lacking nuance and failing to acknowledge what the demonstrators had gathered to reject: thefalsehood-filledspeech of a leader accused of war crimes.

Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court are currently seeking a warrant for Netanyahu’s arrest over what they describe as “crimes against humanity”.

The@VPis *clear* about the pro-Hamas protestors:

“I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews.”

“…Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation.”pic.twitter.com/wl2Ph1ZXjS

— Shelley Greenspan (@ShelleyGspan)July 25, 2024



Given that context, Barmada, the Washington-based organiser, called Harris’s statement about the protesters “disturbing”.

She said Harris used the actions of a few individuals to “smear the credibility of legitimate protesters who have legitimate concerns with our tax dollars being used for things that violate American constitutional law, like funding a genocide”.

Before condemning the protesters and calling them “pro-Hamas”, Harris’s camp hit another familiar pro-Israel note.

Earlier this week, her husband Doug Emhoff told Jewish Democratic groups: “Vice President Harris has been and will be a strong supporter of Israel as a secure democratic and Jewish state, and she will always ensure that Israel can defend itself — period. That’s who Kamala Harris is.”

Samra’a Luqman, an Arab American activist in the key swing state of Michigan, told Al Jazeera that Harris represents the status quo.

“She will effectively continue arming Israel even as they act with impunity while paying lip service to try to win the election,” Luqman said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/kamala-harris-shifts-tone-on-gaza-but-advocates-say-us-voters-want-more,POSITIVE,0.9673288464546204
Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris warns Israel of ‘consequences’ of Rafah assault,"Israel could face “consequences” if it launches a ground assault on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, the US vice president has warned.

Vice President Kamala Harris said in an interview that aired on Sunday that it would be a “huge mistake” for the Israeli military to move on the city. The comments appear to underscore the continued strain in relations between Washington and Israel as the latter’s war in Gaza continues.

The United States and other Israeli allies continue to warn against an assault on Rafah, where over 1 million Palestinian civilians are sheltering.

“We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake,” Harris told ABC’s This Week.

“I have studied the maps – there’s nowhere for those folks to go. And we’re looking at about a million and a half people in Rafah who are there because they were told to go there,” Harris added.

“I am ruling out nothing,” Harris said when she was asked whether there would be consequences from the US if the Israeli operation in the overcrowded city goes ahead.

She did not give details of what such consequences might entail. “We’re going to take it one step at a time, but we’ve been very clear in terms of our perspective on whether or not that should happen,” she said.







US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that a major ground assault on the town of Rafah would be “a mistake” and “unnecessary”.

Israel has waged a deadly military offensive on the Palestinian territory since Hamas attacked it on October 7, killing about 1,200 and taking over 200 people captive.

The Israeli military has also imposed a crippling blockade that has left much of the population on the verge of starvation.

More than 32,200 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive and over 74,500 injured. Approximately 1.5 million Palestinians have now been pushed into Rafah.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Blinken’s comments by insisting that Israel is working on ways to evacuate civilians from combat zones and to address the humanitarian needs of Gaza.

“I also said that we have no way to defeat Hamas without entering Rafah,” Netanyahu added. “I told him that I hope we would do this with US support but if necessary we will do it alone.”







Resistance to US support for Israel’s military operations in Gaza continues to grow. On Friday, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on the US tosuspend weapons transfersto Israel.

The US is Israel’s top weapons supplier. Washington provides at least $3.8bn in aid to Israel annually, and Biden isworking with Congressto secure another $14bn.

Public opinion polls, however, show that the Biden administration’s steadfast support for Israel may cost the president votes as the election season gets under way, and Biden and key Democrats have in recent weeks been more forceful in their criticism of the Israeli government siege of Gaza.

However, White House officials insist that Washington will not halt its weapon transfers to Israel, and insist that they share Israel’s goal of eliminating Hamas in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/25/kamala-harris-says-us-wont-rule-out-consequences-if-israel-invades-rafah,NEGATIVE,0.9963405132293701
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"In a one-two upheaval in US politics, President Joe Biden has said he willnot run for re-electionin November and instead endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.

Harris alreadymade historyby becoming the first Black and female vice president in US history, but has faced concerns over whether she can defeat Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump.

The coming days will showif Harris will indeed be embracedby the party and chosen as their candidate at the Democratic National Convention next month.

On Sunday, Biden called the decision to pick former prosecutor Harris for his 2020 ticket “the best decision I’ve made”, while calling on Democrats to support her.

“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” Biden said in a post on X.

Here’s what we know about Harris:

Harris, 59, was born in Oakland, California, the daughter of anIndian-born mother and Jamaican-born father.

She attended Howard University in Washington, DC before getting her law degree from the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.

She began working in the Alameda County district attorney’s office, before shifting to the San Francisco district attorney’s office.

She became San Francisco’s district attorney in 2003. She was then elected California’s attorney general, the state’s top law enforcement role, in 2010 and was re-elected four years later.







She was elected to the US Senate in 2016 and became a leading critic of Trump, particularly when it came to his immigration policies.

Her aggressive questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 helped solidify her credentials as one of the Democratic Party’s top rising stars.

Harris is married to lawyer Doug Emhoff, who became the first “second gentleman” in US history following the 2020 election. Harris and Emhoff have no children.

Harrisinitially mounteda run for the White House in the 2020 election, but quickly faded in the primary season after lacklustre debate performances.

As Biden solidified his lead in 2020, he vowed he would select a woman as his running mate. The selection of Harris was seen as an effort to appeal to Black voters, and to energise the party’s base.

Harris’s law enforcement credentials and centrist approach were also seen as assets that could draw undecided voters away from Trump, although her history also roiled the progressive wing of the party.

In a 2019 debate, Harris had also challenged Biden on race, a viral moment that many thought may have ended her chances of becoming the vice president once he became the party’s nominee.

Harris has collected several superlatives in her career, becoming the first Black woman to hold almost every role she’s had: the district attorney of San Francisco, California’s attorney general, senator from California and vice president.

Harris was also the first daughter of immigrants ever elected as vice president.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Jennifer Victor, a professor at George Mason University, described Harris as a “very typical vice president”.

Harris has largely cheerled signature policies of the Biden administration, including infrastructure legislation, immigration, gun control and efforts to protect abortion rights.

In particular, Harris has been tasked with spearheading efforts to stem migration from Central America.

“Her popularity numbers haven’t been too high, but she also hasn’t had a lot of press coverage,” Victor said. “She has not been in the big spotlight of political discourse over the last few years … but I think what we’re going to see is a massive ramping up.”







That remains the big question for Democrats.

Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said that while Biden has endorsed Harris, it does not mean she will receive support from the Democratic Party, which hasless than a monthuntil its convention starts.

“Democrats might not want to fight on the convention floor in Chicago,” Fisher said. “This looks unseemly, and so they may well quickly coalesce around Kamala Harris, and then look to put in a vice president who will perhaps help them in other areas”.

Recent polls taken after Biden’s weak debate performance against Trump have not suggested that Harris is likelier than Biden to beat Trump in November. Harris supporters have argued those polls may change now that Biden is out of the race.

For instance, an Economist/YouGov poll released last week found Biden would lose to Trump 41 percent to 43 percent. The poll showed Harris losing to Trump 39 percent to 44 percent.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll found both Biden and Harris performing the same against Trump: A statistical toss-up.

Harris has described herself as a “progressive prosecutor”, but she has made few inroads with the progressive wing of the party.

While Harris did oversee some reforms in her career, critics have accused her of at best taking a mixed-bag approach in her policies.

That included a controversial truancy enforcement push as San Francisco’s district attorney that saw parents face penalties for their children missing school.

Her office also worked to prevent the release of more prisoners, despite massive overcrowding in California prisons. And as the state’s attorney general, Harris argued a case defending the use of the death penalty in California, despite being personally against it.

Long hailed as the future of the Democratic Party, Harris has also faced criticism that she has not lived up to expectations. Detractors have said she lacks the charisma to rally the party.

On Israel-Palestine, Harris has hewed close to the Biden administration’s “ironclad” support for Israel and she has regularly defended Israel’s right to self-defence, including during the war on Gaza.

She is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week when he visits the US.

Still, Harris has been one of the more vocal members of the administration highlighting the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the enclave. In March, she became the highest-ranking member of the administration touse the word “ceasefire”in calling for a humanitarian pause in the fighting.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"As United States Vice President Kamala Harris crisscrosses the country – and especially key battleground states – before the November 5 election, an unlikely cheerleader has accompanied her on several occasions: Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman from Wyoming and daughter of ex-Vice President Dick Cheney.

The senior Cheney has long been pilloried by Democrats for his central role in pushing for – and executing – the invasion of Iraq in 2003 on grounds that turned out to be fake. And Liz Cheney has embraced her father’s neoconservative legacy throughout her career.









Yet a shared animus for Donald Trump, the former president and Republican Party nominee for the presidency, has brought Cheney into Harris’s camp. Cheney has been joined by many prominent, old-school Republicans in criticising Trump and endorsing Harris.

But what is in it for Harris? Can Liz Cheney’s enthusiastic support help her win Republican voters in a race poised on a knife’s edge? Or could it end up hurting Harris’s prospects?

In recent weeks, Harris and Cheney have jointly held a series of town hall sessions in the vital battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, under the banner “Country over Party”. Harris and Trump are separated byless than one percentage pointin each of the three states.

Cheney has been a staunch critic of Trump and supported the former president’s second impeachment after the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol.

“I know the most conservative of all conservative principles is being faithful to the Constitution,” Cheney said at a recent rally. “You have to choose in this race between someone who has been faithful to the constitution, who will be faithful, and Donald Trump, who, it’s not just us predicting how he will act. We’ve watched what he did after the last election. We watched what he did on Jan 6.”

In an event in Wisconsin, she said: “I watch how our presidents have operated and even when there have been presidents that we have potentially disagreed with on issues, they’ve respected the Constitution.”

Harris, too, has characterised Trump as someone unfit for the role of president.

“Donald Trump is an unserious man but the consequences of him being president of the United States are brutally serious,” stated Harris.

A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted between September 30 and October 15, 74 percent of voters in battleground states have already decided who to vote for. The remaining 26 percent of voters are still undecided.

Seven battleground states – also known as swing states – are expected to determine the outcome of the election. Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina, where Harris and Trump are in close contests, collectively account for 93 Electoral College votes – a third of the 270 votes needed to win the 538-strong Electoral College, and thus, the election.

It is the undecided Republican voters that Harris hopes to tap, using Cheney’s help, say analysts.

“If you’re the Democratic Party, you’re still trying to pursue a vote maximisation strategy, and that means expanding your pathways to victory,” Adolphus Belk, professor of political science and African American studies at Winthrop University, told Al Jazeera. “Particularly in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, where there are some Republican voters who supported Trump in 2016, but are now seriously considering voting Democrat.”

The January 6, 2021 Capitol riot by Trump supporters, and the former president’s often confusing positions on the reproductive rights of women – he has claimed credit for the dismantling of the Supreme Court judgement that guaranteed abortion rights but has also suggested he would oppose a national ban on abortion – are among the issues that have left some Republican voters wary of a second Trump term, say analysts.

There is some evidence that Harris’s strategy of building a bipartisan coalition with anti-Trump Republicans could help her campaign.

According to a recent New York Times-Siena poll, 9 percent of Republican voters nationally said they would vote for Harris. More importantly, a separate Wall Street Journal poll in the second week of October found that in Arizona, where Trump and Harris are tied in a dead heat, 8 percent of Republicans are voting for Harris.

Belk notes that the Harris-Cheney strategy is nothing new for the Democratic Party. It is part of a centrist playbook that emerged from the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) founded in 1985 by several high-ranking Democrats, including then-Governor Bill Clinton. Although the DLC’s last active year was 2011, the methods are the same.

“They (DLC) believe that the pathway forward was to moderate, that you maximise your votes by moving more toward the centre on the very issues that Republicans had used to punish you in presidential elections,” explained Belk.

“I think the Harris-Cheney team-up is about getting certain Republicans, including former members of the Trump administration, to signal to those Republican voters who are contemplating voting for Harris, but are maybe hesitant – to say to those people, for this contest, in this moment, you can make this choice and it’s OK.”

While Trump routed rivals in the Republican primary, there were still significant numbers of GOP voters who backed former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Chris Christie, former governor of New Jersey, Belk noted. These voters were highly educated and typically college graduates who leaned politically moderate.

When the margins between Trump and Harris are as tight as they are – less than 1 percentage point now separates them in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada – a few thousand Republican votes could make all the difference for the vice president.

“They’re going after the Haley voters. And that’s why you go on Fox,” Belk said, referring to Kamala Harris’s interview on Fox News with Bret Baier on October 16. Fox is a favourite among conservative voters.

For years, the Cheney name has been almost toxic for liberals in the US, associated with the foreign policy debacles of the Bush administration.

This is especially so for Arab American and Muslim voters, whose communities were more directly affected by the war in Iraq and the rising Islamophobia in the US.

Some analysts believe Harris risks alienating these voters – many of whom are already deeply upset with her for the Biden administration’s unflinching support for Israel’s war on Gaza – further by proudly touting her Cheney endorsement.

“There are a number of liberal and progressive Democrats that feel upset about the embrace of Dick and Liz Cheney,” Belk acknowledged.

Normally, he said, this might not be a major problem for Harris. “The way that vote maximisation strategy works is they look at it and think, if you’re a liberal, progressive Democrat, we’re kind of your only game in town,” he said. “If you’re a really conservative Trump Republican, we know you’re not going to come to us, but we can get those people in the middle because there are more of you.”

But this time, sufficient numbers of Arab American and Muslim voters are signalling that for them, Democrats are not the “only game in town” because of Gaza.

Last month, a Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) poll showed that in Michigan, home to a large Arab American community and key battleground state, 40 percent of Muslim voters backed the Green Party’s Jill Stein. Donald Trump received 18 percent support with 12 percent of voters backing Harris.

In an Arab News/YouGov poll released at the start of this week, Trump actually leads Harris 45 percent to 43 percent among the key demographic, nationally.

Trump appears to have caught on to this drop in support for Harris among Arab Americans over the war in Gaza.

“Kamala is also in total free fall with the Arab and Muslim population in Michigan. She’s in a free fall,” Trump said on Friday, addressing a rally in Traverse City, Michigan. “She sent their jobs overseas, brought crime to their cities, and tonight in the Middle East, it’s like a tinderbox that’s ready to explode. People are being killed at levels we’ve never seen before.”

He also directly referred to Harris’s alliance with Cheney.

“And why would Muslims support Kamala when she embraces Muslim-hating Liz Cheney?” Trump asked. “Can you believe it? Liz Cheney, a total loser, whose father brought years of war and death to the Middle East. Why would you support somebody if you’re from the Middle East or even associated with the Middle East – why would you be supporting somebody with a Cheney family? [sic] The father killed more Arabs than any human being on earth. He pushed Bush, and they went into the Middle East.”

The Cheney association could also affect the overall support that Harris receives from Black Americans.

According to Pew Research Center, African Americans account for 20 percent of the Muslim population in the US. A recent New York Times-Siena College national poll reported that 70 percent of Black male voters support Harris, whereas 85 percent of Black men supported Biden in 2020.

In short, Belk said the Harris campaign faces tough choices.

“So it’s aid with one hand [for Gaza] and bombs with the other. The administration did try to put certain pressures on [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, but Netanyahu is not yielding to those pressures,” Belk said.

“And that conflict has gone on now for well over a year and has seemingly expanded into other nation-states in the region. So that has been a great problem for this administration.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/25/can-liz-cheney-help-kamala-harriss-campaign-or-will-she-hurt-her,POSITIVE,0.7429532408714294
Kamala Harris,Who is Kamala Harris?,"First-term United States Senator Kamala Harris’s star was already rising fast when she jumped into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in early 2019. Liberals in the party loved her for being the face of the party’s future – a young, Black woman.

Despite entering the race as an immediate frontrunner, Harris, who was also the only African-American woman running, was out by the end of the year – before even the Iowa caucuses. Her struggle to maintain support was driven by an inability to articulate clear policy positions and a backlash from an attempt to attack rival Joe Biden’s record on race during a June 2019 debate.









Many thought the dust-up ended her chances of being considered for the vice president slot. But they were wrong.

Harris, 55, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, is a former California state attorney general who became popular with liberal activists for her tough questioning of appointees and officials from the administration of President Donald Trump – including Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, during Senate hearings.

As one of the earliest congressional critics of Trump’s immigration policies, Harris pushed hard for a deal to protect from deportation those immigrants who came to the country without documents as children, a group known as the Dreamers.

Harris made history in 2016 when she became the first Black woman elected to the US Senate from California, and she has pushed back against critics of “identity politics”, who she says are using the term as a pejorative to marginalise issues of race, gender and sexual orientation.

She was among a handful of Democrats who aggressively questioned Kavanaugh at his Supreme Court confirmation hearing about his views on abortion and on the special counsel probe into potential Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

In the Senate, she introduced a bill to give lower-income families cash payments and tax credits to help battle wage stagnation and rising housing costs, and she has been a strong advocate of criminal justice reforms.









In a memoir published in 2019, Harris described herself as a “progressive prosecutor” and said it is a “false choice” to decide between supporting the police and advocating for greater scrutiny of law enforcement.

She is, however, no favourite of progressives in the Democratic party. Many have criticised her record, including her sometimes reluctant approach to criminal justice reform and her fighting against lawsuits brought by sex workers and opponents of solitary confinement in prisons.

She also came under scrutiny for declining as attorney general to prosecute OneWest Bank, which was once headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, for alleged foreclosure violations.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"US Vice PresidentKamala Harrison Monday cemented her status as the frontrunner in the race to succeed President Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s nominee for the November presidential election,winning a wave of endorsementsfrom governors, elected officials and state-level leaders.

The most important among those endorsements was Biden’s ringing support forher candidature, which he made clear right as he announced, on Sunday, that he would no longer be seeking the party’s nomination, following weeks of pressure to step aside.

Harris will still need to formally win the nomination, likely at the Democratic National Convention in August, and not all of thepotential challengersfor the candidature have fallen behind her — so far, at least.

Yet the 59-year-old Harris could be on track to becoming the first Black woman to lead a major party’s presidential ticket, bringing her position on key global issues under scrutiny.

So what has Harris’s stance been on major foreign policy matters and countries?

Analysts expect Harris, if elected, to largely continue Biden’s approach to the Gaza war: She has repeatedly pledged support for Israel’s security and self-defence, while expressing sympathy for Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

Harris hasdefendedIsrael’sright to self-defence. In December 2023, she said during a briefing “Israel has a right to defend itself. And we [Biden and Harris] will remain steadfast in that conviction” and “we support Israel’s legitimate military objectives to eliminate the threat of Hamas”.

This week, Harris is expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahuduring his visit to the US.

At the same time, in the December briefing, she said: “As Israel pursues its military objectives in Gaza, we believe Israel must do more to protect innocent civilians.”

On March 4, Harriscalled for an immediate trucein Gaza, adding that Israel needs to improve the flow of humanitarian aid in the enclave.

The death of seven humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen in Gaza, including one American, is a devastating tragedy. The investigation must be swift, and steps must be taken to ensure this does not happen again.

Israel must do more to protect aid workers who are…

On April 14, Harris posted on X a day afterIran’s attacks on Israel, saying “Our support for Israel’s security is ironclad.”

Consistent with Biden’s stance, Harris strongly backs Ukraine’s self-defence efforts against Russia. Harris has also been — just like Biden — a committed supporter of NATO.

In June, she met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at theSummit on Peace in Ukrainein Switzerland.

“Russia’s aggression is not only an attack on the lives and the freedom of the people of Ukraine, it is not only an attack on global food security and energy supplies,” she said at the summit’s opening plenary.

At the summit, Harris also announced that the US would disburse $1.5bn through the US Agency for International Development and the US Department of State, to strengthen Ukraine’s energy sector.

At the Munich Security Conference in February, she rebuked Russia’s war on Ukraine and pledged “ironclad” US respect for NATO’s Article 5, under which an attack on any one member of the alliance requires all other nations in the grouping to join the conflict.

Harris is expected to remain consistent with Biden’s policy on China — focusing on curbing Chinese influence, especially in Asia.

In September, she attended asummitof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta. During the summit,she accused Chinaof imposing its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea on smaller neighbours. Biden also assigned Harris to visit Japan and South Korea, key allies in the region.

During thevice-presidential debate in 2020, she criticised former President Donald Trump’stariffs on Chinese imports, accusing the Republican of losing a trade war with China and as a result, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs — though some analysts say the jobs were lost because of COVID-19, not Trump’s policies. These tariffs have mostly remained in place during the Biden administration.

Harris has also backed Taiwan, and is expected to continue if she becomes president. In September 2022, she pledged “We will continue to support Taiwan’s self-defence, consistent with our long-standing policy”.

Harris’s position on India has seen a shift over the past five years.

Time and time again during public appearances, the daughter of an Indian-born mother and a Jamaican-born father has mentioned herIndian heritageand how important the country is to her.

In 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi revokedArticle 370, ending thesemi-autonomous statusof Indian-administered Kashmir. Harris rebuked this move, saying “We have to remind the Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world.” She was a senator from California at the time, and a potential Democratic hopeful for the 2020 election.

However, when Biden came into office, Harris’s approach towards India saw a change. In 2021, she had a public meeting with Modi andpraised India’s rolein producing COVID-19 vaccines.

The US and India share common concerns over China, making India a strategic partner for the US in Asia. Biden has forged a series ofdefence and technology agreementswith Modi during his time in office.

In 2023, Harris hosted Modi at a state luncheon where she thanked the Indian PM for his “role of leadership to help India emerge as a global power in the 21st century,” lauding his leadership of theGroup of 20 summitlast year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/22/how-kamala-harris-views-the-world-from-gaza-and-russia-to-china-and-india,POSITIVE,0.9985944628715515
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"President Joe Bidenhas dropped out from the US electionand endorsed Vice PresidentKamala Harris. While many Democrats have rallied behind Biden’s decision and shown their support for Harris, some prominent voices have refrained from endorsing her.

While Biden’s endorsement of Harris led to a wave of immediate support from their fellow Democrats, two party leaders were among the initial holdouts: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.









Both menissuedstatementson Sunday praising Biden’s leadership — but they noticeably did not throw their backing behind Harris.

That changed on Tuesday, as Schumer and Jeffries held a joint press conference from Capitol Hill.

“Today is a great, great day for the Democratic Party and the country. Vice President Harris will soon be our nominee and will be elected president in November,” Schumer said, opening the briefing. “We are brimming with excitement, enthusiasm, unity.”

He noted the speed with which his fellow party members coalesced behind Harris. “President Biden’s selfless decision has given the Democratic Party the opportunity to unite behind a new nominee, and boy, oh boy, are we enthusiastic.”

Another prominent Democratic figure to delay his endorsement of Harris was none other than Barack Obama, the first Black president of the US.

But on Friday — five days after Biden exited the race — Harris released avideoon YouTube showing herself taking a call from Obama and his wife Michelle.

“I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl Kamala: I am proud of you. This is going to be historic,” Michelle said in the video.

“We called to say Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” Barack added.

Like Schumer and Jeffries, Barack Obama had been quick to praise Biden in the hours immediately after his withdrawal. But the delay in his endorsement of Harris raised eyebrows, as the Obamas remain powerful figures in the Democratic Party — and big draws for donors.

Joe Biden has been one of America’s most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me. Today, we’ve also been reminded – again – that he’s a patriot of the highest order.

On Monday, Harris won the crucial backing of Democratic heavyweight Nancy Pelosi, the former US House speaker and a key figure in ousting the 81-year-old Biden.

“With immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future, I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States,” Pelosi, 84, said in a message on X.

“I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November.”

In a joint statement, former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the Democratic nominee in 2016, endorsed Harris as the presidential candidate.

“Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we’ve got to elect her,” the Clintons said in a joint statement posted on X. “America’s future depends on it.” They also recognised Biden’s accomplishments and his presidency.

Several prominent Democrats, including some who were previouslyconsidered potential contendersfor the party’s nomination, have also supported Harris. They include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.

“With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump’s dark vision,” Newsom said in a statement on X. The post came more than five hours after an initial post reacting to Biden’s decision to exit the race.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer initially kept their statements limited to praise for Biden, but followed up with a Harris endorsement the next day.

The two were also viewed as potential challengers to Harris for the Democratic nomination after Biden dropped out.

Whitmer, who has had several high-profile clashes with Trump, returned to taking on the Republican candidate in recent days on issues such as abortion rights. Following several terms in the state legislature, Whitmer has served as Michigan’s governor since 2019. She is also vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.

“Today, not only am I fired up to endorse Kamala Harris for President of the United States, I’m proud to serve as a co-chair of her campaign,” she announced on X.

While Michigan is a coveted swing state, Pritzker’s home state of Illinois is a Democratic stronghold. A lawyer by training, Pritzker has won two terms as governor and previously served as co-chair for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign.

Pete Buttigieg, the transport secretary and 2020 Democratic rival who Biden included in his cabinet, also endorsed the vice president.

“Kamala Harris is now the right person to take up the torch, defeat Donald Trump, and succeed Joe Biden as president,” he said in a statement posted on X.

Other governors who have supported Harris include North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Colorado’s Jared Polis and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.

Congresswomen Cori Bush and Ilhan Omar – who, like Ocasio-Cortez, are members of the party’s progressive wing, known as the so-called Squad – also rallied behind Harris.

Senator Warren from Massachusetts, who also fought for the Democratic nomination in 2020, endorsed Harris. “She is a proven fighter,” Warren said.

“Madam Vice President, we are ready to help,” Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz wrote on X.

Other Senate Democrats who endorsed Harris include Mark Warner of Virginia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Alex Padilla of California and Patty Murray of Washington state.

Tina Smith of Minnesota also expressed her support, while other incumbents such as Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jacky Rosen of Nevada rallied behind her. Both Brown and Rosen face strong challenges in the upcoming election.

According to local media reports, at least 26 Democratic senators have endorsed Harris, more than half of the party’s 51 members in the Senate.

Some state delegations to the Democratic National Convention expressed their support for Harris.

The final decision on whether Harris stays will rest with the roughly 4,000 delegates who will vote for the next person in August. Earlier, the delegates pledged support to Biden. But they are under no obligation to support his choice.

However, according to reports,at least 531 delegateshave announced their support for Harris. These include the Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina delegations, among others.

The influential Congressional Black Caucus as well as the country’s six Black state attorneys general have thrown their support behind Harris.

Representatives Gregory Meeks and Steven Horsford said in a statement that Harris “will do an excellent job” as president of the US while the state attorneys general said “There is no one more qualified to lead and continue to uphold the values of our great nation.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/22/us-election-after-biden-who-has-endorsed-kamala-harris-and-who-hasnt,POSITIVE,0.9246807098388672
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Washington, DC –Ina speechfrom the Ellipse adjoining the White House – also known as the President’s Park – one week from Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris drew a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump, calling him a “petty tyrant” and repeating a line she has used in recent days – that she would begin her presidential term not with an enemies list, but with a to-do list.

Harris spoke at the site where Trump delivered his “Save America” rally ahead of theJanuary 6, 2021, Capitol riot. During the October 29 speech, Harris said Trump had been “at this very spot … and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election”.

In her speech’s first half, Harris focused on the risks she believes Trump poses for the country. Later, she shifted towards policy, distinguishing parts of her agenda on taxes, abortion and immigration from Trump’s.

“Politicians have got to stop treating immigration as an issue to scare up votes in an election,” she said, “and instead treat it as the serious challenge that it is.”

Harris’s campaign said the attendance was 75,000, which would be the largest crowd of her campaign. The House Select Committee that investigated the events of January 6, 2021, said the “Save America” rally drew 53,000 people. About two hours before Harris began speaking, lines of supporters snaked around fencing near the Ellipse site, running for blocks and reaching well into the National Mall. Campaign volunteers worked the lines to sign up attendees for an app that lets them canvass other voters.







Here’s a rundown of six notable moments, fact-checked.

Harris accurately said 140 law enforcement officers were injured in the January 6, 2021, attack. Trump has repeatedly called the defendants charged in the attack “hostages” or “warriors” and promised topardonthose who stormed the Capitol.

In September 2022, two months before he announced his campaign, Trump told conservative radio host Wendy Bell that he had met with some of the January 6 defendants. “I will look very very favourably about full pardons,” he said, adding, “I mean full pardons, with an apology to many.”

In a March Truth Social post, he promised that one of his “first acts” as president would be to “Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!” And he told Time Magazine in April he would “consider” pardoning every one of them.

More than 1,500 defendants have been charged in the storming of the Capitol, Justice Department data shows. About 571 were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement agents or officers or obstructing those officers during a civil disorder, including approximately 164 defendants charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.







Trump has repeatedly talked about the “enemy from within” in his October speeches and interviews.

Trump told Fox News’ Howard Kurtz on October 20 that Representative Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats from California, are “the enemy from within”. However, Trump is often vague when he uses this phrase. Trump says that the “enemy from within” is a “bigger enemy” than foreign enemies, such asChina or Russia.

He sometimes uses the phrase shortly after speaking about President Joe Biden or Harris, as he did on October 27 in hisMadison Square Garden rallyin New York City.

“We’re running against something far bigger than Joe or Kamala and far more powerful than them, which is a massive, vicious, crooked, radical left machine that runs today’s Democrat Party. They’re just vessels. In fact, they’re perfect vessels because they’ll never give them a hard time. They’ll do whatever they want. I know many of them. It’s just this amorphous group of people. But they’re smart and they’re vicious. And we have to defeat them.

“And when I say ‘the enemy from within’, the other side goes crazy … ‘How can he say now they’ve done very bad things to this country?’ They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we’re fighting.”

On October 13, Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo asked Trump about the possibility of Election Day chaos. Trump warned of “very bad people”, “radical left lunatics” who should be handled if “necessary” by the National Guard or the military.

This is misleading.

Since April,Trump has consistently saidabortion legislation should be left to the states. He has said that he would not sign a national abortion ban. As president, however, Trump endorsed a 20-week national abortion ban. Early in his 2024 presidential campaign, he floated support for 15 or 16-week federal abortion bans, news outlets reported.

Trump said in a May interview with CBS News that he was “looking at” birth control restrictions, but he quickly tried to clarify his words, writing on Truth Social: “I have never and will never advocate for imposing restrictions on birth control.”

Trumphas expressed supportfor in vitro fertilisation during the 2024 campaign amid Democratic criticism that Republicans want to restrict or eliminate the practice. In April, he released a video in which he said he supports making it “easier” for families to have babies, not harder. “That includes supporting the availability of fertility treatments, like IVF, in every state in America,” Trump said. He has also recently proposed having the government cover IVF costs or requiring insurers to do so. He hasn’t said how he would do this.

Nothing in Trump’s Agenda 47 requires states to monitor women’s pregnancies. Instead,Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s 900-page conservative policy manual for the next Republican administration, proposes withholding federal money from states that don’t report more detailed information about how many abortions take place in their states, as well as other statistics for miscarriages and stillbirths to the federal government. The project doesn’t call for the monitoring of all pregnancies.

Half True.

Trump has discussed raising tariffs across the board by 10 percent to 20 percent, so the 20 percent figure Harris cited is on the upper end of what Trump has said. Tariffs are also not technically part of the tax code, but their effect on consumers would be similar in costing them more money.

The $4,000 Harris quoted is on the upper end of independent estimates. Two estimates we found broadly support Harris’s $4,000 amount. Two others show a smaller – though still significant – effect, in the $1,700 to $2,600 range.

Half True.

In his2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and as president, he supported congressional Republicans’ failed efforts to achieve this.

During his 2024 campaign, Trump’s position hasvacillated. At times, he’s said that he wants to replace the law with an “alternative”. But in March, he wrote on Truth Social that he’s “not running to terminate” the law and instead wants to make it “better” and “less expensive”.

During the September 10 presidential debate with Harris in Philadelphia, Trump said he has “concepts of a plan” to replace the law, but he would “run it as good as it can be run” before instituting his own plan without providing further details.

More than 1,500 doctors released a letter on October 17 calling on Trump to reveal details about how he would alter the healthcare law, saying voters need the explanation to make an informed decision.



This needs context.

On Medicare, Trump released four successive annual budgets that proposed cutting Medicare. However, experts are divided on how much those cuts would have hurt beneficiaries had they been enacted. Many were technical changes that had bipartisan support and would have been more likely to hurt providers than patients.

On Social Security, Trump submitted budget proposals that included cuts to Social Security. These were never implemented, because of opposition in Congress.

However, Harris glosses over what these cuts involved. The proposed cuts were focused on two parts of the programme – Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income – not the more widely used old-age and survivor benefits.

Social Security Disability Insurance benefits people with physical and mental conditions that are severe enough to permanently keep them from working. Supplemental Security Income payments are limited to low-income Americans – older adults, or adults or children who are disabled or blind.

Although these cuts would have affected close to 10 million Americans, the pool of people who receive old-age and survivor benefits is almost seven times as large.

Trump has promised in 2024 not to cut either programme.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/fact-check-kamala-harriss-speech-at-the-white-house-ellipse,NEGATIVE,0.9570427536964417
Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris says Iran is ‘greatest adversary’ of US,"US Vice President Kamala Harris says Iran is the most significant enemy of the United States, citing Tehran’s recent ballisticmissile attackagainst Israel.

In an interview with the CBS television network aired on Monday night, the Democratic presidential candidate said Iran is the “obvious” answer when asked about the country she considers to be the US’s “greatest adversary”.

“Iran has American blood on their hands – this attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles,” she said. “What we need to do [is] to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.”

Iran fired abarrage of missilesat Israeli bases last week in an attack that it said was in retaliation for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran as well as the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah alongside an Iranian general in Beirut.

Harris’s comments underscore the re-emergence of the Middle East as a top US concern amid the expanding war in Gaza.







In recent years, US officials have been pushing the strategic competition with China as Washington’s top foreign policy priority.

In 2022, the Pentagonlabelled Chinaas a “pacing challenge” to the US, meaning that it poses a long-term risk.

Earlier that year, the White House’s National Security Strategy, an assessment released every four years, also described the competition with Beijing as Washington’s “most consequential geopolitical challenge”.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has also been a top area of focus for the US, which has been providing military and financial support for Kyiv and imposing sanctions on Moscow.

The violence across the Middle East, however, has turned the US government’s attention again to animosity towards Iran and its alliance with Israel.

Harris was asked whether she would use military force to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, but she said she would not discuss hypotheticals.

Iran denies seeking nuclear arms, but the country has been advancing its nuclear programme.

In 2018, former US President Donald Trump, Harris’s rival in November’s presidential election, nixed themultilateral dealthat saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions against it.

US President Joe Biden came into office with the promise of reviving the pact, but several rounds of indirect talks with Iranian officials have failed to reinstate the agreement.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration continued to enforce Trump-erasanctions against Iranand added dozens of its own against Iranian companies and officials.







Tensions escalated further with the outbreak of the war in Gaza.

When Haniyeh was killed on Iranian soil late in July in an attack widelyblamed on Israel, the Biden administration declined to say whether Iran has a right to defend itself.

After Iran responded with its attack last week, US officials rushed tocondemn itand pledge “severe consequences”.

Harris “unequivocally” denounced the Iranian missile launches. “I am clear-eyed: Iran is a destabilising, dangerous force in the Middle East, and today’s attack on Israel only further demonstrates that fact,” she said on October 1.

The vice president has repeatedly pledged to continue to arm Israel, citing in part what she calls the threat of Iran, despite growing anger over well-documented Israeli abuses in Gaza and Lebanon.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/8/kamala-harris-says-iran-is-greatest-adversary-of-us,NEGATIVE,0.9864953756332397
Kamala Harris,"Five key takeaways from Kamala Harris, Tim Walz’s first major TV interview","Democratic nomineeKamala Harrisand her running mateTim Walzhave appearedon CNNon for their first in-depth interview since launching their bid for the United States presidency.

Harris has faced scrutiny foravoiding a major media interviewsince announcing her candidacy late last month.

But on Thursday, she and Walz met CNN anchor Dana Bash in the coastal city of Savannah for an hour-long interview, as Harris campaigned across the battleground state of Georgia.

Harris quickly tried to establish her bona fides as a unifying candidate, in an attempt to draw a distinction with her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump.

“I believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems,” Harris said as she sat across from Bash in Kim’s Cafe, a family-owned restaurant in Savannah.

But Bash pressed Harris on the stark changes she has made to her policy platform since she first ran for the presidency in 2020. She also questioned Walz on seeming exaggerations the Minnesota governor made in public statements about hismilitary record.

Here are the key takeaways from Harris’s most in-depth interview to date as a presidential candidate.

Harris has a historically short time span before the November 5 election to win over voters.

She only became the frontrunner for the Democratic ticket on July 21, when incumbent President Joe Bidendropped outof the race. Harris is currently Biden’s vice president.

As Thursday’s interview opened, Bash asked Harris about her plans for her first day in office, if she is elected in November.

Harris responded by reiterating what she has identified as the top priority for her presidency: bolstering the middle class.

Her administration, she said, would “do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class”.

She and Walz then gave a nod to their signaturepolicy proposals, including a child tax credit, lowering grocery costs and increasing construction to address a housing shortage in the country. Harris also said she would strike a different tone than Trump in the White House.

“When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think people are ready for a new way forward,” she said.

“I think, sadly, in the last decade, we have had – in the former president – someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the strength and the character of who we are as Americans.”

Later, when asked aboutcomments Trump madequestioning her racial identity, Harris swatted away his remarks: “Same old tired playbook. Next question, please.”

Bash asked Harris to describe how she learned that Biden was withdrawing from the presidential race in July, only weeks ahead of the Democratic National Convention.

“It was a Sunday,” Harris explained. “My family was staying with us, including my baby nieces, and we had just had pancakes.”

“We were sitting down to do a puzzle, and the phone rang, and it was Joe Biden. And he told me what he had decided to do,” Harris continued.

“I asked him, ‘Are you sure?’ And he said yes. And that’s how I learned about it.”

On July 21, Biden announced the news to the US public, with a statement on his social media accounts. “I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down,” he wrote.

But the decision came after Biden gave afumbling performancein the June 28 presidential debate against Trump. Many in the Democratic Party expressed concern over the81-year-old’s age and capacityto handle the pressures of the presidency.

Harris, however, had consistently defended Biden’s ability to lead. Bash prodded Harris to know if she had any regrets about her time in Biden’s White House.

“Not at all. I have served with President Biden for almost four years now, and I can tell you, it’s one of the greatest honours of my career, truly,” Harris said. She called Biden’s presidency “transformative” before taking another swipe at Trump.

Biden, she said, “has the intelligence, the commitment and the judgement and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president. By contrast, the former president has none of that.”

Thursday’s CNN interview came exactly one week after the close of theDemocratic National Conventionwhen Harrisformally acceptedthe party nomination for the presidency.

In her acceptance speech, Harris pledged to be a “president for all Americans”.

In Thursday’s broadcast, she took that promise one step further. When Bash asked if she would consider appointing a Republican to her Cabinet staff – a group of top presidential advisers – Harris immediately said yes.

“I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences,” Harris explained.

“And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.”

Neither of the last two administrations – Trump’s and Biden’s – have appointed Cabinet members from the opposing party. The last president to do so was Democrat Barack Obama, with the appointment of Republicans like Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.

Bash tried to coax Harris into revealing if she had someone in particular on her mind for her Cabinet.

“No one in particular in mind,” Harris replied. “I have 68 days to go in this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse.”

Thursday’s interview took place largely without fireworks, with Harris repeating much of what she has said on the campaign trail.

But Bash zeroed in on reversals Harris made to her policy stance since 2020, when she first campaigned for the presidency.

For instance, when Harris campaigned for president in 2020, she supported Medicare for All legislation championed by progressive Senator Bernie Sanders. She has since backed away from that position.

And in 2019, she told a CNN town hall that she favoured a “Green New Deal” that would include more aggressive policies to combat climate change. “There’s no question I’m in favour of banning fracking,” she said at the time.

After Harris joined Biden in 2020 as his running mate, she quickly retreated from that position, something she pointed out in Thursday’s interview with Bash.

“I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking,” she said, before adding: “As president, I will not ban fracking.”

Seeking to head off accusations that she had flip-flopped, Harris emphasised that she continues to perceive climate change as a major threat – one that can be addressed without a fracking ban.

“Let’s be clear: My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate,” Harris said.

“What I’ve seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.”

Fracking is part of the economy in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, where Trump has used Harris’s 2019 statements as a point of attack. But critics have pointed out that fracking comes with severe risks, including the potential to pollute groundwater used for drinking.

Nevertheless, Harris repeatedly pledged on Thursday that she would not ban fracking if elected president.

“In 2020, I made very clear where I stand,” she said. “I kept my word, and I will keep my word.”

Thursday’s interview comes in the final countdown before the election begins: Some states open their early-voting period as soon as September.

The presidential election is set to be decided by narrow margins, with Trump and Harris in a tight race.

However, on Thursday a poll from Reuters and Ipsos found that Harris had pulled ahead slightly, garnering 45 percent support to Trump’s 41 percent. Harris is also marginally ahead of Trump in most battleground states, according to the latest polls.

Still, Bash raised the prospect that Harris’s stance on Israel’s war in Gaza could cost her votes, particularly among the progressives in her party.

Harris has largely followed Biden’s lead in pledging unconditional support to Israel, despite the spiralling death toll in Gaza and persistent concerns about human rights abuses.

Bash pressed Harris about whether she would set herself apart from Biden: Would she do anything differently?

“Let me be very clear: I am unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defence and its ability to defend itself,” Harris said, repeating a sentiment she also voiced on the Democratic National Convention stage.

But she offered an addendum: “How it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.”

Harris ended by saying, “We have got to get a deal done,” a reference to ongoing negotiations for a ceasefire that has thus far remained elusive.

After recording the CNN interview, Harris continued to her final stop on her August campaign tour of Georgia: a rally at Savannah’s Enmarket Arena.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"I registered to vote in 1998, and I have voted Democrat ever since. I have not always felt good about the candidates on the Democratic ticket. In fact, I have usually felt angry, disillusioned, disappointed and dirty after casting my vote. Still, it felt like part of the job of being a citizen of a pseudo-democracy. It was not the only work to be done, but it was something.

This November, however, I plan not to vote for the Democrats in the election. If the party’s presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, does not change her policy on Israel, I will not be casting a ballot for her.









And I will not be the only one. More than 700,000 Americans have cast an “uncommitted” vote in the Democratic primaries, demonstrating their rejection of the Democratic Party’s “ironclad” support for Israel.

If Harris wants the progressive vote, she has to support an arms embargo on Israel and stop funding the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This is a red line for many of us who have not bought into her liberal cult of personality.

When President Joe Biden finally dropped out as the 2024 Democratic nominee on July 21, I was not one of the many people celebrating his endorsement of the vice president. Harris was on the wrong side of history as San Francisco’s district attorney when she opposed criminal justice reform, and she has been on the wrong side of history in regards to Israel, which she is a staunch supporter of.

Still, a small part of me hoped she would be savvy enough to understand the power of the “uncommitted” movement – which is conditioning voting on support for an embargo on Israel and a permanent ceasefire in Gaza – and the level of outrage felt by those opposed to the ongoing genocide, funded these past 10 months by US aid. I was wrong.

Ata rally in Detroit on August 7, Harris was met by a group of anti-genocide, pro-Palestine protesters chanting, “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide! We won’t vote for genocide!” In a democracy, this is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable (if not necessary) action. Politicians serve the people, and the people have the right (and the responsibility) to make demands on their political leaders, especially when the latter are asking for their votes and campaign donations.

Yet Harris decided to respond: “You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”

What purpose does this attitude serve? The protesters were merely expressing their demand that Harris pledge to stop arming Israel amid its genocidal war on Gaza. A war that has brought the official death toll in Gaza to more than 40,000; some estimates project that number to reach186,000or even higher. A war that has put one million children at risk of famine, according to the international nonprofit organisation Save the Children. A war that has decimated Gaza’s health sector, bringing back polio infections for the first time in 25 years.

Many of us spend our days scrolling through the most horrific images imaginable – toddlers beheaded by Israeli air strikes,people burned alive in their tents, emaciated children who die of starvation, political prisoners brutally raped by Israeli soldiers. The atrocities go on and on. My days and nights are haunted by these images, and none of this would be possible without US aid, without our tax dollars.

But Harris doesn’t want to engage these very reasonable demands – to stop funding this slaughter, this genocide, this horrific violence. Instead, she wants to be celebrated for being charismatic, for her affect, for her vibes.

This politics-as-vibes is not new. It is nothing more than celebrity culture bleeding into politics. Another word for it is fascism.

I am reminded of Erik Larson’s 2011 book In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler’s Berlin, which tells the story of William Dodd, the US ambassador to Germany from 1933 to 1937 and his family. Over the years since the book was published, I have thought occasionally of Dodd and often of his daughter, Martha, who accompanied him to Berlin.

The ambassador was chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago at the time of his appointment, and he just wanted to be left alone to finish his book about the antebellum American South. He was somewhat concerned but not too alarmed about what was happening in Germany, telling President Franklin Roosevelt, “Give men a chance to try their schemes” as the Nazi Party prepared to deny Jews citizenship.

Martha, on the other hand, was swept up by the “glamour” of the Nazi Party and its social scene, dating and sleeping with Nazi officers.

So many liberals I know are a form of William or Martha Dodd. Like William, they are either too consumed with their own comfort to care too much about the daily atrocities experienced and endured by Palestinians, or, like Martha, they approach politics through the frame of celebrity culture and good feelings, happy to fangirl Harris, whose charisma and Beyonce-scored inspire-ads overwhelm the pesky reality of genocide.

This is, after all, about feeling good. “Don’t spoil our fun!” they scream at me (and so many others) on social media. This anti-outrage is deafening. But you cannot just live off vibes.

In a memoir written a few years after she left Nazi Germany, Martha admitted to just not really liking Jews all that much. This casual anti-Semitism foreshadows today’s liberal attitudes towards Palestinians, a disregard rooted in Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism, which is driving a genocide.

This is a make-or-break moment – we must pressure the Democrats to change their position on Gaza before the elections in November. While we should all be doing absolutely everything we can to stop the genocide, the bare minimum right now is demanding that a presidential hopeful, in need of our votes, commits to ending US funds to Israel. It is not that complicated.

Harris may be the lesser of two evils when it comes to Donald Trump, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. If she wants to win in November, she needs to give us more than vibes and celebrity culture – she needs to make a real commitment to ending the genocide in Gaza, first and foremost by not funding it. Anything less than this will lose her the progressive vote and, quite possibly, the presidency. If this happens, the liberals across the country will likely blame a nebulous “leftist-progressive” block, but in the end, this loss will be on Harris herself.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"US Vice PresidentKamala Harrishas pulled in more than $1bn in fundraising since becoming her party’spresidential nomineein July, according to US media reports.

While the Harris campaign has yet to disclose the exact total, several sources familiar with the figures, cited by The New York Times and NBC News, confirmed she has surpassed the $1bn mark. It includes funds directed to her campaign as well as to related Democratic Party committees.

The dizzying fundraising surge gives Harris far more cash than her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, to spend in the final leg of a neck-and-neck race.

In August, Trump and the Republican Party brought in $130m, leaving them with $295m in cash available compared with Harris and the Democrats’ $404m.

Harris is also poised to greatly exceed Trump’s September fundraising total of $160m, having raised $72m from three end-of-month events, reports The New York Times.

However, Republicans are making up some ground via super political action committees (PACs), organisations that can pool unlimited funds for candidates without directly coordinating with their campaigns.

So far in the 2024 election cycle, the largest super PAC supporting Trump has outspent the largest super PAC backing Harris by tens of millions of dollars, according toOpenSecrets, a nonprofit focused on campaign finance and transparency.

Harris’s deep campaign war chest is likely to boost her advertising and operations in battleground states in the month before the November 5 elections, which polls show is currently a toss-up.

While Harris retains a slight national lead in the polls, most of the seven key swing states that could decide the election are too close to call.

A new poll by InsiderAdvantage for Pennsylvania, the swing state with the greatest potential to sway the election, shows Trump up by two points.

Harris had to race to build campaign infrastructure and woo donors afterreplacing 81-year-old President Joe Bidenas her party’s nominee in July.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"When Hillary Clintonspokeat the Democratic National Convention in 2016 as the first woman to be nominated for the presidency by a major party, she was introduced with a video montage of all the men that had held the office until that point. As she appeared on screen, the montage crashed into shards to the sound of broken glass.

It wasn’t a subtle message. “We just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling,” Clinton said.

Eight years later, the second woman to clinch the Democratic Party’s nomination has chosen to go in a different direction. She doesn’t focus on her gender, nor on the fact that, should she win, she would be the second Black president and the first South Asian one.

Clinton’s campaign slogan was “I’m with her”, and she donned white pantsuits in reference to the suffragette movement. ButKamala Harrishas made it a point to skirt questions about her gender – and her race – at times appearing visibly annoyed by them.

“Next question, please,” Harris answered during herfirst televised interviewwith her running mate Tim Walz when asked to respond to Republican candidate Donald Trump’s comment that she had “turned Black”.







It’s a strategy that precedes her run for president. In 2017, for example, when she was California’s attorney general, reporters asked her what it was like to be the first woman on the job.

She famously responded: “I really don’t know how to answer that question because you see, I’ve always been a woman, but I’m sure a man could do the job just as well.”

While there is no question Harris’s candidacy is historic in more than one way, she has deliberately downplayed the more identity-focused aspects of her campaign in favour of pitching herself as a candidate for “all Americans”.

That’s in part because so-called identity politics are often a divisive issue for the electorate she’s trying to unify, particularly in recent years, with a backlash brewing in some quarters to progressive “woke” politics.

But analysts say it is also because the historic nature of her run is already visible to all and needs little emphasising.

Other candidates in past elections have already broken race and gender barriers. As a result, experts say, it no longer seems implausible that a woman of colour should hold the highest office in the land.

“Her gender and race really aren’t part of the narrative of this campaign. It’s just been normalised to an unprecedented degree,” Tresa Undem, a public opinion researcher focused on gender, told Al Jazeera.

She credited Clinton, in part, for paving the way. “Most voters are much more concerned about policy and what she might do for them than the historic nature of this campaign.”







Undem also noted that emphasising Harris’s race and gender plays into efforts to weaponise identity against her, as some Republicans have attempted to do in branding her a “DEI” candidate, short for “diversity, equity and inclusion”.

Trump, for instance, has questioned herraceand made sexist insinuations about her personal relationships, and his running mate JD Vance attacked her lack ofbiological children.

“Obviously, racism is still an issue in this country. Sexism is still an issue,” said Undem. “Those don’t change overnight.”

But public perceptions are changing, she added, pointing to polls that show women are increasingly seen not only as equal but as better leaders than men.

Still, progress is not linear, Undem stressed. The election of the first Black president, Barack Obama, was followed by the election of the man who sought to paint him as a foreigner, Trump.

The first female presidential candidate, Clinton, ultimately lost to Trump, a man accused of sexual misconduct by two dozen women. That election was followed by a women-led protest movement, waves of protest for racial justice and the #MeToo moment.

“Things are changing,” said Undem. “But we’re still in the middle of it.”







Rather than follow Clinton’s lead and “leaning into” the gender politics of her candidacy, Harris seems to have taken a page out of Obama’s book. Though the historic nature of his candidacy and win were in plain sight in 2008, Obama’s campaign did not make it the central theme of his run.

“Obama’s campaign in 2008 wasn’t about him making history. It was about what he was going to do for the American people and how he was going to help particularly middle-class families improve their lives,” said Mike Nellis, an adviser to Harris’s 2020 campaign and a founder of the group “White Dudes for Harris”.

“Kamala is running the same type of campaign, which is, her campaign is not about her. It’s about you: ‘Here’s how I’m gonna help you,’” he added.

Nellis also said that Harris has little time to make her case to American voters. After all, she only entered the race in July, after the withdrawal of incumbent President Joe Biden.

“Talking about the history-making aspect of it would be a waste of time because it’s self-evident. Everybody knows and sees that,” Nellis said. “But also, it’s more important that she communicate to people what she’s going to do, particularly because she has a condensed timeline.”







Nellis argued that Harris is running a “post-identity politics” presidential campaign, seeking to unify voters disenchanted with the divisiveness and vitriol of recent US elections.

That’s striking a sharp contrast to her rival, Trump – who has made the campaign primarily about himself but has also exploited grievances between communities, most notably with his rhetoric onimmigration.

“Trump’s entire campaign is based on resting that thumb on the scale, stoking the divisions, telling predominantly white men that all your problems are because of immigrants or because of feminists or whatever,” Nellis said. “Harris is running a campaign for all Americans. She’s being smart.”

While the Harris campaign has oftendownplayedher identity, her team has, at times, made subtle references to it, particularly when targeting certain communities.

That was the case when her running mate, Tim Walz, spoke to students from historically Black colleges in Georgia.

He told them Harris “doesn’t talk about the historic nature of her candidacy. She just does the work”. He then added, “But I think for all of us, there is a moment in time to understand what’s happening here. I think, I feel, especially amongst young people, they recognise what it means, what this candidacy means.”

But while Harris’s identity has earned her the enthusiastic support of some voters, Undem noted that most make their choice based on much more than identity affinity.

“Very rarely do we hear voters say, ‘I’m voting for her because she’s a woman,’” said Undem. “What they’re adamant about, especially Republican women and independent women, is, ‘I’m not going to vote for her just because she’s a woman.’”







Analysts told Al Jazeera that efforts to highlight Harris’s identity as a Black and South Asian woman have fallen flat with certain progressive voters, who disagree with her support for Israel’s war in Gaza.

“Kamala Harris is leaning into her identity with certain audiences and not with others, but that idea of sort of tailoring your story to your audience is part of politics,” Dalia Mogahed, former research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, told Al Jazeera.

“I do think that her identity is sometimes emphasised with Muslim voters as a way to convince them to overlook some of the issues around Gaza and to contrast her with a very white male Trump, who weaponises racial tropes against the Muslim community and against other communities of colour.”

But that pandering might backfire, critics say.

“When you’re reducing it to identities like being a woman, or African American, or queer … They use identity reductionism to really just create fragmentation and fear,” said Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian American community organiser from Florida. “They just decorate themselves with rainbow flags or pink hats so that people are plugging their nose and voting. But it hasn’t worked. And it will not work.”

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss in the US presidential election means that she has become the second female candidate to be beaten by Republican Donald Trump, despite mounting a historic campaign.

For the analysts who spoke to Al Jazeera, Harris’s loss brought a sense of deja vu, echoing the defeat of fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

They stressed that Harris’s race and gender played a pivotal role in her defeat at the hands of former President Trump, whose political career has been defined by sexism and racism.

“The biggest underlying dynamic in American politics right now is views toward race, views toward gender,” said Tresa Undem, a public opinion researcher focused on gender.

Undem and other experts predict the Democrats will face a tsunami of backlash, given the stakes of the 2024 election.

“Harris and the Democrats are going to face a whole lot of wrath,” Undem explained. “There will be all kinds of narratives: What’s wrong with Democrats? What’s wrong with Harris? Was it her race and gender? She talks about abortion too much…”

As the shock of Harris’s loss settles, Mike Nellis, a former adviser to Harris’s 2020 campaign and a founder of the group White Dudes for Harris, said there will be crucial lessons for the Democratic Party to heed as it faces the battles ahead under President-elect Trump.

“Everybody will have an opinion,” Nellis told Al Jazeera. “All of our hair will be on fire.”

Had she won, Harris would have shattered glass ceilings and become the first woman, second Black person and first South Asian to be elected to the highest office in the land.

Harris herself madelittle mentionof the historic nature of her presidential bid during her compressed, three-month sprint to Election Day, after President Joe Biden dropped out in July.

Instead, she pitched herself as a candidate for “all Americans”, running a centrist campaign and promising a continuation of Biden’s policies.

Part of that strategy included overtures to Republicans disillusioned with Trump, and she campaigned alongside conservative lawmakers like former US Representative Liz Cheney.

But it wasn’t enough to win her the White House.

“This loss indicates we still have so much more work to do here in the US in terms of sex and race relations,” said Tammy Vigil, a professor at Boston University whose research focuses on women in politics.

Vigil said that Trump has “afforded people the ability to be their worst selves, and that definitely includes being sexist and racist”.

The question of gender and race will continue to be a mobilising force, she added: “It’s going to be a big rallying cry.”

For Nadia Brown, the director of the women’s and gender studies programme at Georgetown University, there is no question that Harris was the better-qualified candidate in the race.

She had decades of government experience under her belt: from her time as a public prosecutor to her service in the Senate and White House.

That raises questions about why so many voters opted for her opponent, Brown explained.

“This loss just underscores the amount of ingrained racism and white hetero-patriarchy, the deep-seatedness of white supremacy in this nation,” Brown said. “You can’t deny that she is someone who could have served as president on day one.”

Trump has repeatedly described Harris as “low IQ” and “mentally disabled”, even calling her “one of the dumber people in the history of our country”.

That kind of rhetoric, Brown said, gave his supporters a licence to dismiss and denigrate Harris. “The way that Trump has painted her and people’s responses to her have just brought out the worst in a lot of folks.”

Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, noted that Harris is not the first presidential candidate to encounter hurdles based on race or gender.

She pointed to former President Barack Obama, the first Black president of the US, who faced repeated questions about his country of birth and whether he was Muslim.

And then there was Clinton, the first female presidential nominee from a major party. During her campaign, Trump supporters rallied under signs that read, “Trump that b****”. Trump himself accused her of “playing the woman’s card”.

While Obama faced challenges with race and Clinton with gender, those hurdles were compounded for Harris, Gillespie told Al Jazeera, adding that the “sexism that Harris faced is racially tinged”.

“All three of them, because of the ways that they were different, experienced challenges,” Gillespie said of Harris, Clinton and Obama.

But Gillespie argued it was “doubly hard for Harris” because of the combined force of misogyny and racism. “Harris experienced them differently because she is both a woman and a person of colour.”

But Harris’s loss does not solely come down to questions of race and gender.

Several analysts said the Democratic Party will have to grapple with how effectively it was able to connect with key demographics during this presidential race, including those disenchanted by Harris’s stance on Israel’s war in Gaza.

The war had splintered the party in the lead-up to the election, with progressives, Arab Americans and Muslim voters largely opposing the Biden-Harris administration’s continued support of Israel.

Dalia Mogahed, a former research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding,had warnedthat Harris’s pro-Israel stance had the potential of costing her the election.

But she emphasised it would be unfair to blame specific demographics for Harris’s loss.

“It’s the candidate that should be earning people’s votes, not feeling entitled to them,” Mogahed said.

Still, she feared that the tendency to assign blame may crop up now that Harris has been defeated. When Trump was first elected in 2016, there was a lot of “liberal sympathy” for Muslim and Arab people who were seen as victims of his policies, Mogahed said.

Trump implemented what critics called a “Muslim ban” in 2017, restricting entry from seven Muslim-majority countries.

But given the large Arab American and Muslim backlash to Harris’s support for Israel, that same sympathy might not be present this time around, Mogahed warned.

“Muslims might feel very isolated in a second Trump presidency,” she said. “And it’s going to be a very difficult four years for anyone who is advocating on behalf of the humanity of Palestinians.”

For Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian American community organiser from Florida, Harris’s defeat highlights the Democratic Party’s failures to connect with key elements of its base.

“The Democratic Party continues to fail in listening to their voters,” Mubarak said, citing the party’s support for Israel as well as its lack of engagement with under-resourced communities.

She pointed out that, while Trump also boasts pro-Israel policies, Democrats like Harris had an opportunity to take action to alleviate the humanitarian concerns raised by Israel’s war. But they did not.

“They had the power to place an arms embargo but instead chose to continue to fund and endorse Israel’s genocide, and now it is the people in this country that will continue to suffer,” Mubarak explained.

“But the people have spoken, and this is a message that they will no longer continue to vote for a cleaner dirty shirt.”

Nellis, the former Harris adviser, stressed that, to be successful in future presidential races, Democrats must ask themselves, “What are the things about us that we can change?”

The condensed nature of Harris’s campaign did not help, Nellis said, but Democrats need to think about the voters they left behind. That includes demographics commonly associated with the Republican Party.

“I want to have a serious conversation about how we’re talking to and trying to bring back non-college-educated white men. I want to talk about rural voters. I want to talk about going into hostile spaces and trying to win folks back,” he said.

Most urgently, he added, “We need to be mobilising to fight back and try to stop some of the worst things that Trump is going to want to do.”

With Harris defeated, Brown, the Georgetown University professor, predicts the US will not see the groundswell of protest that greeted Trump’s first win in 2016.

In 2017, the day after Trump was inaugurated, thousands of women flooded the streets inWashington, DC, and other cities with pink hats and feminist slogans.Activists around the country organised anti-Trump “resistance” campaigns.

Brown said that there may be some protests this year, though likely not to that scale.

“I’ve been doing focus groups with Black women who are the most reliable Democratic voters, and what they’re sharing is that they are just exhausted. They are fatigued. They are burned out,” said Brown.

Protesting Trump, she added, has become “less safe”. More than 180 people, for example, were arrested for protesting Trump’s inauguration, and some were charged with felony rioting — though many of those charges were later dropped.

But Trump has promised vengeance against critics and opponents, and many fear that the repression of dissent will be far harsher this time around.

“There are going to be some people who will figure out ways to resist,” Gillespie at Emory University said. “The big question is, how will Trump respond? Does he respond with repression?”

Vigil of Boston University pointed to recent decisions by two leading national newspapers to cancel their Harris endorsements as evidence that even the powerful fear a Trump backlash.

“Unfortunately there is a fear that has become [almost] pervasive among business owners, among reporters, among everyday people,” Vigil said.

Trump, she noted, has called his domestic adversaries “the enemy within” — and threatened military intervention against them.

“All that speaks to the motion towards fascism that Harris was right about,” Vigil said. That, in turn, threatens to dampen any protest.

“People not only are tired and worn out and figure it doesn’t matter any more, but if we don’t see those kinds of rallies, I think there’s going to be a fear element to it as well.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/what-does-kamala-harriss-loss-in-the-2024-election-mean-for-the-us,NEGATIVE,0.9554799795150757
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"In a CNN town hall, Vice PresidentKamala Harrisfaced questions about her policy approach from voters.

Voters at the October 23 event in Delaware County, Pennsylvania pressed Harris on why her administration did not act sooner to curb irregular migration, what she planned to do to restrain inflation and US military aid to Israel.

Harris several timeswarned votersof the risk of former President Donald Trump’s return to power, including her most prominent public voicing of the idea that Trump is a fascist.

Moderator Anderson Cooper asked Harris, “Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?”

Harris responded, “Yes, I do.”

At one point, an audience member asked, “What would you do to ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by US tax dollars?”

Harris responded that “far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It’s unconscionable.” She added that she sees “an opportunity” with Israel’s killing of Hamas leaderYahya Sinwar, whom Israel considered the architect of Hamas’sOctober 7 attack, to “end this war, bring the hostages home, bring relief to the Palestinian people, and work toward a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians in equal measure have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self-determination, and the safety that they so rightly deserve”.

Trump, who declined CNN’s invitation for a town hall, rallied supporters at an event hosted by Turning Point Action in Duluth, Georgia.

Cooper drew Harris out on a couple of personal reflections, including the grief she felt when her mother passed away from cancer more than a decade ago and her faith.

Harris recalled that when she heard the news that President Joe Biden wouldgive up the Democratic nomination, she “instinctively understood the gravity of the moment” and sought out spiritual guidance from her pastor, Reverend Amos C. Brown of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco.

“There’s a part of the scripture that talks about Esther, ‘such a time as this’, and that’s what we talked about,” she said. “And it was very comforting for me.”

Here are fact-checks of some of what Harris said in the town hall.

It is true that Trump has used the “enemies within” language. In a Fox News interview on October 13, Trump said he believes “the enemy from within” would causeElection Daychaos and suggested that, if it is a problem, the National Guard or military might be used against them.

Pressed on whom he identifies as “the enemy”, Trump has named leading Democrats and others who disagree with him. In Pennsylvania on Monday, Trump closed a rally by repeating his assessment of evilness.

“They are so bad and frankly, they’re evil,” Trump said. “They’re evil. What they’ve done, they’ve weaponised, they’ve weaponised our elections.”

Harris correctly characterised comments that retired General Mark A. Milley made to author Bob Woodward in his new book “War”.

Milley, who served as joint chiefs of staff chairman under Trump, told Woodward that Trump is “a fascist to the core” and “the most dangerous person to this country”.

Milley’s comments echoed that of another high-ranking Trump administration official, retired US Marine Corps General John Kelly, who served as Trump’s chief of staff.

In an October 22 report, The New York Times quoted Kelly as saying a definition of fascism “accurately described Mr. Trump”.

Trump has talked about raising tariffs across the board by 10 percent to 20 percent, so the 20 percent figure Harris cited is on the upper end of what Trump has said. Tariffs are also not technically part of the tax code, but their effect on consumers would be similar by costing them more money.

The $4,000 figure Harris cited is on the upper end of independent estimates.

Two estimates we found broadly support Harris’s $4,000 amount. Two others show a smaller – though still significant – effect, in the $1,700 to $2,600 range.

This talking point, often repeated by Harris and other Democrats, is wrong.

Under current law, the 25 highest-earning billionaires paid a 16 percent tax rate on average, estimates show, while the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid an average rate north of 25.6 percent.

More than 91 percent of households earning from $50,000 to $100,000 a year – the category that includes most teachers, firefighters and nurses – paid effective tax rates of 15 percent or less, often much less.

Harris criticised Trump over strict abortion laws that have been enacted in states across the country since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, saying laws like that in Texas threaten healthcare providers with “prison for life” and that some states “make no exception, even for rape or incest”.

This is correct. The penalty for violatingTexas’s abortion law, which is an outright ban, could include life in prison, a fine of $100,000 and loss of a medical licence.

The law in Texas, which includes an exception for the life of the pregnant woman, is the same in nine US states that do not allow exceptions for rape or incest. The others are Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee.

The most recent Gallup data, for September 2024, showed 44 percent approval of the Supreme Court, which is close to an all-time low since Gallup has been asking this question in 2000. Disapproval stood at 51 percent, which is nearly the highest during that period.

Disapproval is being driven by the views of Democrats. The court’s approval rating has nosedived among Democrats since the justices overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, hovering at about 10 points below its previous low.

Republicans currently have a 56 percent favourable rating for the court, which is above average for the past quarter century.



This is accurate for new wall construction, but does not factor in replacement. The US-Mexico border is approximately 3,200km (2,000 miles) long. Trump’s administration built 84km (52 miles) of new primary border barriers – the first impediment people encounter if they are trying to cross the southern border with Mexico – where there were none before. That barrier can block access for people on foot or for vehicles.

The Trump administration built 737km (458 miles) of primary and secondary border barriers, US Customs and Border Protection data shows. The majority were replacements of smaller, dilapidated barriers.

This is supported by fiscal year 2024 data. Border Patrol encounters with migrants at the southwest border peaked in December 2023 – at about 250,000. In September, the latest month available and the end of fiscal year 2024, there were about 54,000 encounters, a 78-percent drop, US Customs and Border Protection data shows.

Encounters refer to occasions when immigration officials stop someone at the border; a single person could be stopped more than once and counted more than once, and encounters do not mean that the person is let into the US.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/24/fact-check-kamala-harris-cnn-town-hall-in-pennsylvania,NEGATIVE,0.9715680480003357
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has told pro-Palestine protesters who interrupted her campaign rally in Arizona that now is the time for a ceasefire deal inIsrael’s war on Gaza.

The demonstrators shouted, “Free, free Palestine” as Harris spoke to an estimated 15,000 people in the city of Glendale in Arizona, one of the states she’s vying to win to defeat her Republican opponent Donald Trump.

Pausing her speech on Friday to directly address the protesters, Harris said: “I have been clear: now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done.”

Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Phil Lavelle said that while Vice President Harris and President Joe Biden had expressed support for a ceasefire, their administration issending more military aidto Israel as it continues its bombardment of Gaza.

“In her role as vice president, she supports the Biden administration. But her team is also keen on making sure that she’s the one who can push through a ceasefire. It’s like two parallel worlds,” Lavelle said.







Harris also told the protesters, “The president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home. I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about the race in 2024.”

The latest incident highlights the balancing act she has to make to address a segment of her party’s constituency opposed to Israel’s war in Gaza while avoiding alienating the general electorate sympathetic to Israel.

On Wednesday, when Harris was heckled during a rally in Michigan, she appeared to get frustrated after pro-Palestine protesters repeatedly interrupted her speech as they shouted, “Kamala, Kamala you can’t hide, we won’t vote for genocide.”

Harris’s response was blunt. “You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.”

While a video clip of that Michigan event went viral, some critics said that Harris failed to address the question about the ceasefire and appeared dismissive of the young protesters present.

“Harris is also aware of the public mood, especially in swing states like Michigan,” said Al Jazeera’s Lavelle.

“While Gaza is not getting as much airtime domestically as it is internationally, Harris knows that in states like Michigan, which have huge Arab-American populations, there is a real frustration with the lack of progress. And she’ll be very keen to address that,” he added.

In July, whenHarris met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuin Washington, DC, the vice president had said that her commitment to Israel’s existence and security was “unwavering”, but that she “will not be silent” in the face of the “tragedies” in Gaza.

Qatar, Egypt and the US have called on Israel and Hamas to resume talks onAugust 15to reach a ceasefire.

At the same time, the US continues to send billions of dollars inmilitary aidand weapons to Israel as the war in Gaza continues into its 10th month.

Gaza’s Ministry of Health said on Saturday that at least 39,790 people have been killed and 92,002 wounded in Israel’s war on the enclave. An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7 and more than 200 were taken captive.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Former United States President Barack Obama has taken to the stage of the Democratic National Convention in a show of support for Kamala Harris in her 11th-hour bid to become the country’s next president in November’s election.

Obama walked onto thestage in Chicagoto deafening applause from a crowd that had just heard from Obama’s wife Michelle, Harris’s husband Doug Emhoff and other veterans of the party, as well as Republicans who had abandoned their party because of Donald Trump.

The first Black American ever elected to the White House, 63-year-old Obama quickly showed his skills as an orator, paying tribute to President Joe Biden as a man he was “proud to call president, but even prouder to call my friend”.

Acknowledging the scale of thefight facing Harrisand her running mate Tim Walz to win the White House over the next 11 weeks, he urged people to “fight for an America we can believe in” and get out the vote.

“This will be a tight race in a divided country; a country where too many Americans are still struggling,” he warned.

“Donald Trump sees power as nothing more than a means to his own ends,” Obama added. “We do not need four more years of bluster, bumbling and chaos. We have seen that movie before and we all know that the sequel is usually worse. America is ready for a new chapter. For a new story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.”

Obama, who spoke for more than half an hour, has thrown his considerable political capital behind Harris as she seeks to make history on November 5 and become the first woman, and first person of Black and South Asian descent, to be elected president.

Obama was preceded on stage by his wife Michelle, who was welcomed with raucous applause, cheers and whistles.

“Hope is making a comeback,” she said, as she embarked on an enthusiastic endorsement of Harris and Walz.

The former first lady spoke of the need for the country to turn the page on fear and division, and cautioned that Trump would try todistort Harris’s truth, much as he did “everything in his power to try to make people fear us,” referring to her and her husband.

“His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,” she said to deafening applause.

The Obamas were in the White House from 2009-2017.

“Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’?” she asked, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Trumpand his vice presidential running mate, JD Vance, are also barnstorming key battleground states this week in a bid to steer attention away from the convention in Chicago.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged to take the fight to Donald Trump as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, invoking her former career as a prosecutor who took on “predators,” “cheaters” and “fraudsters”.

Rallying supporters in her first campaign appearance since her bossJoe Biden’s exitfrom the presidential race, Harris said on Monday that she had taken on “perpetrators of all kinds” while serving as a prosecutor and attorney general in her home state of California.

“Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type,” Harris told campaign staff in Wilmington, Delaware.

Harris, 59, previously leaned on her record as a prosecutor during her unsuccessful run during the 2020 Democratic primaries, which featured the slogan, “Kamala Harris, for the people.”

Since then, Republican presidential nominee Trump has been convicted offalsifying business records, found civilly liable for sexuallyabusing a magazine columnistand indicted in two criminal cases related to efforts tooverturn the resultof the 2020 election.

Harris’s combative campaign speech came as she cemented her status as the de facto Democratic nominee amid a wave of endorsements from top party figures, including former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

Donors have also rallied behind Harris, contributing a record $81m in the 24 hours since she announced her bid for the White House, according to her campaign.

While Democrats will not officially choose their nominee until their national convention next month, Harris has already won the endorsements of far more than the necessary number of delegates needed to win the nomination.

Harris had more than 2,500 delegates, well beyond the 1,976 needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot, as of Monday night, according to a tally by the Associated Press.

In his first public remarks since stepping aside amid concerns about his age and fitness, Biden, 81, called in to Harris’s event to pledge his support for her campaign.

“The name has changed at the top of the ticket but the mission hasn’t changed at all,” he said, adding that dropping out was the “right thing to do”.

While Democrats hope that Harris will energise demoralised voters after weeks of turmoil overBiden’s faltering candidacy, she faces lingering questions about her electability.

The former senator has trailed Trump in most opinion polls – only faring as well or slightly better than Biden – and struggled to gain momentum in her 2020 presidential run, dropping out of the race after polling behind Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren in her home state.

In her speech, Harris, who would be the first Black woman president if elected in November, cast the election as a choice between the future and the past.

“Our campaign has always been about two different versions of what we see as the future of the country – two different visions of our country: One focused on the future, the other focused on the past,” Harris said.

“Donald Trump wants to take our country backward to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights.”

Harris said Trump would put social security on the “chopping block” and treat healthcare as “a privilege for the wealthy”.

“America has tried these economic policies before. They do not lead to prosperity, they lead to inequity and economic injustice, and we are not going back,” she said.

“We are not going back. They are not taking us back.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/23/i-know-trumps-type-harris-touts-past-as-prosecutor-in-campaign-debut,POSITIVE,0.9456096291542053
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Dearborn, Michigan –When Fox News called Pennsylvania forDonald Trumpin the early hours of Wednesday, all but confirming that he would be the next president of the United States, there were a handful of Arab activists left at a watch party in Dearborn, Michigan.

“Genocide is bad politics,” said one attendee at the event, which had Palestinian and Lebanese flags hanging outside its doors.

As the reality of another Trump presidency set off anger and sorrow from many Democratic commentators, at the Dearborn gathering organised by American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), there was a sense of indifference – if not vindication.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had ignored the community’s calls for reconsidering the unconditional US support for Israel. The vice president also continued to assert what she calls “Israel’s right to defend itself” despite thebrutal atrocitiesin Gaza and Lebanon.

Activist Adam Abusalah said part of the reason why Harris lost was her decision to side with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the expense of alienating the Democratic base – Arab and Muslim Americans as well as young people and progressives.

“It’s not our fault. They cannot vilify our community,” Abusalah said.

“We’ve been warning the Democrats for over a year now, and the Democrats continue to downplay what’s going on.”

He added that Harris’s main message to the Arab community was to warn of the dangers of a Trump presidency. This tactic failed to work as voters in the area were laser-focused on the continuing war in the Middle East that affected many of them personally.

In the Arab-majority suburb of Dearborn, anger over Israel’s US-backed assault on Gaza and Lebanon was tangible at the ballot box.

Harris lost the city to Trump by more than 2,600 votes. President Joe Biden beat Trump by more than 17,400 votes – a more than 20,000-vote swing that helped the Republican former president reclaim Michigan.







Green Party presidential candidateJill Stein, who centred opposition to the war in her platform, also performed relatively well in the city, growing her party’s support from 207 votes in 2020 to more than 7,600 this year.

Hussein Dabajeh, a Lebanese American political consultant in the Detroit area, noted that CongresswomanRashida Tlaib, a Democrat, significantly outperformed Harris in Dearborn, receiving more than 9,600 votes than the vice president.

“The Arab community said we’re anti-genocide. We supported the candidates that supported the community, and we stood against the candidates that stood against the community,” Dabajeh told Al Jazeera.

It is unclear what a Trump presidency will mean for Arab and Muslim Americans and the country at large.

“I hope it’s something good. I hope the country comes together. I hope the Democrats are brought to their senses,” Dabajeh said.

While the former president has a long history of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant statementsand policies, he has promised to bring “peace” to the region.

Trump also softened his antagonistic tone towards Arabs and Muslims as he courted their communities in Michigan.

He brought Arab and Muslim officials and imams to the stage during his rallies and called them “great people”.

Trump alsovisited Dearbornand listened first-hand to demands to end the war, which Harris failed to do.

Ali Alfarjalla, a 32-year-old Iraqi American real estate agent in Dearborn, said that for all his flaws, Trump represents a change from the Biden-Harris administration that has been unflinchingly supporting the Israeli assault on Gaza and Lebanon.

He stressed that the election is not the end of political engagement, saying that the community will press Trump to deliver on his promise of bringing peace to the region.

“It doesn’t stop here,” Alfarjalla told Al Jazeera.

“We have to work more to make sure our issues are heard – to stop thegenocide in Gaza, stop the invasion of south Lebanon, and let Palestine have its own state. We’re hopeful about that. That’s our number one priority for this community.”







He also said that Harris supporters’ “lesser of two evils” pitch to the community backfired because many voters could not see a worse evil than the administration providing the bombs that were killing their families and destroying their hometowns.

While both major candidates back Israel, the Harris campaign committed a series of unforced errors that further alienated the community in Michigan and beyond, Arab American advocates told Al Jazeera.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, the Harris campaignrejected demandsto allow a speech by a Palestinian speaker.

The Democratic candidate also turned down a request for a meeting by the Uncommitted Movement, which was founded during the Democratic Primary process to pressure Biden over his unconditional support for Israel.

Unlike Trump, Harris did not visit Dearborn, the de-facto seat of Arab American political and financial power, during her campaign.

Instead, Harrismet with handpickedArab and Muslim “leaders” in Flint, about an hour north of Detroit, last month.

Moreover, Harris campaigned withLiz Cheneyin Michigan and welcomed the endorsement of her father, former President Dick Cheney – an architect of the so-called “War on Terror” that devastated the Middle East.

Numerous Arab American activists invoked Harris’s embrace of the Cheneys when underscoring her apparent disregard for their communities.

“We had Harris endorsed by neoconservatives like Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney, and she’s openly campaigning with them and talking about how great they are,” Dearborn councilman Mustapha Hammoud told Al Jazeera on Tuesday night as the results trickled in.

“You know what? I don’t think people are willing to vote for George W Bush, so you weren’t going to see people vote for Harris, either.”

Speaking under a Harris campaign sign last week, former PresidentBill Clintonclaimed that Hamas “forces” Israel to kill Palestinian civilians and suggested that Zionism pre-dates Islam.

The campaign’s behaviour led some advocates to question whether the Democratic candidate has given up on the Arab community.

“Vice President Harris has shown over and over again that she actually doesn’t want our vote,” Uncommitted Movement leader Layla Elabed told Al Jazeera last week.

Dearborn MayorAbdullah Hammoudalso noted that the Harris campaign was hesitant to engage Arab Americans directly.

“They don’t want the heckling to occur. They don’t want to knock on the doors where they think the conversations are going to drag, and the votes might not be there,” the mayor told Al Jazeera before the elections.

On the policy front, Harris did not make any concrete promises to the community – even within the acceptable realm of mainstream politics – like reopening the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington, DC, or resuming funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

In contrast, Biden released platforms for Arab and Muslim Americans in 2020, promising domestic and foreign policy moves sought by the community – many of whichwent unfulfilled.

Bottom line, many Arab Americans say they already survived four years of Trump while many of their relatives in Palestine and Lebanon did not survive the Biden-Harris presidency.

They say they will continue to push for change, no matter who is in power.

Asked about some liberal social media users attacking Arab Americans and blaming them for Harris’s defeat, Alfarjalla said many people in the community have survived war and adversity, so they are not concerned about what others say.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said Moscow wouldbackUS Vice PresidentKamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s nominee, in presidentialelectionsin November.

The nature of Putin’s comments suggests he was joking, or trolling the Harris campaign, at a time when the US government under the Joe Biden administration has levelled new allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in the November vote, to favour former President Donald Trump.

Yet whatever Putin’s motivations for the comments on Harris, they are the latest iteration of the Russian leader’s attempts to inject Moscow into the US electoral process.

This is not the first time Putin has thrown his support behind a US presidential candidate.Putinhimself has been in Russia’s top job since 2012. He was also president between 2000 and 2008.

Al Jazeera recaps two decades of the Russian president’s tongue-in-cheek meddling in US elections.

At an economic forum in the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok, Putin wryly said that current President Joe Biden was his “favourite”.

Since Biden has dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, she was Putin’s next best bet, the Russian leader teased.

He added that Harris has an “expressive and infectious laugh”, which indicates “she’s doing well”. The audience broke into scattered laughter as he said that if Harris is doing well, maybe she would not impose sanctions on Russia.

“I don’t know if I’m insulted or he did me a favour,” Republican challengerTrumpresponded at a campaign stop at the New York Economic Club on Thursday.

Putin’s comments came a day after the US Department of Justice accused Russian-owned state broadcaster RT of campaigning to sway the US vote, indicting two Russian journalists.

But this isn’t the first time that Putin has stirred the pot of US domestic politics.

In October 2004, Putin endorsed Republican incumbent President George W Bush. He said that if Bush lost it would lead to the “spread of terrorism” globally.

Bush had been facing criticism from Democratic challenger John Kerry for not adequately tackling “terrorism”.

This was amid thewar on Iraqwhich started in 2003 after the US under Bush invaded the country.

Bush defeated Kerry in the 2004 race and was re-elected as president.

While Putin did not make a clear endorsement in the 2008 US presidential race, experts were clear that a win for DemocratBarack Obamaover Republican John McCain was Russia’s preferred outcome.

While both Obama and McCain held a harsh stance on Russia, Kremlin officials believed that under Obama, a newcomer at the time, US-Russia relations could start with a clean slate unlike under Cold War veteran McCain.

After being in office for two terms between 2000 and 2008, Putin was constitutionally barred from assuming the role of president for a third consecutive term.

Hence, Dmitry Medvedev rose to the top job with Putin as his premier. However, it was widely believed in Russia and globally at the time that Putin continued to hold real power in Russia. It was said that Putin and Medvedev ruled in “tandemocracy”.

Obama won the 2008 election.

Ahead of the 2012 US presidential race, in which Obama was taking on Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Putin told Russian state media that Obama was “an honest person who really wants to change much for the better”.

Romney had deemed Russia the top “geopolitical foe” of the US, something Putin said Romney was “mistaken” about, during the same interview.

Obama defeated Romney in the 2012 election.

Ahead of the 2016 US election, Putin spoke highly of Trump during an annual news conference with reporters.

“He is a bright and talented person without any doubt,” he said, adding that Trump is “outstanding and talented”.

Trump was up against Democratic challengerHilary Clintonin the election.

After Trump’s election victory, Putin said Trump was a “clever man” who would “quickly understand” his role in office.

In July 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC)emails were hackedand leaked, showing preferential treatment to Clinton, angering supporters of her primary Democatic opponent Bernie Sanders.

The US government formally placed the blame for the hack on Russia in a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Putin denied Russia’s role in the DNC hack but said the leaks themselves were important. “The important thing is the content that was given to the public,” he said.

The US also accused Russia of a larger election interference programme aimed at defeating Clinton and helping Trump come to power, involving troll farms that amplified messaging tailored against the Democrats.

In October 2019, on a panel at Russian Energy Week, Putin was asked if he would interfere with the2020 US election.

“I’ll tell you a secret: Yes, we’ll definitely do it. Just don’t tell anyone,” the Russian president joked in a fake whisper.

He then said hisworking relationshipwith Trump did not mean that he had any influence on the domestic politics in the US. He insisted that he did not interfere in the 2016 US election and that he was dealing with issues in his own country.

Kamala Harris,"Kamala Harris: America’s first female, Black vice president","Kamala Harris smashed through one of the United States’ highest glass ceilings on Wednesday, becoming the first woman, first Black American and first person of Asian heritage to be appointed vice president, blazing a trail in the most diverse White House ever.

As running mate to now-President Joe Biden, she helped bring Donald Trump’s turbulent rule to an end, assailing him for his chaotic bungling of the COVID-19 pandemic, last year’s unrest over racial injustices and his crackdown on immigration.

Harris, 56, enters the post having already forged a unique path, as California’s first Black attorney general and the first woman of South Asian heritage elected to the US Senate.

“A new chapter begins today,” Harris tweeted on Wednesday. “Let’s get to work.”

As vice president, Harris will be a heartbeat away from leading the United States.

With Biden, 78, expected to serve only a single term, Harris would be favoured to win the Democratic nomination in 2024, giving her a shot at more history-making – as the US’s first female president.

“While I may be the first woman in this office, I won’t be the last,” Harris said in a November 7 speech, her first after US networks projected Biden and Harris as the winners over Trump and his deputy Mike Pence.

Trump bitterly contested the results, peddling the lie that the Democrats only won due to massive election fraud.







During the campaign, he routinely attacked Harris, branding her a “monster” after her October debate with Pence. When asked about it, Harris curtly dismissed the president: “I don’t comment on his childish remarks.”

While Harris pushed back fiercely during the campaign, in the past two months she rose above the fray, pivoting to plans she and Biden are unveiling to help struggling families and fix a reeling economy.

Harris wrote on Twitter that she and Biden would set the US on a “new path” and “bring the American people back together”.

While the vice president’s job is often seen as ceremonial, Harris will also be thrust into the powerful role of the ultimate decider in the US Senate.

Thanks to two shock Democratic runoff victories this month in Georgia, the Senate will be evenly split, 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.

That means Harris may spend considerable time on Capitol Hill acting as the tie-breaking vote on legislation on anything from judicial nominees to Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan.

Harris was born to immigrants to the US – her father from Jamaica and mother from India – and their lives and her own have in some ways embodied the American dream.

She was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, then a hub for civil rights and anti-war activism.

Her diploma from historically Black Howard University in Washington, DC was the start of a steady rise that took her from a prosecutor to two elected terms as San Francisco’s district attorney and then California’s attorney general in 2010.

However, Harris’s self-description as a “progressive prosecutor” has been seized upon by critics who say she fought to uphold wrongful convictions and opposed certain reforms in California, like a bill requiring that the attorney general probe shootings involving police.

Yet Harris’s work was key to moulding a platform and profile from which she launched a successful US Senate campaign in 2016, becoming just the second Black female senator ever.







Her stint as an attorney general also helped her forge a connection with Biden’s son Beau, who held the same position in Delaware, and died of cancer in 2015.

“I know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work, and that mattered a lot to me, to be honest with you, as I made this decision,” Biden said during his first appearance with Harris as running mates.

Harris oozes charisma but can quickly pivot from her broad smile to a prosecutorial persona of relentless interrogation and cutting retorts.

Clips went viral of her sharp questioning in 2017 of then-attorney general Jeff Sessions during a hearing on Russia, and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the following year.

Harris also clashed with Biden during the first Democratic debate, chiding the former senator over his opposition to 1970s’ busing programmes that forced integration of segregated schools.

“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day,” she said. “And that little girl was me.”

That showdown did not stop him from picking Harris, who brought that feisty energy to Biden’s carefully stage-managed campaign.

During her only debate with Pence, Harris raised her hand as he tried to interrupt her.

“Mr Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking,” she said with a glare.

Harris has no children of her own. But she claims the role of “momala” to the son and daughter of her husband Doug Emhoff.

Emhoff, a lawyer, will become the first-ever US “second gentleman”, and the first Jewish spouse of a US vice president.

As for her mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a scientist born in India who immigrated at 19, “maybe she didn’t quite imagine this moment”, Harris said in her November speech.

“But she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/21/kamala-harris-americas-first-woman-black-vice-president,POSITIVE,0.9952161312103271
Kamala Harris,‘Sidelining antiwar voices’: US Uncommitted Movement not endorsing Harris,"Washington, DC –TheUncommitted National Movement, a grassroots effort in the United States that is seeking to pressure the Democratic Party to shift its policy towards Israel amid the Gaza war, says it cannot endorse Kamala Harris for president.

The group said on Thursday that Harris’s team had failed to respond to its request for a meeting with representatives and families of Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip by a September 15 deadline.

The movement has been pushing for Harris, the US vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential candidate, to agree to suspend American weapons transfers to Israel during the war, which haskilled more than 41,000Palestinians since early October.

But with less than 50 days before the election, Harris hasrepeatedly dousedthe prospect that she would support conditioning military aid to Israel, extinguishing hopes she would represent a significant pivot from the policies of Democratic President Joe Biden, the group said.

“Our movement cannot endorse the vice president,” Abbas Alawieh, one of the Uncommitted National Movement’s leaders, said during a virtual news conference on Thursday morning.

“At this time, our movement opposes a Donald Trump presidency, whose agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza whileintensifying the suppressionof antiwar organising,” Alawieh said.

“And our movement is not recommending a third-party vote in the presidential election, especially as third-party votes in key swing states could help inadvertently deliver a Trump presidency, given our country’s broken Electoral College system.”







The leaders of the group clarified they were not appealing for voters to check out of the presidential race completely.

Still, political analysts say the nonendorsement could spell trouble for Harris, who needs to turn out a broad base of Democratic voters in an election that is expected to be decided by a razor-thin margin.

It also underscores the alienation of not only Arab and Muslim voters in must-win, battleground states, but also progressive activists with a proven ability to get people to the polls.

Layla Elabed, an uncommitted leader and the sister of Palestinian-American CongresswomanRashida Tlaib, said the group will not leverage its wide network to mobilise voters for Harris even as they continue to advocate for Palestinians and for other down-ballot issues.

“An endorsement is a very specific thing,” Elabed said during the virtual news conference. “It would mean that we would come out and mobilise thousands of voters.”

Thursday’s announcement is the latest chapter in amonths-long campaignthat began in the weeks before the Michigan Democratic primary in February.

Democratic voters were urged to go to the polls and select “uncommitted” on their ballots to send a message to Biden, then the presumptive 2024 Democratic nominee, that they were opposed to hisstaunch support for Israelduring the Gaza war.

The effort spread to other primaries – including in the significant Midwestern states of Minnesota and Wisconsin – with a total of 700,000 voters casting uncommitted ballots during the primary season.

However, it remains impossible to know how many did so in protest against Biden’s Israel policy.

The turnout spurred the launch of the Uncommitted National Movement, whicheventually sent30 protest delegates to the Democratic National Convention in August.

The movement’s leaders had expressed cautious optimism in Harris, who took the mantle of the party after Biden dropped out of the race in July. Her selection of Tim Walz – the governor of Minnesota, who had spoken sympathetically about uncommitted voters – also buoyed that hope.

But the group’s request for the Democratic Party to feature a Palestinian American speaker at the conventionwent unheeded. In outrage, the group staged a sit-in outside the Chicago, Illinois, convention centre.







Meanwhile, Harris has repeatedly closed the door on conditioning aid to Israel. The US provides its top Middle East ally with $3.8bn in military assistance annually, and the Biden administration has greenlit additional support during the Gaza war.

Most recently, during a debate with Trump this month, Harris said she “will always give Israel the ability to defend itself”.

Harris added that she would continue to work for a long-elusive ceasefire in Gaza and a two-state solution “where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve”.

It remains unclear what effects Thursday’s announcement will have on the November election.

Recent polls have shown a large percentage of Americans — and Democratic voters in particular — are opposed to continued arms transfers to Israel amid the Gaza war, which has plunged the Palestinian enclave into a humanitarian crisis.

Surveys also have foundwidespread disenchantmentamong Arab American voters, a relatively small but significant demographic in key battleground states.

A report released this month by the Council on American-Islamic Relations found support for third-party candidate Jill Stein surpassed support for either Harris or Trump among Muslims in several battleground states.

Arshad Hasan, a progressive Democratic strategist, said that by not engaging with the Uncommitted National Movement, the Harris campaign had failed on both a human and an electoral level.

“This is a group of people who are generally ideologically aligned [with Democrats] and who are energetic, and it doesn’t cost the Harris campaign anything to meet with them and to meet with impacted families, which is what they were asking for,” he told Al Jazeera.

“I’m entirely disappointed in the Harris-Walz campaign,” Hassan said. “And I say this as a supporter.”







Sally Howell, director of the Center for Arab American Studies at the University of Michigan in Dearborn, said Democrats were taking a “huge hit” with Arab voters.

The Uncommitted Movement’s nonendorsement could prove particularly damaging for voters “who are not in the progressive camp and were already struggling with the [Democrats]”, she told Al Jazeera.

“This weakens the progressive Arabs in their own community for certain, even as they are appreciated for their courage and outspokenness on this,” she said.

During the at times emotional virtual news conference, Uncommitted National Movement leaders recounted their personal struggles in determining how to cast their votes as they have watched their own familiesstruggle to survivein the occupied Palestinian territories.

Elabed, a Democrat, said with family in the occupied West Bank, “I can’t make the decision to vote for Vice President Harris at the top of the ticket.”

“But I also would never vote for someone like Donald Trump,” she said.

Lexis Zeidan, another leader of the movement, said she felt the Harris campaign was “courting people like Dick Cheney” while pushing aside key segments of the Democratic base.

Cheney, the former Republican vice president under President George W Bush and one of the main architects of the US’s “global war on terror” of the 2000s, recently endorsed Harris for president.







Meanwhile, Zeidan said the Harris campaign is “sidelining these disillusioned antiwar voices, even pushing them to consider third-party votes or to sit this incredibly important election out”.

Alawieh echoed that, saying the Harris campaign had put many voters in an impossible position. But he stressed that the group’s advocacy would not stop.

“Our organising around the presidential election was never about endorsing a specific candidate,” he said. “It’s always been about building a movement that saves lives.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/19/sidelining-antiwar-voices-us-uncommitted-movement-not-endorsing-harris,NEGATIVE,0.9967400431632996
Kamala Harris,"Harris message to migrants: ‘Do not come, do not come’","United States Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off a three-day diplomatic trip to the Northern Triangle on Monday focused on stemmingmigration to the US.

During a joint news conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei held, Harris said that it is important to discourage people from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras – the three countries where the majority of migrants hail from – from making a journey to the US border.

“The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders,” Harris said. “If you come to our border you will be turned back.”

“Do not come, do not come,” she said.

The administration of US President Joe Biden, which took office in January, is under pressure to stema surge in migrant arrivalsfrom Central America fleeing poverty and corruption.

Harris also announced new steps to combat human trafficking, smuggling and corruption in Guatemala.

“The President and I agreed to continue our work to manage migration at Guatemala’s northern and southern borders,” she said.

“We also discussed illicit drugs that are being smuggled and humans who are being trafficked across these borders undermining the security of both Guatemala and the people of the United States.”

She said the US would help create a smuggling and human trafficking task force as well as an anti-corruption task force, charged with supporting and training local prosecutors to create an independent judiciary that would root our corruption networks in the country.

Non-governmental organisations placed Guatemala’s widespread corruption at the top of their list of concerns before Harris’s visit. Last month, two lawyers who are outspoken critics of Giammattei’s administration were arrested on what they say were trumped-up charges aimed at silencing them.

When asked by a journalist on Monday whether Giammattei would be a reliable partner for the US to combat corruption, the president denied charges that his government is involved.

“How many cases of corruption have I been accused of? I can give you the answer: Zero,” Giammattei said.

William Lawrence, professor of international relations at the American University in Washington, DC said the US is hoping to find ways to stem migration in the short term as well as address the structural issues that have led to people seeking to migrate to the US.

“You have to simultaneously both deal with the border issues – where there have been some improvements despite the surge – and the systemic issues that send so many migrants heading for the border,” Lawrence told Al Jazeera television.

In an effort to tackle the “root causes” of migration, the Biden administration has pledged a $4bn plan to boost development in the region and$310m in humanitarian aid.

Al Jazeera’s Manuel Rapalo, reporting from Tecun Uman on Guatemala’s border with Mexico, said the US aid and funding to programmes in the region andGuatemalain particular, are not new. And making meaningful advances on corruption is going to be the nation’s responsibility.

“Ultimately it is up to the government of Guatemala that foreign aid isn’t lost to corruption,” Rapalo said, adding that without making structural changes “no amount of foreign aid will prevent people from fleeing north”.

Harris is scheduled to meet civil society leaders and entrepreneurs in Guatemala and then fly to Mexico where she will meet President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday.

Harris also announced that the US would supply half a million COVID-19 doses to Guatemala.

Shortly before meeting Giammattei Harris said her trip to the country demonstrated the Biden’s administration focus on re-establishing ties with allies around the world and was “a reflection of the priority President Biden placed on this region”.

“It is in our collective interest that we work together,” Harris said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/7/harris-meets-guatemalan-president-tackles-immigration,NEGATIVE,0.8436134457588196
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has escalated his personal attacks on his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, by repeating an insult that she was “mentally impaired” while also saying she should be “impeached and prosecuted”.

Trump’s rally on Sunday in Erie, Pennsylvania, took on similar themes as an event the day before that he described as a “dark speech”. He claimed in front of a cheering crowd on Sunday that Harris was responsible for an “invasion” at the United States-Mexico border and told them “she should be impeached and prosecuted for her actions”.

“Crooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired,” he added. “Sad. But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There’s something wrong with Kamala. And I just don’t know what it is, but there is definitely something missing. And you know what, everybody knows it.”

With about a month until the election, Trump is intensifying his use of personal and offensive attacks, even as some Republicans say he would be better off sticking to the issues that concern voters.

Trump has long threatened legal action against his rivals, including President Joe Biden and his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.

Trump has many legal problems of his own. He was convicted in May of falsifying business recordsin a hush money casein New York, with sentencing scheduled for November 26. Two other cases are pending – a federal case for his alleged role in theJanuary 6, 2021, insurrection, and a state case in Georgia for his effortsto overturn his 2020 loss there to Biden. Prosecutors are appealing against a federal judge’s dismissal of a case involving his handling of classified documents.

Trump argues federal and state prosecutors are targeting him for political reasons. There is no evidence to suggest that is true.

On Sunday, Trump acknowledged he might lose in November: “If she wins, it’s not going to be so pleasant for me, but I don’t care.”

Trump has derided Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, as “stupid”, “weak”, “dumb as a rock” and “lazy”. His allies have pushed him publicly and privately to talk instead about the economy, immigration and other issues.

“I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are destroying the country,” Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN’s State of the Union programme on Sunday when asked about Trump’s comments, describing Harris’s policies as “crazy liberal”.

When asked whether he approved of Trump’s personal attacks on Harris, Republican Tom Emmer sidestepped the question during an interview on ABC’s This Week.

“I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for America,” said Emmer, who is helping Trump’s running mate JD Vance prepare for Tuesday’s vice presidential debate. “I think Kamala Harris is actually as bad or worse as the administration that we’ve witnessed for the last four years.”

When pressed, Emmer said: “I think we should stick to the issues. The issues are – Donald Trump fixed it once – they broke it. He’s going to fix it again. Those are the issues.”

Harris has not commented on Trump’s recent attacks but has said when asked about other comments that it was the “same old show. The same tired playbook we’ve heard for years with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people.”

Kamala Harris,"Kamala Harris to unveil $50,000 tax deduction for new small businesses","United States Vice President Kamala Harris is set to unveil a tax deduction of up to $50,000 for new small businesses as the Democratic nominee seeks to burnish her economic credentials in the close race for the White House.

Harris is due to unveil the plan on Wednesday in New Hampshire, where she will announce a goal of 25 million new small business applications during her first four years in office if elected in November.

Under current tax rules, small businesses can claim up to $5,000 for expenses related to their first year of operation.

Harris flagged the plans at a campaign stop in Savannah, Georgia last week, saying that growing small businesses was one of her “singular priorities”.

“Half of America’s working population either owns, runs or works in a small business,” she said.

Harris has eked out a modest lead against former President Donald Trump in most polls since entering the race in July, but has often been rated as less competent to handle the economy than her Republican rival.

Harris, who became the Democratic nominee afterPresident Joe Biden in July announced he would not seek re-election, has also faced criticism for releasing few policy proposals and not taking questions from the media.

Harris’s latest policy announcement comes as she prepares to face off against Trump in their first presidential debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.

Since entering the race, Harris has cast her economic agenda as more beneficial for middle-class Americans than the proposals put forward by Trump, who has called for heavy tax cuts, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 15 percent.

In her first set of economic policy announcements last month, Harris laid out a set of proposals to build an “opportunity economy”, including a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers, a $6,000 child tax benefit for newborns, and a federal ban on price gouging for groceries.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/9/4/kamala-harris-to-unveil-50000-tax-deduction-for-new-small-businesses,NEGATIVE,0.9193041324615479
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Vice PresidentKamala Harrishas sought to reassure her supporters that, while they did not win the United States presidential election this year, the fight is far from over.

“The outcome of the election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,” she said in a concession speech to a crowd of students and supporters at Howard University in Washington, DC, her alma mater.

“Hear me when I say the light of America’s promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.”

Her address on Wednesday afternoon was the first time Harris had spoken to her supporters since Republican candidate Donald Trump won the race.

Many had waited outside in tears on the university grounds on Tuesday night as the election unfolded. But an expected late-night speech never materialised: Her campaign director emerged to tell them that Harris was going to wait until more results came in.

By early Wednesday, the race had been called for Trump, whopassed the thresholdof 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency.

The mood on Wednesday afternoon was decidedly more upbeat when Harris spoke, with huge cheers and screams emanating from the crowd.

“I know folks have a range of emotions, I get it,” Harris said with a laugh.

“I spoke with Trump and congratulated him and told him we will help him with the transition and engage with a peaceful transfer of power.”

Harris then made a pointed dig at Trump who campaigned on his refusal to concede that he lost the 2020 presidential election to President Joe Biden.

“It’s a fundamental principle of a democracy that when we lose an election, we accept the result,” she said.

But Harris added that did not mean she was giving up.

“While I concede this election I don’t not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign,” she said. “To the young people, it is OK to feel sad and disappointed. Please know it will be OK.”

She added: “On the campaign, we say when we fight we win, sometimes the fight takes a while … It doesn’t mean we won’t win.”

Harris ended her speech by thanking her husband Doug Emhoff for his support.

“I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of all of us, I hope that is not the case,” she said.







Harris, 60, began campaigning afterBidenstepped out of the race after stumbling badly in a June presidential debate with Trump. His performance sparked concerns about his ability to serve until the end of a second term in 2029, when he would be 86.

Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president. Harris quickly took over the Democratic campaign.

She was seen among many Democrats as a potential saviour for her party: the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian descent who could reach the Oval Office. Four years ago, she broke the same barriers for the vice presidency by becoming Biden’s second in command.

Harris ran an energetic campaign focused on moving away from Trump’s dark message of economic ruin and immigrants flooding the country. A key element of her platform was her advocacy for women’s reproductive freedom, a rallying cry that resonated with many young voters who flocked to her rallies.

The 2024 race was the first presidential campaign since theUS Supreme Courtstruck down constitutional protection for abortion rights two years prior, in June 2022. The Harris campaign had hoped for a surge of support from women.

But it wasn’t enough to overcome the deep anger among US voters over high inflation, the cost of basic necessities such as food and housing, and worries about undocumented immigration, according to exit polls.

Trump’s promise to return to a “golden age of America” saw the key battleground states move decisively away from the Democrats.

He is due to take office on January 20, 2025, returning to power as the 47th US president four years after refusing to accept defeat to President Joe Biden.

As the sitting vice president, Harris is expected to oversee Congress’s ceremonial certification of Trump’s win. Biden has also said he will attend the inauguration, unlike Trump in 2021 who snubbed his successor.

Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris: Vice president and Democratic Party heir apparent?,"Kamala Harris will step into the United States vice presidency on Wednesday, making history as the first woman and the first person of colour to assume the role of second-in-command.

Upon being sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on the steps of the US Capitol, Harris will also be entering the next step in her political journey as President-elect Joe Biden’s deputy – and an early contender to be the next US president.

“Harris is a brilliant, dynamic woman and policymaker, who has shown she can gain the trust of a large swath of the Democratic Party,” Derrick Plumber, a Democratic strategist, told Al Jazeera. “That solidifies her in her own right, not only as vice president but into the future.”

But, he added, her fate will now be tied to the Biden administration’s success: “As goes the president, goes the vice president.”

Biden, who at 78 will be the oldest person in history to assume the US presidency, has hedged questions about whether he will run for a second term in 2024.

The next four – or eight – years as vice president will be proving ground for Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants who sought to split the difference between the party’s centrist and progressive flank during her primary bid.

After proving herself as a dutiful deputy during the campaign, from day one, Harris may experience a different climate than previous vice presidents, said Joel Goldstein, a professor of law emeritus as Saint Louis University and the author of several books on the vice presidency.

“She has symbolic importance, and I think they’re going to be demands on her, and perhaps there will be opportunities for her, that will be different than her predecessors,” he told Al Jazeera.

One significant benefit Harris, who will be part of an administration that will include fellow primary challenger Pete Buttigieg as transportation secretary, will have going into the next four years is a boss who has had her job.







During eight years as vice president, Biden and President Barack Obama cultivated a close relationship that saw Biden deeply engaged in White House dealings.

“When I agreed to serve as President Obama’s running mate, he asked me a number of questions most important … he asked me what I wanted most,” Biden recounted upon selecting Harris in August. “I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions.

“That’s what I asked Kamala. I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room.”







Meanwhile, Harris, when asked during an ABC News interview how she defined success as vice president, responded: “Joe Biden’s success.”

The designation of Harris as the “last person in the room” will give her added cachet not just in Washington, DC, but on the international stage, which could prove helpful in her future ambitions, said Goldstein.

“It not only gives the vice president the opportunity to have her say, but it makes the vice president a lot more important to a lot of other people,” he said.

“Other members of the administration are going to want the vice president to be on their side of debates … Foreign leaders are going to want to develop relations with the vice president,” he said.

“It’s a source of enormous power.”

Harris, who under the US Constitution will be preside over the Senate, will also have a prominent role as the deciding vote in the chamber that is currently divided 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans.

As vice president, Biden was tasked with “a lot of legislative closing”, often calling on his decades of experience in the Senate and his deep-relationships across the aisle, said Goldstein.

Harris, in her four years in the chamber, has had a far more combative relationship with Republicans. Instead, Biden is more likely to call upon Harris for her skills as “a very effective communicator”, he said.

Meanwhile, Biden’s transition team has not yet announced a portfolio for Harris, but transition officials have said she will have a robust voice in shaping the administration.

There had been early speculation that the former prosecutor would spearhead criminal justice reform following a year of unrest surrounding high-profile police killings of Black people in the US.

As district attorney of San Francisco, and later California’s attorney general, Harris had styled herself a progressive working for more equitable justice for minority communities. However, she has faced criticism from the left for some of her policies while in office.

In the Senate, Harris was central to developing a bill to address deadly use of force by police in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in May. Her cross-examination style of questioning also made her a standout during hearings in the chamber.

But given the Biden administration is taking control in the middle of a national health and economic crisis spurred by COVID-19 pandemic, Harris will most likely be consumed by the “many, many different fires that need to be put out very quickly”, said Kyle Kopko, an adjunct professor of political science at Elizabethtown College.

“This is, hopefully, a once in a lifetime type of quagmire. If they are able to get us out of that. That’s going to be not only good policy, but a great political win,” said Kopko, the author of, Do Running Mates Matter? The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidate in Presidential Elections.

Harris’s role in helping to turn out Black voters during the election, particularly in Georgia, which flipped Democratic for the first time since 1992 and where dual Democratic Senate victories gave the party control of the Senate, also bodes well for her future ambitions, said Plummer.

Still, following a Democratic primary that saw one of the largest, and most diverse, field of candidates in US history, the future of the party remains unclear.

“The spectrum of the Democratic Party is so significant, and the next couple of years will ultimately determine where a potential candidate will come from to replace Biden – whether that be in four years or eight,” Plummer said.

“That said, history has shown that generally after a successful presidency, the vice president will run,” he said. “So, Harris could find herself very well poised.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/19/kamala-harris-vice-president-and-possible-heir-apparent,POSITIVE,0.9995504021644592
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"In her closing pitch for the presidency of the United States, Democrat aspirant Kamala Harris has promised to end the war in Gaza.

Campaigning in the swing state of Michigan, home to manyArab Americans, Harris, 60, on Sunday tried to reach voters disgruntled by theongoing genocide, which has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians and displaced almost the entire 2.3 million residents of Gaza.

“This year has been difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon, it is devastating. And as president, I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure, and ensure the Palestinian people can realise their right to dignity, freedom, security and self-determination,” Harris said to applause during a rally in East Lansing city of Michigan, home to 200,000 Arab Americans.

She did not elaborate on how she planned to end the Gaza war, which critics say is backed by the US, the largest military supplier to Israel.







Both Harris, the current US vice president, and her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, 78, are making their final appeals with less than 36 hours left until polls open forTuesday’s election.

Israel’s ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon have been a contentious issue in the campaign, with many voters condemning the US’s continued support for Israel amid mounting deaths, displacement and destruction in both places.

Since Israel began bombing Gaza following a rare Hamas attack inside Israel in October last year, Harris, like her boss, President Joe Biden, has repeatedly stated that Israel had a right to defend itself against its enemies. That, despite expressing concerns over disproportionate Palestinian civilian deaths due to Israel’s military campaign.







Harris, who has also promised to continue arming Israel if elected,badly needsto secure a majority in the seven pivotal battleground states in this year’s election amid a virtual dead heat with Trump nationally. A compilation of opinion polls by the RealClearPolitics website has Trump ahead by just 0.1 percent nationally, with five polls indicating they are locked in a tie.

Michigan, with a vibrant Arab and Muslim community and 15 Electoral College votes at stake, is crucial to Harris’s prospects. It, as well as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are considered this year’s swing states.

Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – once considered reliably Democratic – are crucial this year. Known as the “blue wall”, these states fell to Trump in 2016, only to be secured by Biden in 2020.

Trump on Friday visited Dearborn, Michigan, the heart of the Arab American community, and promised to end the conflict in the Middle East, also without saying how.

Ahead of Election Day, more than 78 million Americans have already cast early ballots, including about 700,000 more Democrats than Republicans, according to data published by the University of Florida Election Lab.

Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris says no US troops to fight in Israel-Hamas war,"The “US is not telling Israel what to do,” Vice President Kamala Harris has stated, as debate over Washington’s stance on the war in Gaza mounts.

Speaking in aninterviewwith CBS on Sunday, Harris stressed that the United States is only providing advice, equipment and diplomatic support to Israel. US troops will not be sent to Israel or Gaza, she added.

US policy regarding the conflict has come under increased focus after Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country’s war with Hamas has entered its “second stage”.

“A terrorist organisation, Hamas, slaughtered hundreds of young people at a concert … Israel, without any question, has a right to defend itself,” Harris told CBS reporter Bill Whitaker.

“That being said, it is very important that there be no conflation between Hamas and the Palestinians. The Palestinians deserve equal measures of safety and security, self-determination and dignity, and we have been very clear that the rules of war must be adhered to and that there be humanitarian aid that flows,” she said.

Asked whether the war could drag US troops in to fight, Harris said: “We have absolutely no intention nor do we have any plans to send combat troops into Israel or Gaza, period.”

Harris also noted that while the US wants to ensure the conflict does not escalate, it has not been easy.

Her comments came after theUS struck facilities in Syrialinked to Iran last week, following a series of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria.

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the strikes in Syria are not connected to the Israel-Hamas war, despite claims that the tit-for-tat attacks came due to Washington’s stance on the Israel-Gaza war.

US President Joe Biden has also told reporters that Washington’s response has “nothing to do” with Israel.

Yet Harris also noted to Whitaker that President Biden has warned Iran not to create a wider conflict.

Vice President Harris’s comments are in line with the White House stance. But within Washington’s diplomatic corridors there are signs of friction.

Democrats seeking a ceasefire are frustrated over Biden’s continuing steadfast support for Israel amid its blockade and bombardment of Gaza.

US diplomats arereportedto be preparing a “dissent cable”. The document, criticising Washington’s policy, will go to State Department leaders.

“There’s basically a mutiny brewing within State at all levels,” one State Department official told the Huffington Post.

Last week, State Department official Josh Paul resigned, citing the Biden administration’s stance on the Israel-Hamas war as a reason.

“Hamas’ attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities … But I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people – and is not in the long term American interest,” Paulwrotein a Linkedin Post.

An October 24 unclassified diplomatic cablereportedon by VICE News, reveals that the US Office of Palestinians Affairs in Jerusalem had warned the White House of the dire situation facing Palestinians in Gaza and called on Washington to take action.

However, two days later, President Bidencast doubtover the number of people dead in Gaza, saying that he has “no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using”.

That helped stir further dissent regarding the US’s humanitarian response.

Yara Asi, a Palestinian American public health expert at the University of Central Florida, called the president’s remarks “appalling”.

“To dispute those figures was really, really just putting both feet in with Israel on this, in yet another way that dehumanises Palestinians,” Asi told Al Jazeera.

US Senator Brian Schatz said that he was “deeply concerned” following a near-total communications blackout on Friday.

“There already is a dire humanitarian situation, including dangerous proximity to military operations for civilians and insufficient amounts of food, water, medicine, and fuel,” he said on X.

There are signs that Biden’s administration may be beginning to respond to the criticism.

According to aWashington Post report, Washington pressured the Israeli government to switch communication channels back on.

On Sunday, the White House said that Biden called for “accelerating” humanitarian assistance to Gaza in phone calls with the leaders of Israel and Egypt.

The US leader reiterated to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “Israel has every right to defend its citizens from terrorism and a responsibility to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law which prioritises the protection of civilians.”

In his conversation with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, Biden agreed to commit “to work together” in protecting civilian lives and “ensure” that Palestinians in Gaza are not displaced to Egypt or any other nation, the White House said.

Humanitarian aid has trickled into Gaza through the Rafah crossing run by Egypt, the only crossing not controlled by Israel.

However, the UN and other agencies have warned that the current flow of aid to the 2.3 million people in Gaza, is still a “drop in the ocean”.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States Vice President Kamala Harris has secured the votes needed to become the Democratic 2024 presidential nominee, the party’s chairman said, setting up a November showdown against Republican Donald Trump.

Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said on Friday that Harris had crossed the threshold of delegate votes needed to clinch the nomination. The online voting process – known asa virtual roll call– does not formally end until Monday.

“I am so proud to confirm that Vice President Harris has earned more than a majority of votes from all convention delegates, and will be the nominee of the Democratic Party following the close of voting on Monday,” Harrison said during a call with supporters.

Harris, the first Black and the first Asian Americanvice president in US history, is now poised to be the first woman of colour at the top of a major US political party’s ticket.

“I am honored to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. I will officially accept the nomination next week,” shewroteon social media.

“This campaign is about people coming together, fueled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are.”

Coming only a day after the virtual roll call began, the widely expected announcement followed a statement from Harris’s campaign that said it had raised $310m last month amid a surge in small donations.







The campaign said the July figure includesmore than $200m in donationsin the week after President Joe Biden’s decision to end his re-election campaign.

Harris has secured strong backing from her party since she entered the race, with Harrison – the DNC chair – saying on Friday that Democrats planned to “rally around” her during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this month.

Harris’s campaign also said two-thirds of its July donations came from first-time donors, signalling “tremendous support” for her candidacy.

The sum is more than double the $138.7m raised in July by former President Trump, the GOP’s 2024 nominee.

“There has never been anything like the MAGA Movement,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday evening, referring to supporters who rally under his Make America Great Again slogan.

“We raised $139 Million Dollars in July alone. We now have a whopping $327 Million Cash On Hand. Spectacular support from Great American Patriots who are donating to our Campaign for President of the United States, and helping out in many other ways,” he said.







Trump launched ad hominem attacks against Harris this week, includingquestions about her racial identitythat critics slammed as “repulsive”.

The heated rhetoric comes as recent opinion pollssuggested a tight racebetween Trump and Harris as the November 5 election nears, with several swing states expected to be key to who wins the White House.

Harris is also expected to soon announce hervice-presidential running mate, a decision that could provide a boost in those critical battleground states.

Several names have been floated as being on the vice president’s list, including Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.

Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s John Hendren said Harris will be looking to pick a candidate “who does no harm” – the importance of which has been highlighted by the Republican presidential campaign.

“Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, has said a number of things that have gotten him into trouble and that havegotten bad pressfor the campaign,” Hendren noted.







Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC’s) newest advertising campaign, launched on Friday, taunted Trump for not committing to a debate with Harris.

The DNC has bought large advertisements that dominate the digital homepages of major local newspapers in states where Trump plans to campaign in the coming weeks. The advertisements say “the convicted felon is afraid to debate” and question whether that is due to his stance on abortion.

Trump in May became thefirst former president in US historyto be convicted of a crime when he was found guilty in a New York hush-money case.

He also previously boasted that he “was able to kill Roe v Wade”, the legal precedent that had guaranteed abortion access nationwide but was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022.

Trump appointed three justices to the top US court during his presidency, giving it a conservative majority.

The DNC said its first ads are running on The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s homepage before Trump’s visit to the Georgia state capital on Saturday and the advertisement campaign will follow him through local news outlets at each rally stop.

Bidendropped out of the raceafter a disastrous July debate performance against Trump that raised questions about his age and ability to serve another term in office.

Trump has suggested a planned September 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to Fox News.

In a phone call with reporters last week, Trump was asked if he would commit to debating Harris at least once. “Oh, yes, absolutely. I’d want to,” he responded.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/2/harris-campaign-raises-310m-in-july-as-eyes-turn-to-vp-pick,POSITIVE,0.9827890992164612
Kamala Harris,Beyond abortion rights: Why did Kamala Harris lose women’s votes?,"Donald Trump’s defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election has signalled women’s rights – specifically the right to an abortion – was less of a key issue than expected for voters.

This was the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade court ruling, which ended a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy. Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for that 2022 verdict, which was made possible by his appointments of three conservative judges to the top court.

The Harris campaign made much of Trump’s stance on reproductive rights in a bid to woo female voters, particularly in the swing states. However,early national exit polls showed that Harris had won the support of 54 percent of women, lower than President Joe Biden did in 2020 when he had the support of 57 percent.

So what happened to the female vote?

The Supreme Court’s overturning ofRoe v Wadein June 2022 was a huge turning point for women’s reproductive rights in the US and sparked a massive backlash from women’s rights and medical groups.

Overturning Roe had been a key campaign promise that Trump successfully contested the 2016 election on.

In light of the uproar over the Supreme Court’s ruling, Democrats expected the issue to loom large this election, and Harris shaped much of her campaign around it.

Harris’s campaign focused on highlighting statements Trump has made about abortion.

For example, one advert that the Harris campaign ran close to the polls was titled Punishment, referencing a statement by Trump before the 2016 election in which he suggested women who try to obtain abortions should be punished.

However, in 2016, Trump moved back from this position, clarifying that any punishment would be for doctors performing the procedure, not women undergoing it.

On October 29 this year, Harris stated that Trump would “force states to monitor women’s pregnancies”. She urged listeners to “Google Project 2025 and read the plans for yourself”, referring to a conservative policy blueprint assembled by some of Trump’s supporters but which Trump has distanced himself from.

This claim by Harris wasdeemed false by PolitiFact, a fact-checking outlet.

Ultimately, while it is true that Trump and his Republican aides have been called out for makingsexist remarksabout women, Trump made up for it by strategically distancing himself from the notion of afederal abortion banin the run-up to this election, stating he believed it should be for individual states to decide on laws about abortion.

Instead, he focused on rallying support among the working class by focusing on economic policy as the main thrust of his campaign.

Trump’s running mate,JD Vance, in 2022 said he supported a nationwide abortion ban. However, in July this year, Vance said he was aligned with Trump on the idea that abortion should be an issue that each state deals with.

According to a survey of female voters conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and published on October 11, the top issue that emerged for women voters overall was inflation, including rising household expenses. More than one-third (36 percent) of respondents cited it as the most important issue.

This was followed by threats to democracy, which 24 percent of respondents cited, and immigration and border security, which 13 percent of women cited. The same number – 13 percent – cited abortion as the most important issue.

The national exit polls were consistent with this.

According to a preliminary national exit poll conducted by data provider Edison Research, 31 percent of voters said the economy mattered most in shaping their decision to vote whereas 14 percent cited abortion.

Women did vote for Harris but by a smaller margin than they did for Democrats in previous elections – for Biden in 2020 and for Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016.

CNN’s exit polls found that Harris won female voters’ support by 10 percentage points over Trump. But in 2020, Biden won their support by 15 percentage points, and in 2016, Clinton did by 13 percentage points.

While Harris made slight inroads with white female voters, Trump still won them by 8 percentage points. Historically, white women have voted for the Republican candidate.

According to the CNN polls, Harris also won 92 percent of the votes ofBlack women, compared with Trump’s 8 percent. This was up from Biden’s 90.5 percent vote share in 2020.

However, the Democrats lost support amongLatina womenthis time. Harris won 61 percent of their votes this election – 22 percentage points above Trump. But this margin was markedly lower than the 39-point lead Biden had over Trump with Latina women in 2020.

Harris focused too much on abortion rather than more salient issues, such as economic policies, that would appeal to working class voters, including women, David Schultz, an author and political science professor at Minnesota’s Hamline University, told Al Jazeera.

Voters had more confidence in Trump’s ability to handle the economy, and the Republican candidate ostensibly was better at persuading working class and middle class voters on his economic policies. Harris on the other hand, appealed more to college-educated, upper middle class voters.

White women with college degrees tended to vote for Harris this election – 53.5 percent did so – while 64 percent of white women without degrees voted for Trump, according to a CNN poll.

“The Harris campaign did not necessarily do a good job of explaining how her policies would help the middle class, or at least that message wasn’t really resonating with a lot of voters,” Melissa Deckman, a political scientist and the CEO of Public Religion Research Institute, told the Reuters news agency.

Schultz added that this caused Harris to lose critical battleground states that hadconsistently voted for Democratsbefore 2016. “Harris lost Wisconsin because she lost the working class and did not win women, suburbs and young voters,” he said.

An early national exit poll showed that 51 percent of voters trusted Trump with handling the economy compared with the 47 percent who trusted Harris.

An analysis by the Washington, DC-based Brookings Institution think tank also found Harris had inherited America’s disapproval of Biden, which has grown during his presidency because of economic dissatisfaction. Americans were particularly displeased with Biden’s handling of inflation, according to polls compiled by the FiveThirtyEight website. Since Biden came to power, consumer prices have risen bymore than 19 percent.

The Brookings analysis also indicated Harris made some wrong tactical choices. For example, her decision toavoid media interviewswhen she first appeared on the Democratic ticket led to voters losing confidence in her ability to think on her feet, Brookings said.

Deckman added that Harris’s choice of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro was another of “several mistakes” made by the Democrats in the run-up to this election. This is because Walz did not help Harris sway any swing states. Minnesota has voted Democratic in every single presidential election since 1976.

Once Trump takes power in January, a nationwide abortion ban seems unlikely, but states may restrict abortion.

Before this year’s election, Trump said he would veto any federal abortion ban because he believes abortion is an issue that should be left to each state.

As of this week, abortion is banned in 13 states under almost all circumstances. In an additional four states, abortion is banned past six weeks of pregnancy.

Some states place limits at 12 weeks, 15 weeks or 18 weeks or have longer gestational limits. Nine states and the District of Columbia place no restrictions on abortion.

On Tuesday, 10 states voted on whether to embed the right to abortion in their constitutions. These measures were brought to the ballot by abortion rights groups.

Seven states passed the abortion rights amendments, paving the way for abortion restrictions to be lifted in Missouri, where abortion was banned under any circumstances except medical emergencies, and Arizona, where abortions were banned past 15 weeks. These restrictions will be lifted in the coming weeks.

The measures also passed in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Montana and Nevada, where abortion is legal but now this will be enshrined in their state constitutions.

Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota failed to pass their own amendments, and their bans remain. Florida bans abortions past six weeks of pregnancy, Nebraska bans them past 12 weeks and South Dakota bans them in almost all circumstances.

However, The New York Timesreportedon Wednesday that anti-abortion Republicans will place pressure on Trump to enact a federal ban on abortion.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"The debate between United States Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump startedwith a handshakeand ended with the candidates painting one another as awful leaders who should not be elected.

Harris and Trumptraded barbs for more than 90 minutes on Tuesday, in a debate that was light on substantive policy and heavy on personal attacks.

Trumptried to portrayHarris as a far-left candidate who would pursue open-border policies, ban fracking and confiscate people’s guns. He also pushed to link her to President Joe Biden, painting them as fundamentally the same type of politician.

Harris responded by questioning Trump’s fitness for office and calling him a “disgrace”. She also attempted to dismiss the former president as an object of ridicule. At several points, she appeared to be suppressing her laughter as Trump spoke.

Even pundits on conservative channels like Fox News observed that Harris seemed to leave Trump rattled. And in the minutes following the debate, pop starTaylor Swift offeredHarris her endorsement.

Here are a few takeaways from the debate — the first meeting of the two candidates.

Trump’s rhetoric throughout the debate zigzagged across an array of topics, rarely sticking with the subject matter presented in the moderators’ questions.

One moment Trump would be talkingabout the economy, and the next, he would be talking about pipelines.

In one breath, he would talk about healthcare. In the next, he would bring up immigration. Then he would talk about something else, then immigration again.

Trump struggled to stay on message throughout the debate. His answers lacked focus, and he appeared more concerned with landing blows against Harris.

Again and again, he boomeranged back to immigration, hoping to score points by invoking Harris’s record on the issue. At several points, he also promoted the falsehood that Haitian migrants and refugees in Springfield, Ohio, areeating people’s pets.

“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” he said.

City officials have dismissed these accounts as untrue.

Still, Trump has always been known for his rambling speaking style, so it is not certain that voters will view him more negatively after Tuesday’s debate performance.

Harris, meanwhile, launched pointed barbs at Trump and appeared to get under his skin, calling him a “disgrace” on several occasions.

The vice president alsohighlighted the Republicansand former aides who turned against Trump after he won office in 2016.

Borrowing a leaf from Trump’s playbook, Harris called the Republican candidate “weak” as well. She repurposed the Trumpian accusation that the world would laugh at US leadership and directed it back at the former president.

It is “absolutely well-known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again”, Harris told Trump.

She added that it is “so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favours, and so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me you are a disgrace”.

Both Republican and Democratic administrations, however, have maintained close ties to autocratic governments and leaders across the world.

In his rebuttals, the former president pushed to portray Harris as more left-wing than she actually is. He even called her a “Marxist”.

“She has a plan to confiscate everybody’s gun,” said Trump, in another exaggeration.

Harris responded that she and her vice presidential pickTim Walzare, in fact, gun owners.

Trump also accused Harris of planning todefund the police.

As a senator in 2020, Harris voiced support for efforts to reexamine the budgets of police departments, but she has not called for defunding the police. The Biden administration has also backed increasing the number of police officers nationwide.

On healthcare, Trump said Harris “wants everybody to be on government insurance”. While Harris previously voiced support for universal, government-funded healthcare, she changed her position while running for president in 2020.

Trump’s charges at the debate fit into his larger campaign strategy of arguing that Harris is a far-left “radical” Democrat. That strategy, experts say, is designed to dissuade independent voters from backing her.







When asked about thewar in Gaza, both candidates reached for their usual talking points.

Harris said she backs a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would see the release of Israeli captives, but she renewed her pledge to continue to arm Israel. She also voiced support for the two-state solution.

“Israel has a right to defend itself… and how it does so matters, because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed — children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end,” she said.

“I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular, as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel.”

The language she used echoes previous statements she and other Democratic officials have made, including at August’s Democratic National Convention.

Harris continues to regurgitate the same position on Israel from the DNC and her campaign website.

She must listen to voters— end Israel’s atrocities, impose an arms embargo, and enforce U.S. law.#Debate2024

— USCPR ACTION (@uscpr_action)September 11, 2024



For his part, Trump reiterated his position that the war in the Middle East would not have broken out if he were in office. He also accused Harris of having a bias against Israel.

“She hates Israel. At the same time, in her own way, she hates the Arab population because the whole place is going to get blown up — Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. Israel will be gone,” he said.

In addition, Trump falsely asserted that theBiden administrationlifted US sanctions against Iran.

More than two years into Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, support for the war has become a dividing line between the two major political parties in the US.

Many Republicans are wary of offering more aid, while Democrats largely support bolstering Ukraine’s ability to defend itself.

That division was visible on Tuesday’s debate stage. On the subject of Ukraine, the two candidates did not appear to be on the same page.

While Trump said he would push for a deal to end the conflict, Harris stressed the need to support Ukrainian forces to push back against the Russian invasion.

Asked whether theUS should continueits push for Ukraine to win the war, Trump said: “I think it’s in the US’s best interest to get this war finished and just get it done and negotiate a deal because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.”

Trump argued that the lack of leadership in the Biden administration allowed Russia to invade Ukraine.







Harris slammed the former president’s reluctance to pledge full-fledged support for Ukraine, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin would be in Kyiv by now if Trump were in office.

“Understand, our European allies — NATO allies — are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military the world has known, which is NATO,” she said.

“The reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/11/five-takeaways-from-donald-trump-and-kamala-harriss-us-presidential-debate,NEGATIVE,0.9331289529800415
Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris is influenced by her Indian and Jamaican heritage,"Kamala Harris is not just the first Black woman to be selected as a vice-presidential candidate in the United States.

A child of immigrants, Harris is the first woman of Indian and Jamaican descent to reach a position in US politics that has long been reserved for whites only.









Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is betting that, on balance, Harris will have broad appeal with Black women and other voters of colour and serve as an anchor for the Democratic Party – all while boosting turnout among white liberals and pulling support from independents and Republican-leaning white voters who have soured on President Donald Trump. Indeed, Harris’s human life story stands in sharp political contrast to the severe anti-immigrant policies of Trump and his administration.

“Our family feels happy and I feel happy that my sister, Shyamala, her mother, would have been very happy and proud of her daughter,” Harris’s maternal uncle Gopalan Balachandran told media outlets in India on Wednesday.

“It’s a historic day in number of ways for the Indian community for the first time getting into a high political position,” Balachandran said, according to the Reuters news agency.

Harris was born in Oakland, California in 1964 to a British Jamaican-born father, Donald Harris, and an Indian mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris. She spent many of her formative years in nearby Berkeley.

On the campaign trail, Harris often speaks of the deep bond she shared with her mother, who she has called her single biggest influence.

“My mother understood very well she as raising two Black daughters,” Harris wrote in a 2018 autobiography.

“She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident Black women,” she wrote. Their mother gave them Sanskrit names to carry their Indian identities.

Shyamala was born in 1938 in Chennai, formerly Madras in British India. She came to the US for graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where she met her future husband, a doctoral student in economics in the early 1960s.

For two freethinking young people drawn to activism, they landed on campus from opposite sides of the world just as US protests exploded around civil rights, the Vietnam War and voting rights. Their paths crossed in those movements, and they fell in love, according to an Associated Press 2019 candidate profile of Harris.

At the heart of Harris’s parents’ activism was a small group of students who met every Sunday to discuss the books of Black authors and grassroots activity around the world, from the anti-apartheid Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa to liberation movements in Latin America to the Black separatist preaching of Malcolm X in the US.

Harris says her mother gave her an early grounding in the civil rights movement and instilled in her a duty not to complain but rather to act.

Her mother died of cancer in 2009 at the age of 70.

Today, the senator finds herself asking her mother, spiritually, for advice or remembering one of her oft-repeated lines. Her mother’s amethyst ring sparkles from her hand. She still uses pots and wooden spoons that belonged to her mother and says she thinks of her when she is home and able to cook.

“She [Kamala Harris] likes South Indian food because when I used to go to her [place], my sister used to cook and she used to eat all of that, so, she likes Indian food,” said Balachandran, Harris’s uncle.

“Yeah, she is Indian, she likes India but that doesn’t mean anything that India says is right for her, good for her. She is also Jamaican. She is Afro-American. So, she uses her own judgement … she likes India, she likes Indian music, but she likes jazz music also,” he said.

Almost immediately after the announcement of Harris’s candidacy, Trump attacked Harris by reverting to stereotypes, calling her “extraordinarily nasty”, “meanest”, and “most horrible” during a White House news conference on Tuesday.

Karen Finney, a prominent Black strategist in the Democratic Party, pointed to immediate fundraising success as evidence that Biden’s take on Harris is better than Trump’s.

The Biden campaign hauled in almost $11m in the first four hours after Harris was announced as Biden’s pick.

The Biden-Harris ticket “makes clear that Biden is serious about having people who like the diversity of our country and our future at the highest decision-making tables. That gives people hope,” Finney told the Associated Press.

Harris’s father and her mother were separated when she was five years old. She writes of seeing him on weekends and over summers after he became a professor at Stanford University.

In a piece he wrote for the Jamaica Global website, Harris says he never gave up his love for his daughters, and the senator trumpeted her father as a superhero in her children’s book.

But their relationship had been on and off over the years. In February, when Harris jokingly linked her use of marijuana to her Jamaican heritage, her father labelled the comment a “travesty” and a shameful “pursuit of identity politics”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/12/kamala-harris-is-influenced-by-her-indian-and-jamaican-heritage,POSITIVE,0.9988258481025696
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Tim Walz may not be the most recognisable name in the politics of the United States.

But from Tuesday onwards, the Minnesota governor will be a leading figure in the presidential campaign as Vice President Kamala Harris’s Democraticrunning mate.

Harris, who has secured her party’s nomination for the November 5 polls,selected Walzas her VP pick, saying she was “proud” of her choice.

“As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his. It’s great to have him on the team,” Harris posted on X.

Walz said it was the “honour of a lifetime” to be Harris’s vice presidential pick.

“I’m all in. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school. So, let’s get this done, folks!” he posted on X.







If Harris defeats Republican nominee Donald Trump in the November polls, Walz will be a heartbeat away from the US presidency.

While vice presidents’ official duties are limited, they serve as potential heirs and partners in governing at the White House. As running mates, they aretop surrogatesfor the campaign.

So who is Walz and where does he stand on the issues driving the US election?

Walz, 60, has both executive and legislative experiences.

He was first elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and won a second term four years later. Despite the state not being a traditional Democratic stronghold, Walz won both races with ease.

Prior to his gubernatorial tenure, Walz served in the US House of Representatives for 12 years, representing a largely rural district in southern Minnesota.

Walz is also a US military veteran, having served in the Army National Guard for 24 years after joining it at the age of 17. Before running for Congress, he worked as a school teacher.

On policy, the governor has been lauded by some progressives for being able to advance left-wing priorities in a swing state.

Over the past six years, Walz has approved programmes that would cover college tuition for low-income students, implemented free breakfast and lunch at public schools, legalised recreational marijuana for adults and expanded protections for workers.

Walz is also seen as a strong defender of abortion rights. Moreover, he has backed many climate initiatives, including a law to transition Minnesota to carbon-free electricity by 2040.

While Republicans are likely to argue that Walz’s record is too liberal, the governor has not shied away from standing by his policies.



Asked about being labelled a “big government liberal”, Walz told CNN last month, “What a monster! Kids are eating and having full bellies so they can go learn, and women are making their own healthcare decisions, and we’re a top five business state, and we also rank in the top three in happiness.”

“If that’s where they want to label me, I’m more than happy to take the label,” he added.

Jennifer Victor, a political science professor at George Mason University, told Al Jazeera Walz is an “interesting choice”, noting that many Americans may not have heard of him before Tuesday.

Victor said Walz has a relatable “Midwestern vibe”. “It seems that perhaps Harris has chosen him for these positive attributes that she thinks may make the ticket more appealing to swing voters,” she said.

She highlighted Walz’s criticismof Republicansas “weird”, rather than a mortal threat to democracy.

“This was not a line of framing that we had seen Democrats successfully use against Republicans in the past, and Walz delivered it in a sort of personable, softer way that I think just resonated with more people,” she said.







Beyond domestic policy, the US approach to the war in Gaza and soaring tensions in the Middle East is proving to be a prominent issue in this election cycle.

While governors do not dictate foreign policy, Walz hasexpressed support for Israeland ordered the flags at half-staff in solidarity with the US ally after Hamas’s October 7 attack.

While serving in Congress, Walz had also taken pro-Israel positions.

“Israel is our truest and closest ally in the region, with a commitment to values of personal freedoms and liberties, surrounded by a pretty tough neighborhood,” he had said in 2010.

But in March, afternearly 19 percentof Democratic voters in Minnesota cast “uncommitted” votes to protest President Joe Biden’s unconditional support for Israel, Walz suggested that he understands the growing frustration with the US approach.

He said peoplewho voted“uncommitted” have “every right” to be heard.

“These folks are asking for a change in course. They’re asking for more pressure to be put on,” Walz told MPR News at that time.

“People are frustrated, but it bodes well for me that they’re actively engaged to go out and cast his vote and ask for change,” he said.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is projected to lose a segment of her party’s traditional share of Indian American voters – who have historically sided with the Democrats – in the 2024 United States election, a new survey of the community’s political attitudes has found.

Even though Harris could become the first ever Indian American president of the US, asurveyby the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has found that she is likely to secure fewer votes from the community than incumbent President Joe Biden did in 2020.









An estimated 61 percent of respondents from the community will vote for Harris, the survey found, down by nearly 4 percent as compared to the last presidential election in 2020.

The 5.2 million-strong Indian American community is the second-largest immigrant bloc in the US after Mexican Americans, with an estimated 2.6 million voters eligible for casting a ballot for the November 5 election.

There has been a decline in the community’s attachment to Harris’s party as well, with 47 percent of respondents identifying as Democrats, down from 56 percent in 2020. Meanwhile, the researchers noted “a modest shift in the community’s preferences”, with a slight uptick in willingness to vote for the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.

Both parties have ramped up their outreach to the immigrant group in the last few years as the community continues to grow its political clout and influence. While Harris is today the face of the party, several Indian Americans have gained prominence on the Republican side too – from former presidential contender and ex-ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley to entrepreneur-turned-Trump surrogate Vivek Ramaswamy, and vice-presidential nominee JD Vance’s wife, Usha Vance.

Four days before November 5, pollsters say the election is too close to call, with Harris’s national edge over Trump shrinking, according to FiveThirtyEight’s poll tracker. And in all seven battleground states – Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada – the two candidates are separated by less than 2 percentage points, within the margin of error for polls.

The result of the presidential race may come down to a few thousand votes in these crucial swing states, where smaller communities – like Indian Americans – could play a pivotal role, political analysts and observers told Al Jazeera.

“Even though the Indian American community is not very big in absolute numbers, they can help swing the decision in one direction or another,” said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and co-author of the paper. “There are many states where the community’s population is larger than the margin of victory in the 2020 presidential election.”

Indian Americans are the largest Asian American community in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan. There are more than 150,000 Indian Americans in both Pennsylvania and Georgia – a number much higher than the margin by which Biden won these two states, with 35 Electoral College votes between them – in 2020.

But why is the community’s vote drifting away from Democrats?

For Aishwarya Sethi, a 39-year-old Indian American voter based in California, Harris’spitchto reclaim abortion rights in the country strikes a chord, she told Al Jazeera. But her husband, who works at a tech company in the state, she said, is increasingly tilting towards the Republican base. “I cannot understand why his politics is shifting but it is happening gradually,” she said. “I’ll still try to convince him to vote for greater sexual autonomy.”

This gender-based partisan divide is reflected in several research papers and leading exit polls across the US. Within the Indian American community, as per the latest survey, 67 percent of women intend to vote for Harris while 53 percent of men, a smaller share, plan to vote for the vice president.

“Reproductive freedom is a paramount concern for women across America, including South Asian women and the [female] support for Harris is not surprising given her position on abortion rights,” said Arjun Sethi, an Indian American lawyer based in Washington, DC.

“Whereas a growing number of South Asian men favour strong border policies and a more friendly taxation regime, [therefore] aligning with Trump.”

A closer look at the data reveals that the gender gap is starkest with younger voters.

A majority of men and women above the age of 40 say they plan to pick Harris. Among voters below the age of 40, however, the male vote is split almost equally between Harris and Trump, while women overwhelmingly support Harris.

“There is also a growing scepticism among some Indian American men voting for a female president,” added Vaishnav, co-author of the paper. The deepening gender gap in voting preference among the immigrant community is “a new cleavage that didn’t exist before, however, [it] is in line with the larger national trend in the US”.

Trump’s tougher stance on “illegal and undocumented immigration and a very aggressive populist, nationalist politics” may find resonance among a segment of Indian American voters, said Sangay Mishra, an associate professor of international relations, with a specialisation in immigrants’ political incorporation, at Drew University.

“This pitch is primarily aimed at white voters but also trickles down to minorities, especially among men.”

However, at the same time, Mishra warns against reading too much into the reported shift in the survey. “This paper captures the dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party but it does not necessarily mean greater identification with the Republican Party,” he said, “because within the Indian American community, the Republicans are still associated with the Christian, or white, nationalist position”.

Harris’s mother was born in India and migrated to the US in 1958 for graduate studies at the University of California Berkeley, while her father is Black with Jamaican roots. The Democratic candidate has also identified herself as a Black woman in multiple instances.

That identification with African American roots, rather than more openly embracing her Indian background, has also pushed away a few voters in the South Asian community, said Rohit Chopra, a professor of communication at Santa Clara University. “There is actually more enthusiasm for someone like Tulsi Gabbard or Usha Vance, than for Kamala Harris [in the Indian American community],” he said. “In the American mainstream, Harris is perceived as African American.”

This “strategic decision” by her campaign is also driven by numbers, Chopra added. “The ‘Indianness’ does not have the same trade-off value [like Black voters], it’s strategically not worth it for them.”

As per the new survey, Indian Americans (61 percent) are less inclined to vote for Harris than Black voters (77 percent), and marginally more so than Hispanic Americans (58 percent). However, Harris’s support is down among Black and Latino voters too, compared to the norm for the Democratic Party.

Within the Indian American community, Harris’s position as a more liberal leader appeals to 26 percent of voters as compared to 7 percent who say they are enthusiastic about her Indian heritage. Meanwhile, 12 percent of the respondents in the survey said that they are less enthusiastic about the Democratic ticket because “Harris identifies more with her Black roots”.

There are other worrying signs for Democrats too: The number of Indian Americans who identify themselves as Democrats has dropped to 47 percent in 2024, down by nine points from 56 percent in 2020.

Meanwhile, 21 percent identify themselves as Republicans – the same as in 2020 – while the percentage of Indian Americans who identify as independents has grown, up to 26 percent from 15 percent.

One reason for this shift, say experts, is Israel’s war on Gaza, in which more than 43,000 people have been killed, and President Joe Biden’s administration’s steadfast support for Israel.

Earlier in the year, more than 700,000 Americans voted “uncommitted” in state primaries as a message to Biden, the then-Democrat nominee, that he would lose significant support on the November 5 election day. As perrecent polls, Trump is narrowly leading Harris among Arab Americans with a lead of 45 percent to 43 percent among the key demographic.

“A large number of young people, particularly young Indian Americans, are disillusioned with the stance that the Democrats have taken on Gaza,” said Mishra of Drew University. “There is a lot of conversation about uncommitted voters, or giving a protest vote, to show that people are unhappy with what’s happening in Gaza – and that is influencing at least a section of Indian Americans.”

Sethi, the Indian American lawyer based in DC, added that he is confident that “a growing number of younger South Asians are voting for a third-party candidate because they are deeply committed to ending the genocide in Gaza, and therefore refuse to vote for either Trump or Harris”.

Multiple immigration experts and political analysts have said that a slight shift among the Indian American community towards Trump is also driven by his apparent friendship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist leader.

In a message on Diwali, the Indian festival of light on Thursday, Trump tried to woo the Hindu American vote.

“I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,” he said on X. “It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America.”

“We will also protect Hindu Americans against the anti-religion agenda of the radical left. We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi.”

However, Vaishnav, the co-author of the paper, claimed that it is a rather “common misperception that Indian Americans tend to vote in the presidential elections based on their assessment of US-India ties”.

Vaishnav added that the last two surveys, in 2020 and 2024, on the political attitude of the community reveal that “foreign policy may be important to Indian Americans, but it is not a defining election issue” because of a bipartisan consensus that the US and India should grow together.

Instead, the voters are more motivated by daily concerns like prices, jobs, healthcare, climate change and reproductive rights, Vaishnav said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/us-election-why-is-kamala-harris-losing-indian-american-voters,NEGATIVE,0.9974506497383118
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump,are targeting key swing statesin a final push to win over undecided voters as they continue to crisscross the United States before Tuesday’s election.

The two contenders, who are locked in a tight race for the White House, will host duelling rallies on Friday night about 10km (6 miles) from one another in Milwaukee, the largest city in the battleground state of Wisconsin.









Milwaukee is home to the most Democratic votes in the state, but its conservative suburbs are where most Republicans live and are a critical area for Trump as he tries to reclaim the state he narrowly won in 2016 and lost in 2020.

Four of the past six presidential elections in Wisconsin have been decided by less than 1 percentage point, or fewer than 23,000 votes, and the race is just as tight this time around.

After appearing with music star Jennifer Lopez at a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday, Harris will tap musicians such as GloRilla, the Isley Brothers and Flo Milli in Milwaukee. Grammy award-winning rapper Cardi B, who has more than 200 million followers on social media platforms, was also due to speak at the campaign event.

Trump, meanwhile, will return to the Fiserv Forum, the venue where in July he formally accepted his party’s presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention.

Earlier, he made a campaign stop in Michigan, in the Detroit suburb ofDearborn, home to a large Arab American community.







Asked why Dearborn was important to him, the former president said: “We have a great feeling for Lebanon, and I know so many people from Lebanon, Lebanese people and the Muslim population [like] Trump, and I’ve a good relationship with them.”

He said: “We want their votes. We’re looking for their votes, and I think we’ll get their votes.”

Trump also disparaged Harris and claimed if elected to the White House again, “we’re going to have peace in the Middle East”.

In comments that echoed claims he has made about ending the conflict in Ukraine, he said bringing peace to the Middle East was possible “but not with the clowns you have running the US right now”.

Opinion polls, both nationally and in the seven closely divided battleground states, suggest the two candidates are virtually tied with four days to go before election day. More than 66 million people have already cast early ballots.

Trump has focused his campaign on stirring fears about violence he blames on immigrants and pessimism over the economy. The former president continues to falsely claim his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud in multiple states, and he and his supporters have spread baseless claims about this election in the key state of Pennsylvania.

On Thursday, Trump stepped up his unfounded allegations that probes into suspect voter registration forms are proof of voter fraud. Some of his supporters also alleged voter suppression when long lines formed this week to receive mail-in ballots.

“This is sowing the seeds for attempts to overturn an election,” said Kyle Miller, a strategist with the advocacy group Protect Democracy. “We saw it in 2020, and I think the lesson Trump and his allies have learned since is that they have to sow these ideas early.”

State officials and democracy advocates said the incidents show a system working as intended. A judge extended the mail-in ballot deadline by three days in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, after the Trump campaign sued over claims that some voters were turned away before a Tuesday deadline.



Election officials discovered potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster and neighbouring York counties, prompting investigations by local law enforcement. There is no evidence the applications have resulted in illegal votes.

“This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,” Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania’s top election official, told reporters this week.

Harris, meanwhile, is running on warnings about an authoritarian takeover, pledging to help the middle class and pushing back against Republican abortion bans and restrictions.

An issue top of mind for voters is the economy, with many complaining about inflation and wages that do not keep up with rising prices.

Economists said the US economy is actually in robust shape, shrugging off the remaining impact of the coronavirus pandemic with low unemployment and strong growth. New figures on Friday, however, showed drastically lower job growth last month with only 12,000 new jobs created.

Analysts largely attributed this to knock-on effects from hurricanes and a strike at the aerospace giant Boeing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/1/kamala-harris-donald-trump-rallying-in-wisconsin-in-final-us-election-push,POSITIVE,0.9935378432273865
Kamala Harris,US Vice President Kamala Harris in Africa to boost ties,"Vice President Kamala Harris has said that the United States will increase investment in Africa and help spur economic growth as she began a week-long tour of the continent aimed at countering the influence of rivals Russia and China.

China has invested heavily in Africa in recent decades, including in infrastructure and resource development, while Russian influence has also grown, including through the deployment of troops from the private military contractorWagner Groupin several countries.

“On this trip, I intend to do work that is focused on increasing investments here on the continent and facilitating economic growth and opportunity,” Harris said on Sunday shortly after touching down in Ghana, the first destination in a trip that will include visits to Tanzania and Zambia.

“We are looking forward to this trip as a further statement of the long and enduring very important relationship and friendship between the people of the United States and those who live on this continent,” Harris said.

The administration of President Joe Biden has sought to strengthen ties with Africa, in part to offer an alternative to rival powers, amid global competition over the continent’s future.

African nationsare aware that there are ulterior motives for this push for a closer alliance, observers say.

“African nations are not naive … The US has a long history of meddling in African affairs, supporting dictators versus liberation movements, pushing hard for US multinationals’ access to African markets and resources, while leaving countries with nothing,” said Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi, reporting from Washington, DC.

“So the US is saying, ‘That’s all in the past now, we are partners, we can all be successful’, whereas what we’re hearing from Africa is, ‘We don’t want to choose between China, Russia and the US, but we will do what we feel is in our best interest.'”

In December, ahead of the US-Africa Leaders Summit, Washington committed $55bn to the continent over the next three years.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinkenannounced $150m in new humanitarian aid for Africa’s Sahel region during a visit toNigerthis month, which came less than a year after he visited South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,Morocco, Algeria and Rwanda.

Thisflurry of diplomacyis “about the geopolitical struggles that are going on, and the fear in Washington that it’s losing ground, specifically now in Africa where there is a scramble for resources, where there are rarer minerals to power the Green Revolution, and so on”, Rattansi said.

Harris will meet Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo this week and will visit a castle from which people were forcibly sent to the US during the slave trade era.

Harris will be in Ghana from March 26-29, then in Tanzania from March 29-31. Her final stop is Zambia, on March 31 and April 1. She will meet with the three countries’ presidents and plans to announce public- and private-sector investments.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/26/us-vice-president-harris-in-africa-to-boost-us-ties,POSITIVE,0.997657060623169
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"It was Kamala Harris’s first public speech afterincumbent Joe Biden withdrewfrom the United States presidential race — and the vice president spent much of it hailing her boss.

“Joe Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history,”Harris told a crowdassembled on the White House lawn on July 22, a day after Biden dropped his re-election bid.

“In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office.”

In the weeks since she made those comments, Harris has been confirmed as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. She has alsonamed a running matein Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and her campaign has injected enthusiasm into what had been a largely lacklustre election season.

Yet despite Harris’s praise that day at the White House, Biden has largely been absent from her campaign so far — prompting questions about whether his presence on the trail will help, or hinder, her efforts to win the presidency.

“I think Joe Biden will be a sounding board if asked by the Harris campaign,” said Tatishe Nteta, the provost professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and director of the UMass Amherst Poll.

He said Biden, who ran a successful presidential campaign in 2020 and spent decades in Congress, will be able to offer advice on “how to both effectively and efficiently leverage” his experience, including by using his connections across key states.

But Nteta told Al Jazeera he doesn’t think it strategically makes “much sense to put Biden up front in the American people again. I don’t see the benefit.”







Biden, who dropped out of the race amid questions about his age and cognitive ability, said last weekend that he plans to campaign for Harris in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. He narrowly edged out his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in the state in 2020, effectively winning him the White House.

“I’m going to be campaigning in other states, as well. I’m going to be doing whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most,”the US president told CBS Newson Sunday.

Biden is also set to speak on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, which runs from August 19 to 22 in Chicago.

He will no doubt use that address to heap praise on Harris while also touting the successes of his administration, including the passage of major pieces of legislation such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and theInflation Reduction Act.

But Biden has also been widely criticised on a number of issues during his term, from the surge in the number of migrants and asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border tohis staunch supportfor Israel as it wages war in the Gaza Strip.

He remains a target of attacks by Republican lawmakers and Trump, the GOP’s 2024 presidential candidate — and some of their anti-Biden talking points have shifted to Harris in the wake of her presidential bid.

Republicans have particularly slammed her record on immigration, falsely dubbing her the administration’s “border czar”. In reality, she had no authority over the border but was tasked with addressing the “root causes” of migration to the US from parts of Central America and Mexico.

Harris also has faced sustained protests from key segments of the Democratic Party base over the administration’s Israel policy. Advocates have publicly urged her to back an arms embargo against the top US ally in response to its deadly military attacks across Gaza.

“I thinkthe genocide in Gazathat’s been going on has been a real tarnish on Biden’s legacy,” said Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairperson for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party.

As a result, having Biden on the campaign trail risks hurting Harris, Pyarali told Al Jazeera. He said he believes Harris should make a clear break from Biden’s stance on Israel.

“I think, in this case, that she has a really rare chance in politics to rebrand and take on a new identity as more progressive, as more youth-minded.”







But both Pyarali and Nteta said that — while the Harris campaign has been able to build strong momentum in its first weeks, thanks in part to a strong social media presence — it will need to go beyond rhetoric and lay out clear policies to appeal to voters.

“She has been putting out memes, but memes only get you so far,” said Pyarali.

He stressed that this is particularly pivotal with the issue of the Gaza war. Pyarali said that Harris must break fromBiden on Gaza“and call not just for a ceasefire but an arms embargo on Israel until this war is over”.

On Tuesday, the Biden administrationannouncedit had approved the potential sale of more than $20bn in weapons to Israel, drawing fresh rebuke.

“Short of a policy change, you’re going to run up a lot of the same issues that Joe Biden did,” Pyarali said. “She has a chance here to really unite the party behind a new progressive vision for peace, and I hope she takes it.”

Nteta said he believes Harris should still highlight the Biden administration’s successes and her role in them, but she likely intends to strike out her own in order to appeal to Americans who had been frustrated with their previous options in the presidential race.

Biden had originally been set to take on Trump — whom he defeated in 2020 — in what one political science expert haddubbed“Election 2.0”, effectively a “rematch” between the two men.

But voters had signalled limited enthusiasm for the options. A Pew Research Centerpoll from Aprilindicated nearly half of all registered voters would have replaced both Biden and Trump on the ballot if they could.

In early August, a UMass Amherst poll found 66 percent of respondents who backed Harris’s candidacy said they did so because she “represents a new generation”. If elected, Harris would be the first woman and the first Black and South Asian woman to serve as US president.

“People are looking for something distinct, something new,” said Nteta.

Harris, he added, will soon need to “start articulating what her policy positions are rather than just overarching positivity, enthusiasm and energy”.

“I think defining who she is, is necessary,” he told Al Jazeera, “because at this point in time, Americans are really responding to vibes and not necessarily to policy.”

Kamala Harris,Harris skirts question on whether Israel’s Netanyahu is ‘close ally’ of US,"USVice President Kamala Harrishas skirted a question on whether Benjamin Netanyahu can be considered a “close ally” of the United States, as critics accuse the Israeli prime minister of stymying Washington’s stated goal of de-escalation in the Middle East.

In an excerpt of an interview with CBS News’s 60 Minutes, which was released on Sunday, Harris was pressed on what the US is doing to get its top ally to end its military offensive in the Gaza Strip and stop its attacks on Lebanon.

Harris, the Democratic candidate in November’s presidential election, said the US has been applying pressure on Israel – as well as on Arab leaders in the region – to reacha Gaza ceasefire dealand would continue to do so.

“The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel,” she said, without providing details.

Harris was then asked if the United States had a “real, close ally” in Netanyahu.

“I think, with all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is ‘yes’,” she replied.

The exchange highlights the continued refusal byUS President Joe Biden’s administrationto change tack and curtail its staunch support for Netanyahu’s government as the Israeli military bombards the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.

— 60 Minutes (@60Minutes)October 6, 2024



For months, analysts have accused Netanyahu of holding up a possible Gaza ceasefire agreement for his own political purposes.

Observers also warned that Washington’s failure to pressure Israel to end the Gaza war would push the Middle East towards a wider regional conflict – and rights advocates had urged the Biden administration to imposean arms embargoon the Israeli government.

Washington provides Israel with at least $3.8bn in military aid annually, and Biden has greenlit $14bn in additional assistance to the US ally since Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip began in October of last year.

To date, more than 41,800 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza.

At least 1,100 people also have been killed in Lebanon since the Israeli military – which had been trading fire with Lebanese group Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border for months – recentlyescalated its bombardmentof the country.

Amid the mounting violence, the Biden administration has repeatedly said it favours diplomacy and wants to see a de-escalation. But senior US officials have also said they support Israel’s “right to defend itself”.

“Obviously attacks, targeted attacks on civilians, could not be justified, but Israel does have the right to go after terrorists,” US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters last week, when asked about deadly Israeli bombings in Lebanon.

“They need to take actions to mitigate civilian harm. They’re required to do that under international humanitarian law, in Lebanon as they are anywhere else,” Miller added.







But critics say such statements have little effect on the actions of Netanyahu’s right-wing government, as the Biden administration has refused to condition US military and diplomatic support for Israel.

“President Biden has spent a year enabling the Israeli government’s expanding war crimes,violating US lawsthat require an arms embargo on Israel, and ignoring the majority of Americans who oppose sending more weapons to Israel,” the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in a statement on Sunday.

“Now the entire region is in chaos.”

The Biden administration’s policy has come under renewed criticism as tensions have escalated in recent days between Israel and Iran.

Last week, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)fired a barrage of ballistic missilesat Israel in what it said was an act of retaliation for killings in Lebanon and Gaza, as well as the assassinations of top Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian leaders.

Netanyahu has said Iran would “pay” for the attack, raising fears that Israel could strike strategic sites in the country such as Iranian nuclear facilities.

Asked by reporters last Wednesday whether he would back an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites,Biden said“the answer is ‘no'”.

The US president told reporters that any Israeli response should be “proportional”, without elaborating on what that means exactly.

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will host his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant in Washington, DC, on October 9 to “discuss ongoing Middle East security developments”, a Pentagon spokesman said on Sunday.

Kamala Harris,Harris to Modi: ‘Incumbent on our nations to protect democracies’,"As democracies around the world are under threat, “it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our respective countries,” US Vice President Kamala Harris has told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“I know from personal experience and from my family of the commitment of the Indian people to democracy, and the work that needs to be done (so that) we can begin to imagine, and then actually achieve, our vision for democratic principles and institutions,” Harris said in public remarks made during a meeting on Thursday between the two leaders.

The remarks marked a subtle departure from the Trump administration’s approach towards the Hindu nationalist Modi, who has presided over an increase in religious polarisation in his country, with more laws discriminating against religious minorities, mainly its large Muslim population, as well as attacks on non-Hindus.

Harris, whose mother was born in India, is the first United States vice president of Indian descent. She is also the first woman and first Black person to hold the second-most powerful office in the country.

Her 15-minute public meeting with Modi was cheered by a large contingent of Indian reporters and a crowd of Indian Americans, who number more than four million in the US.

Despite the mild pressure, the two leaders shared warm words, including praise from Harris for India’s role in producing coronavirus vaccines for the world.

“On COVID-19, our nations have worked together. Early in the pandemic, India was a vital source of vaccines for other countries,” she said. “And I welcome India’s announcement that it will soon be able to resume vaccine exports.”

India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, announced earlier this week that it wouldresume exportsto other nations after stopping in April to focus on inoculating its own population.

Modi thanked Harris for offering a “sense of kinship” in a phone call during his country’s deadly coronavirus surge this spring.

He invited Harris to visit his country, telling her that Indians “are waiting to welcome you” and calling her “the source of inspiration for so many people across the world”.

“I am completely confident that under President Biden and your leadership, our bilateral relationship will reach new heights,” said the Indian leader.







India has become a closer US ally in recent years as Washington, DC recognises the South Asian country’s strategic importance in countering China’s growing military and financial powers.

Modi is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden on Friday and then separately again with Harris and Biden in meetings of the so-called Quad, which also includes Japan and Australia.

The gathering of the leaders from Australia, India, Japan and the US comes on the heels of Biden dealing with backlash from France after he announced that the US, with the assistance of Britain, would equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.

Modi on Thursday also met the chief executives of Qualcomm, Blackstone, Adobe, First Solar and General Atomics, according to media reports.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Soon after Kamala Harris and Donald Trump left the Philadelphia stage following theUnited States presidential debate, musicianTaylor Swiftthrew her support behind Harris.

Swift posted a picture of herself and her pet cat on Tuesday night with a lengthy caption explaining why she will be voting for Democrat Harris and her running mate,Tim Walz.

The endorsement came after months of fevered speculation over whether and when Swift, arguably the biggest name in the world of music, would publicly pick a candidate in the US election.

But could Swift’s support really make a difference andbring more votesto Harris? Here’s more about the role of celebrity endorsements in US elections.

In the caption of her Instagram post on Tuesday, Swift began by saying she watchedthe debate, urging her 284 million followers to do their research on the key issues and candidates before the November 5 election. “As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies,” she wrote.

She then expressed fears around themisuse of artificial intelligenceto spread misinformation. In August, Trump, on his online platform Truth Social,posted AI-generated imagesof Swift and her fans appearing to endorse Trump. Some of these AI deep fakes showed her fans wearing T-shirts with the text “Swifties for Trump”.

These images caused Swift to conclude she needed to “be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter”, she continued in her caption before declaring that she would be voting for Harris and Walz. She added that she was heartened by Harris’s choice of Walz as her vice presidential candidate because of his long advocacy for “IVF and a woman’s right to her own body”.

She signed off as “Childless Cat Lady”, a wry nod to Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, who had previously used the phrase to describe emerging leaders within theDemocratic Party, including Harris.

While some polls show that people say they are not influenced by celebrity endorsements, nonprofits and other organisations have reported increased voter participation after celebrities weigh in on a political race, according to a study by Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government that was published in August.

An example of this is Swift herself. In September 2023, she sent out a post urging her followers to register themselves as voters on Vote.org. After this, the nonpartisan, nonprofit organisation recorded more than 35,000 voter registrations. While it was unclear how many of these registrations came from Swift fans, Vote.org reported a 1,226 percent increase in participation in the hour after Swift’s post.

According to the Harvard study, directing fans to register as voters is a common call to action among celebrities. In 2020, YouTube vlogger David Dobrik and, in 2022, model and socialite Hailey Bieber ran online campaigns urging their followers to verify their voter registration status. Both campaigns were successful.

A celebrity endorsement “won’t impact voters who already have strong partisan allegiances, and most voters are in this category”, Richard T Longoria, an associate professor of US government and politics at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, said.

Longoria, who specialises in celebrity politics and public opinion, added that a small segment of voters can be influenced by such endorsements. “People that are disengaged from the political process or are discovering political issues for the first time can be influenced,” he said.

“In a close election, that could mean the difference between winning and losing,” Longoria said.

But in terms of celebrity endorsements impacting voter turnout for specific candidates, no modern example comes close to the advantage Barack Obama gleaned from the support he won from the queen of talk shows: Oprah Winfrey.

In 2007, Democrat Barack Obama announced his presidential bid for the2008 electionand was backed byOprah, one of the most influential television hosts and producers in history.

This was when Obama was still competing against fellow Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to be the party’s presidential nominee.

Apollby the Pew Research Center published in September 2007 showed 69 percent of respondents said Oprah’s endorsement would likely have no impact on their vote. However, 23 percent of Democrats said they were more likely to vote for the candidate of Oprah’s choice.

A study by economists Craig Garthwaite of Northwestern University and Timothy J Moore from the University of Maryland found that Oprah’s endorsement resulted in about one million additional votes for Obama.

In addition to higher voter turnout, her support also helped Obama secure more funds for his campaign, according to the 2013 study. Obama won the 2008 election with nearly 53 percent of the popular vote.

For decades, celebrities in the US have been vocal about their support for politicians, adding stardust to campaigns.

While data on the impact of this support are limited, some pop culture icons have done more than lend their names.

Frank Sinatra didn’t just endorse DemocratJohn F Kennedy’s1960 campaign, he also raised funds and worked the phones, using his inimitable baritone to woo voters in support of his candidate. By the 1970s, though, the Fly Me to the Moon singer had flipped to the other side, supporting Republican Ronald Reagan, a fellow Hollywood star.

In the 1960 election, Judy Garland, the singer and star of The Wizard of Oz, also supported Kennedy and was seen next to him at the Democratic National Convention that year. In 2008, singer Barbra Streisand supportedHillary Clinton’scampaign. She had also supported Bill Clinton’s 1996 bid.

It’s mixed: If the past is any guide, her support is no guarantor of success.

In 2018, she endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen in his Tennessee Senate race against Republican Marsha Blackburn by posting an Instagram story to her then-112 million followers.

Swift has lived in Nashville, the capital of the heavily Republican state, since she was 14.

Vote.org reported that within 24 hours after she posted her story, the group saw 65,000 new voter registrations. Within three days, the number of registrations rose by an additional 250,000. Again, while it was unclear how many of these registrations came from Swift fans, this was record engagement for Vote.org.

Her 2020 documentary, Miss Americana, features a clip of her tearfully explaining to her parents why she wanted to publicly endorse Bredesen. This video was taken before she went ahead with posting the Instagram story.

“I need to be on the right side of history,” Swift said, adding, “It really is a big deal to me.” She explained that this was because Blackburn “votes against fair pay for women, votes against the reauthorisation of the Violence Against Women Act, which is just protecting us from domestic abuse and stalking”.

Bredesen lost to Blackburn, who won 54.7 percent of the vote.

However, she endorsed Biden in October 2020, andhe wonthe 2020 election with 51.3 percent of the popular vote.

Here is a look at some of the celebrities endorsing eitherTrump or Harrisin this presidential campaign.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again (MAGA)” movement is a macho cult. It suggests the US can be “great again” only if modern American men learn to be strong “manly men” like their fathers and grandfathers, assert dominance over “their” women, and “take back control” – whatever that means. It encourages men to hide their feelings, adhere to archaic sex stereotypes, use violence to get ahead in life, and take advice not from experts and loved ones, but so so-called famous “alpha males”, like podcaster Joe Rogan or billionaire X owner (and now leading Trump backer) Elon Musk.

This toxic movement, built on a promise to return America to an imagined golden era when women knew their place and thus life was jolly for everyone, has unfortunately set the tone for the upcoming presidential elections in the world’s strongest nation. We are now living in a reality where millions and millions of American men (and a not-at-all-small number of women) appear to see Donald Trump as the epitome of male strength, and him being elected president for a second time as the only answer to the country’s many problems.









The former president and reality TV star has a history of insulting and belittling women on social media and on television. He routinely makes crude and offensive comments about prominent women, and especially women who publicly talk against him at his televised rallies attended by thousands. He criticises their physical appearance, insults their families, and even their reproductive choices. At least 26 women have accused him of sexual misconduct and assault. These allegations go all the way back to the 1970s and include rape, unwanted kissing, groping, and voyeurism.  Last year, a jury in a civil trial found him liable for sexual assault and rewarded his accuser $5m. Trump denies all accusations, but nevertheless, his disdain for women is obvious to anyone paying an iota of attention to his words and conduct. Even his VP pick, JD Vance, is an open misogynist, who insults their Democratic rivals by calling them “childless cat ladies”. As president, Trump appointed the judges who eventually overturned Roe v Wade and left American women in many states without meaningful control over their bodies and lives.

In a sane world, this track record of misogyny and violent machismo would be enough to ensure Trump has no chance of coming anywhere near the White House ever again. But we are not living in a sane world.

The MAGA movement has framed the entire election around stereotypes about masculinity. They claimed everything is down to physical endurance, willingness to inflict violence on enemies, and being an overall “macho man”, and seemingly managed to convince enough people to have a good chance at winning this election.

What does this tell us about American society?

In the past few months, we have repeatedly seen Trump’s leading rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, being attacked not over her policy positions and conduct in office, but her “sexual history”. She has been accused of being “promiscuous” in her youth and having had “slept her way to the top”. Conservative commentator and filmmaker Matt Walsh posted on X that Harris had “made a career out of begging for handouts from powerful men”, and Fox News host Megyn Kelly described these comments as being helpful to voters, and perfectly “fair game”. Of course, these are nothing but unsubstantiated rumours – the time-old story of baseless gossip being weaponised against a successful woman. And even if they were true, her personal relationship history would not have any impact on how Harris would do the job, or set her apart from Trump – a known serial adulterer and abuser of women who got where he is in life thanks to family money and connections.

Beyond run-of-the-mill misogyny focused on alleged promiscuity, Trump’s “macho” supporters have also accused Harris of being a “home wrecker” (due to a past relationship with a man who at the time was separated, but not yet divorced, from his wife); of actually being a man who transitioned to live as a woman (this one is hard to decipher, but perhaps the suggestion is that she would not have been this successful in politics if she was a natural-born woman?); and of “not having a stake in the future of the country” due to her not having any biological children. Harris, the only child of a couple of first-generation Black and South Asian immigrants, has also been accused of not being Black enough (because she is half South Asian), not being South Asian enough (because she is half Black!) and not being American enough (because she was born to immigrant parents).

Overall, throughout the campaign season, the MAGA movement seemed to be making the case that Harris should not be elected president because as a woman, she is morally, physically and emotionally weak and not equipped to lead the “strong and manly” American nation at this moment of crisis and hardship.

Looking at the current Trump campaign’s apparent success – despite all his scandals and 34 criminal convictions, Trump remains neck and neck with Harris in all the latest polls – and his shocking 2016 victory against the political powerhouse that is Hillary Clinton, some began to suggest that maybe America is not yet ready – and will never be ready – to elect a woman as leader.

While these pessimists are undoubtedly right about the misogyny and sexism of the US society, and the uphill battle female candidates face in American politics, they seem to be ignoring two important facts. One, Clinton, who carried much heavier political baggage than Harris, despite losing the Electoral College, won the popular vote in 2016. And two, this year, despite all the misogyny, the slurs and the insults, Kamala Harris is not at all behind in the polls, and has a very real chance of winning this election.

Sure, a majority of men (especially white men) seem to be supporting Trump’s machismo and showing up for him (an October poll by Economist/YouGov showed that Trump has a massive 52 percent to 43 percent lead over Harris among male voters). But women, who are well aware of how damaging four years of Trump has been to their rights, are also showing up for Harris. According to a recent poll by the Harvard Institute of Politics, Harris leads amongst women 18-29 by a whopping 30 points. In battleground states like Arizona and Michigan, tens of thousands of women, and especially young women, are known to have voted early to ensure a Harris victory.

So, a woman can still take over the White House in the near future. If Harris wins the election and becomes the first female president of the United States, however, American misogyny that Trump exposed, took advantage of, and deepened, will not disappear overnight.

Just as the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 did not mark the end of racism in American society, the possible election of Harris in 2024 will not end misogyny and sexism in the country.

This is partly because Kamala Harris is no true feminist.

The Democratic vice president panders to transgender ideology. She appears willing to allow men who say they are women to trample upon the hard-earned sex-based rights of women in the name of “inclusivity”. She is supportive of so-called “gender-affirming” medical interventions, which needlessly maim physically healthy women and girls, and often turn them into life-long medical patients. She is the first mainstream US presidential candidate to support the blanket decriminalisation of prostitution (which she refers to as “sex work”). In many ways, Harris is no friend to women, either. And, sadly, she may be acting this way because she believes true feminism cannot win an American election.

But, even if Harris, for whatever reason, cannot seem to define what a woman is, Trump most certainly can. In his bigoted, misogynistic mind, women are sexual playthings, mothers and carers, and not full human beings with rights, opinions and freedoms.

This is why, if I were an American, I would not hesitate to vote for Harris over Trump despite all my misgivings about her feminist credentials.

We will find out, in a matter of days, whether enough Americans of all sexes concerned about women’s rights reach the same conclusion, show up at the polls to support Harris and manage to put an end to the misogyny fest that has been Trump’s political career.

But whatever political reality we wake up to on November 6, this election season – and the misogyny, hate and violence against women it normalised – will have consequences. Going forward, women will be more scared to put themselves forward for public office, knowing the harassment and lies they will have to face merely for being a woman seeking power and authority. The abuse Harris endured in the past few months, not for her politics but her sex, has proved America is not yet a feminist nation, and it is definitely not ready to elect a true feminist as leader.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"US Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has accused her Republican rival Donald Trump of being a threat to democracy, as the pair held duelling rallies in thecritical battleground state of Pennsylvania.

Harrisand Trump addressed their respective supporters on Monday evening, with Harris speaking in the city of Erie and Trump hosting a town hall in Oaks, a suburb northwest of Philadelphia.

“A second Trump term would be a huge risk for America – and dangerous. Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged,” Harris told the crowd, referencing recent comments in which Trump warned that the United States faced an “enemy from within”.

Trump has leaned intoincreasingly incendiary rhetoricas the race for the White House heats up ahead of the November 5 vote.

The former president has adopteddehumanising rhetoric about immigrants, and he also recently suggested the country faced internal enemies who could be addressed with military force.

“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” he told Fox News in an interview that aired at the weekend when asked about potential chaos on Election Day. “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.”







He added: “It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by [the] National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military.”

Trump also has previously shared content on his social media platform suggesting that his political opponents were traitors who should face military tribunals.

For years, Democrats have sought to portray Trump as a threat to US democracy, particularly after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 election results.

President Joe Biden – who defeated Trump in that 2020 vote –said last yearthat the ex-president’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign was an “extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs in our democracy”.

But recent polls suggest Trump and Harris are locked inan extremely tight racefor the White House, less than a month before the election.

In recent weeks, Harris has been on a media blitz as her campaign pushes to appeal to key segments of the Democratic base, includingBlack menas well asArab and Muslim Americanswho have shown waning support for the candidate.

At her rally on Monday, she showed clips of Trump’s most recent comments as she warned against electing him to another term.

“He considers anyone who doesn’t support him, or who will not bend to his will, an enemy of our country,” the US vice president said.

Polling averages show Harris with anarrow leadof less than 1 percent in Pennsylvania, a northeastern state that could prove critical in the upcoming election.







For his part, during his event in the Pennsylvania town of Oaks, Trump repeated a pledge to increase US oil drilling, which he said would drive down costs though domestic production is already at record highs.

“We’re going to drill baby drill. We’re going to have so much energy and we’re going to bring prices down,” Trump said.

After medical incidents in the crowd interrupted his town hall, the Republican candidate requested that the song Ave Maria be played for the audience.

“Those two people who went down are patriots,” Trump said afterwards. “We love them. And because of them, we ended up with some great music, right?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/15/harris-slams-trump-in-pennsylvania-as-us-election-race-heats-up,NEGATIVE,0.9835769534111023
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"“What you’re going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025, that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again,” Vice President Kamala Harris warned the audience at the beginning of the first and possibly last debate with her opponent, former President Donald Trump.

Trump responded that he had “nothing to do” with it – a claim journalists and pundits have repeatedly refuted.









Conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023 as a policy framework document for the Republican presidential candidate. Although Trump distanced himself from Project 2025 in July, he endorsed the Heritage Foundation’s work on it while it was still being drafted. “This is a great group, and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do and what your movement will do,” Trump said at a dinner hosted by the foundation in 2022.

From the far-right perspective, Project 2025 stands as a metaphorical Hoover Dam against “the long march of cultural Marxism through our institutions”. The introduction of the 900-page document claims: “The federal government is a behemoth, weaponized against American citizens and conservative values, with freedom and liberty under siege as never before.” The goal of the project is outlined as restoring “[the American] Republic to its original moorings”.

One can be forgiven for thinking that more than 50 conservative think tanks and NGOs getting together to formulate policy for a future president is unprecedented. Yet, Project 2025 is hardly the first time a bunch of far-right Beltway policy wonks have colluded to help set an agenda for a would-be conservative presidency.

If the political class was truly being transparent, they would call this playbook Project 1965, because that is at least how far back the American right started working on resetting progressive policies.

There is certainly much to be outraged about even with a cursory read of Project 2025. Conservative policymakers want to privatise the Transportation Security Agency (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) National Food Insurance Program, the federal housing loan giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and all federal subsidised student loans.

The Project 2025 gurus also long for the elimination of the US Department of Education (DOE) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The DOE’s crime is they are “a convenient one-stop shop for the woke education cartel, which – as the COVID era showed – is not particularly concerned with children’s education. Schools should be responsive to parents, rather than to leftist advocates intent on indoctrination.”

As for NOAA, they are “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and” are “harmful” because of their “fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable”.

If these far-right recommendations are not enough to spark consternation, there is plenty more. Project 2025’s authors also want the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to require states to track all abortions within their borders or threaten those states with “the cutting of funds”.

The CDC’s “abortion surveillance and maternity mortality reporting systems are woefully inadequate”, one Project 2025 author writes, as “liberal states have now become sanctuaries for abortion tourism”. At the same time, he recommends the CDC “immediately end its collection of data on gender identity”, a scientific reality they labelled an “unscientific notion”.

On diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes, critical race theory, and gender identity, Project 2025’s authors write in multiple places about eliminating “social engineering … climate change [mitigation], critical race theory, manufactured extremism, and other polarizing policies”. They refuse to believe that “systemic racism” is a thing.

Yet, as shocking as Project 2025’s prescriptions are, many of them are not new. A great number of them have appeared in the Heritage Foundation-led publication Mandate for Leadership, which has been a mostly quadrennial manual for conservatives since 1981.

Initially, the Heritage Foundation and its collaborators made this playbook available to both the Democratic and Republican parties. With the rise of the conservatives to power, however, the Mandate for Leadership became fully-tuned to centre-right and far-right rule.

There have been nine Mandate for Leadership publications in all for every presidential election cycle since 1980, except for 1992, 2008, and 2012. Even in 1981, conservative policy wonks wanted to “revitalize our economy” through deregulation and massive tax cuts to “strengthen our national security” with beefed-up defence budgets and to “halt the centralization of power in the federal government” by privatising public goods.

The roots of Mandate for Leadership go back even further, to the resistance to the fight for racial justice and civil rights in the 1950s and 60s. The backlash against the Civil Rights Movement helped spark the conservative movement’s rise.

In 1962, as Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater geared up for his eventual run as the Republican nominee for president, he declared, “I don’t like segregation. But I don’t like the Constitution kicked around either.” When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did make its way through Congress, South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond appeared on TV to say he was leaving the Democratic Party for the Republicans. “The Democratic Party has forsaken the people to become the party of minority groups,” Thurmond angrily said.

The stage was set for a merger between the embryonic conservative movement, the Republican Party, and former members of the Democratic Party’s southern wing over their shared opposition to civil rights and other social justice issues. That coalition culminated in Richard Nixon’s successful “Southern Strategy” and appeals to the “silent majority” that won him the presidency in 1968.

Since then, conservative operators have been hard at work infusing their right-wing ideas into many areas of American life. The partial privatisation of the US Postal Service, for example, has been under way for five decades. The authors of the first Mandate for Leadership called for an end to the public “monopoly” of the US Postal Service in 1981.

School choice in the form of public charter schools has become a reality in many school districts across the United States over the past 35 years, which constitutes an indirect sort of privatisation. Restrictions on public money for abortions and contraceptives made their way into federal policies in the 1970s, and the US Supreme Court overturned “the right to privacy” in terms of women’s reproductive rights withthe Dobbs decisiontwo years ago, after decades of increasing legal restrictions.

Even if Harris becomes the 47th president of the US in January, Project 2025, or really, the post-1965 project of making the US a far-right nation-state, will continue unabated. She may be able to stop full implementation at the federal level with Democratic control of the House and the Senate or with her veto power. But she will not be able to stop it at the state level, where so many recommendations from American conservatives are already fully implemented.

On abortion alone, since the Dobbs decision, 14 states have banned abortion entirely, while another 11 have placed restrictions on it, and in three more where there are no legal protections for it. At least 26 states have banned DEI programmes, critical race theory materials, and gender-affirming care in recent years.

Despite far-right complaints about the federal government’s unaccountability in spending US tax dollars on “the Great Awokening” and on a bloated “Administrative State”, the truth is, both Democrats and Republicans at the federal and state levels have kept social welfare spending in austerity mode for decades.

Using “active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen” to patrol the border and arrest “illegal aliens” is also a Project 2025 recommendation, but in fact, both the Trump and Biden administrations have already been implementing this xenophobic policy. And Texas, Tennessee, Florida, and other states have deployed their state National Guards in recent years, albeit in a disorganised fashion.

Harris may be using Project 2025 in her campaign to attack Trump and scare moderates and independents into voting for her, but the far-right project of revealing the US as a place of freedom for a few and fascism for many will continue, even if she wins.

After all, this conservative project has had 60 years to build up its enormous momentum, all too frequently with help from Democrats and centrists like Harris.

Kamala Harris,VP Kamala Harris to rally US allies at Munich security conference,"United States Vice President Kamala Harris will appear at the Munich Security Conference next week to rally European allies against a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, the White House announced on Wednesday.

Harris will give a key speech outlining US policy toward Ukraine and re-asserting America’s commitment to its NATO allies. She will also meet one-on-one with EU and NATO leaders to forge a united front againstRussia’s military build-uparound Ukraine.

The annual conference, organised by Western nations during the Cold War to discuss military conflicts, gathers about 350 senior figures, from dozens of countries at a traditional venue in Germany.

“Munich will demonstrate our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies, reaffirm our shared interest in upholding the principles that have underpinned European peace, and security since World War II and underscore our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” said Sabrina Singh, deputy press secretary for the vice president.

Harris’s trip intensifies US engagement with allies and partners in Europe as Russia continues to amass some100,000 troopsnear the Ukraine border and asserts its naval power. Moscow has denied planning an invasion but US officials said an attack could occur within days or weeks.

SixRussian warshipson Tuesday were headed to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean andRussian forces in Belaruswere preparing to begin 10 days of military drills in a show of strength.

On Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin warned for the second time in a week that European countries would automatically be drawn into a war with Russia in which “there will be no winners” if Ukraine joined NATO and then tried to recapture the Crimean Peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.

President Joe Biden has threatened to impose the mostsevere sanctionsever levied against Russia if it sends troops across the border, but is also emphasising diplomacy as the best way to address Moscow’s stated security concerns.

In ameeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholzon Monday, Biden declared that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that supplies Russian natural gas to Germany would be halted if Russia invades Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the president has approved a Pentagon plan to use US troops in Poland to help evacuate American citizens who would likely be forced out of Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion. There are as many as 30,000 Americans who have been living and working in Ukraine.

Elements of the US Army’s 82nd Airborne Corp being deployed to Poland will set up tent camps near the border with Ukraine to temporarily house Americans. The troops are not being deployed to Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, and would not conduct missions there, the Journal reported, citing unnamed US officials.

The Pentagon has not publicly disclosed any plans to use US troops for evacuations.

Harris’s effectiveness on a range of issues at home has been criticised, especially by opposition Republicans. But on the global stage, she has been greeted as a trailblazer – a rare female leader from the US, according to Reuters.

Biden has regularly urged his vice president to engage with foreign leaders directly and develop her own rapport with key US partners, White House officials have said.

“The vice president is starting to, more clearly and publicly, demonstrate how she is a key player in executing our foreign policy across the board,” a White House official told Reuters.

The vice president has sought to establish foreign policy credentials in phone calls with foreign leaders and in travel to Central America, Asia and Europe to advance administration priorities, includingreducing migrationfrom Central America into the US and bolstering international support tocounter China’s growing global influence.

The Munich trip will be Harris’s highest-profile foreign trip yet. The meeting was held virtually in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This year’s conference will take place unperson on February 18-20 in Munich.

Biden has frequented the conference in past as a senator and vice president. Last year, he addressed the conference virtually anddeclared an end to the era of “America-first”diplomacy under his predecessor Donald Trump.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/9/vp-kamala-harris-to-rally-us-allies-at-munich-security-conference,POSITIVE,0.9975242018699646
Kamala Harris,US VP Harris calls for ‘immediate’ Gaza truce in rare rebuke of Israel,"United States Vice President Kamala Harris has called for an “immediate” pause in fighting in Gaza while issuing a rare rebuke of Israel.

“Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table,” Harris said on Sunday.

“This will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of aid in.”

In some of the strongest criticism of Israel yet by the administration of US President Joe Biden, Harris said Israel must do more to allow the delivery of aid, including opening new border crossings and committing not to impose “unnecessary restrictions”.

“People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane and our common humanity compels us to act,” Harris said during a speech to mark the violent suppression of civil rights protesters by police in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965.

“The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses.”

What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating, and our common humanity compels us to act.

Harris also addressed Thursday’s incident during which more than 100 Palestinians were killed as they tried to access food aid in Gaza City, saying that “too many innocent Palestinians have been killed”.

“Our hearts break for the victims of that horrific tragedy,” she said.

Harris also challenged Hamas to accept the terms of a ceasefire deal that US officials say has been broadly accepted by Israel.

“Hamas needs to agree to that deal,” she said. “Let’s get a ceasefire. Let’s reunite the hostages with their families. And let’s provide immediate relief to the people of Gaza.”

Harris’s comments come as Biden is facing mounting pressure from left-leaning voters over his support for Israel ahead of November’s presidential election.

Democrats are increasingly concerned that Biden’s stance on the war could cost him votes, especially in Michigan, one of a handful of battleground states likely to decide the outcome of the election.

During the Democratic primary in Michigan last week,more than 100,000 voters cast a vote for “uncommitted”in a rebuke of the president’s position on Gaza.

Biden won Michigan, which has one of the largest Muslim populations in the country, by only about 150,000 votes in 2020.

Former President Donald Trump carried Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016, becoming the first Republican to win the Midwestern state since 1988.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/4/us-vp-harris-calls-for-immediate-gaza-ceasefire-in-rare-rebuke-of-israel,POSITIVE,0.8702035546302795
Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris lauds Biden’s ‘audacity to choose a Black woman’,"United States Senator Kamala Harris became thefirstBlack woman and first woman of South Asian descent to run for vice president after the US presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, picked her as his running mate on Tuesday.

The pair will take onPresident Donald Trumpin US presidential elections on November 3.









The choice of Harris has been hailed by many as historic.

In her first sit-down interview since being named to the ticket, Harris herself called Biden’s choice “audacious” and said it could spur advances for women and women of colour that could otherwise have taken decades.

Harris spoke to the non-profit, women-driven news organisation The 19th in an exchange that was broadcast on US TV channel MSNBC.

The 55-year-old senator from California, a former prosecutor and state attorney general, spoke on a wide range of issues from the priorities of the campaign to the importance of voting.

Below are excerpts from her Friday interview.

“Joe Biden had the audacity to choose a Black woman to be his running mate. How incredible is that? And what a statement about Joe Biden – that he decided that he was going to do that thing that was about breaking one of the most substantial barriers that has existed in our country – and that he made that decision with whatever risk that brings. I think, as much as anything, it’s a statement about the character of the man that we’re going to elect this next president of the United States.

“The Biden-Harris ticket is about an agenda that is about representing what America really is and knowing that among us, there may be those who seemingly have nothing in common but have everything in common. Joe Biden knows that. And it is also about saying that this is going to be an administration –  the Biden-Harris administration – that is focused on the future of our country, motivated by what can be unburdened by what has been.”

“I think the Biden-Harris agenda is a shared agenda. For example, Joe had a whole plan, thebuild back betterplan, about the economy, but it includes understanding the connection between the creation of jobs and also bringing dignity and support to working families.

“One of the parts of the build back better plan is to bring in healthcare and home healthcare to people who need it – [and] also to make sure that caregivers are being paid a livable and a righteous wage and getting all the benefits in terms of workers’ benefits. So in that plan he adopted the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, which is something I’ve been working on for a couple of years.

“And when we talk about domestic workers, we’re talking about predominantly women of colour who are spending hours upon hours night and day, taking care of other people’s children, other people’s parents and grandparents. The plan is about saying they too deserve dignity and support for the work that they do.”

“We have a shared commitment around addressing the climate crisis. And so there’s a whole plan that is about creating a million jobs in terms of investing in infrastructure for renewable energy, but also with a focus on making sure communities of colour and our Indigenous brothers and sisters are part of the plan – knowing that in America today in communities that have some of the worst air quality, 70 percent of the people living there are people of colour. So these are the components of the plan, the overall plan for building.

“It really is a shared commitment that is about paying attention to racial disparities, paying attention to gender disparities and also paying attention to what we need to do to grow back our country in a way that we can actually, again, aspire to the ideals that we have yet to meet but can move closer toward.”

“We still have to achieve equity when you look at issues like pay equity, something that Joe Biden talks about and we’re going to deal with in our administration.”

“There’s a lot … to celebrate in terms of the accomplishment, but also it should motivate us to also be clear-eyed about what has to be done and the unfinished business.”

“When I think about this centennial [100 years since women gained the right to vote in the US], I do also think about the fact that let’s be reminded about the ability of women also at every stage to build coalition and to fight together.  But let’s also acknowledge the disparities that still exist based on race and let’s all work on that together as those suffragettes did so many, well 100 years ago.”

“Everything. I said this back on that cold day in January in 2017, at the women’s march, which is: ‘every issue is a woman’s issue, and women’s issues should be everyone’s issues.’

“It is inexcusable that we would not have full representation in the United States Congress. I want to say that we should encourage and always support women who are running for office and support them, knowing that even if they are the first, that they are the one that is necessary for us to continue to break these barriers. I have not achieved anything that I have without the support of many who believed in the possibility of someone who has never been there before being there. And that’s what we have to do across the nation.”

“I’m the only Black woman in the United States Senate. The only one and only the second in the history of the United States Senate. And so when we look again at how far we have to go, we have a lot of work to do. And by Joe asking me to be his running mate, he has pushed forward something that might have otherwise taken decades.

“What we need to do is also speak about systemic racism. When you have one ticket that can say the phrase ‘Black Lives Matter’ and another who has been full time sowing hate and division in our country, those are the things that are going to motivate Black women to vote.”

“When we talk about the election in November, this is probably one of the most important elections of our lifetime. This is about everything, every issue that we discussed and whether we are going to have a president of the United States who lifts folks up and gives you a sense of pride in your country, or somebody who is just full time beating people down. I fear that if we don’t correct course, the damage will be irreversible.

“Everything is on the line.

“There are states and there are state legislatures who – especially after the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act – have put in place laws that have been designed to suppress the vote and in particular, the Black vote; [to prevent] students from voting, Indigenous people from voting. And those obstacles, some of them we’re going to fight against and get rid of before the election; some of them are still going to be in place.

“Everybody has to remember this and ask this question of yourself: ‘Why don’t they want us to vote? Why are they creating obstacles to us voting?’

“Well, the answer is because when we vote, things change. When we vote, things get better. When we vote, we address the disparities we’ve been talking up about. We address the need of all people to be treated with dignity and respect. These [are the] sort of things that are on the line in this election.

“So we know how to jump over or get around the obstacles that for many of us have been in place since the day we were born. And that’s going to be the job ahead of us.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/15/kamala-harris-lauds-bidens-audacity-to-choose-a-black-woman,POSITIVE,0.9930518865585327
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States PresidentJoe Biden’s withdrawalfrom the 2024 presidential race has left Democrats grappling with unanswered questions about the way forward, with less than four months before election day.

Biden stepped aside on Sunday after weeks of pressure from fellow Democrats following adisastrous debateperformance against former President Donald Trump in June.

Now, Democrats need to coalesce around a new nominee and re-energise their base if they want todefeat Trump, analysts say. Vice President Kamala Harris is an early favourite to replace Biden, especially after she received the president’s endorsement. Biden also encouraged donors to contribute to Harris for her campaign.

Still, Biden’sdecision to withdrawis not merely unusual — it is unprecedented in modern US politics. “We’re in uncharted territory here,” said Kyle Kondik, the managing editor for the Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a newsletter about elections published by the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

And Harris could face challengers seeking the Democratic nomination in the coming days.

The new nominee will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, when more than 4,000 party officials and activists, known as delegates, gather to vote.

There have been instances where parties have chosen their candidates in competitive conventions after the primaries. In fact, that happened frequently before the modern primary system was put in place in 1972, granting voters a greater say in the process.

But the Democrats’ current situation is different.

Having won nearly allpledged delegates, Biden is now the first presumptive nominee of a major party to quit the race after the primaries have concluded.

The president ran in the primaries without any serious challengers and Democratic officials stressed early on that Biden – as the incumbent – will be the likely nominee.

“I don’t really think there’s any good recent precedent for it. Half a century or more ago, it wasn’t uncommon to go into the convention not necessarily knowing for sure who the nominee was going to be,” Kondik, who spoke to Al Jazeera earlier this week, said.

“But since then, we haven’t had this sort of situation where somebody dominates the primary season – but then steps aside later, in advance of the convention.”

With no historical precedent to follow, Democrats will have to improvise within their guidelines on how to choose their new nominee, analysts say.

While the change comes with risks, a new candidate could galvanise Democratic voters who had previously resigned themselves to the uphill battle of taking on Trump at a time when his lead over Biden had widened across battleground states.

Before dropping out, Biden was set to face Republican nominee Trump for the second presidential election in a row.

Meena Bose, a professor of political science at Hofstra University, said that while it is risky to change candidates so close to the elections, a shake-up at the top of the Democratic ticket could boost the party’s chances.

“A late change is not ideal but may bring more optimism than no change at all or, at the very least, might potentially be helpful down the ballot, if not in the presidential race,” Bose said.

Soon after Biden announced his departure from the race, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him at the top of the Democratic Party ticket.

Kondik said Biden’s endorsement makes a big difference. The president has the support of the overwhelming majority of delegates. And while they are not bound to back Harris, Biden’s backing could tip the scales in her favour. In the hours that followed Biden’s announcement, a flood of leading Democrats publicly endorsed Harris – from Senator Elizabeth Warren and state leaders of the Democratic Party to governors who were seen as potential rivals for the nomination, such as California’s Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro.

Thevice presidentalso has national name recognition and can inherit the Biden-Harris campaign infrastructure.

Kondik said that nominating Harris was the “path of least resistance” for Democrats. Bose echoed that assessment, saying that Harris was the most “logical choice” to ensure a “seamless transition”.

“There is not a lot of time for an open competition for delegate support,” she told Al Jazeera.

Hans Noel, a professor at Georgetown University’s Department of Government, also said on Friday – before Biden’s announcement – that Harris was projected to take over the nomination.

“The vice presidential candidate does not automatically become the presidential candidate, but I think a lot of voters would sort of expect that,” Noel told Al Jazeera in an email.

“Given that she’s in that position, there are a lot of reasons not to go to someone else. She does have a lot of support in the party, but more importantly, nominating someone else would look like skipping over a Black woman, which would not look good for many in the party.”

The rules for the Democratic National Committee state that delegates can propose a new party nominee if they obtain the signatures of 300 fellow delegates, along with a signature of confirmation from the proposed candidate. But the party will, in all likelihood, coalesce around Harris to present a united front.

The Democratic Party now faces the anxiety-inducing question of how voters will respond to Biden’s departure from the presidential race, a considerable shake-up so close to the election.

US presidential campaigns require massive investments of cash and manpower to reach people across the country. Some start as early as two years in advance. Launching a campaign from scratch will not be easy.

“Campaigns take huge amounts of infrastructure, money [and] messaging to get through to the voters that we know are most undecided,” said Casey Burgat, the director of the legislative affairs programme at George Washington University.

Burgat explained that reaching undecided voters is also labour-intensive: “You need to hit them several times. You need to have people knocking on doors. There’s just a huge infrastructure to be built.”

What happens to the campaign funds Biden amassed is also a source of uncertainty. With no precedent for the current situation, questions have swirled over the fate of Biden’s war chest.

In the US, after all, election spending can run into millions, if not billions, of dollars.

But Burgat noted that campaign finance restrictions are less of an issue for Harris since she is already on the ticket as Biden’s vice president and has been part of his fundraising efforts.

However, if Biden’s exit has drawbacks, it also presents opportunities. Many voters had been unenthused about the prospect of an election between Biden and Trump.

Before Biden’s announcement, a recent poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 65 percent of Democrats believed he should exit the race.

Just three in 10 expressed confidence that he had the mental acuity necessary to serve effectively as president.

Burgat says that a new, younger candidate could have an energising effect and give the party a much-needed boost.

“The most common thing we’ve heard is: ‘I can’t believe these are our two options.’ People have been wondering how, in this country of 350 million people, their choice has been reduced to these two very unpopular candidates,” he said.

Democrats in competitive congressional districts had grown especially worried that Biden’s unpopularitycould stymiecandidates up and down the ballot, lowering their chances in races that might otherwise be winnable.

Recent polling pointed to an alarming trend in that direction. The Wall Street Journalreportedthat a poll by Blue Rose Research suggested that more than half of swing voters believed Democrats had been lying about Biden’s mental fitness.

Nearly 30 percent of voters who supported Biden in 2020 felt the same way, too, according to the poll.

Democrats may fear that playing down Biden’s age could tarnish their credibility with voters and do long-term damage to the party. According to Burgat, that contributed to the pressure that informed Biden’s decision.

“Democrats will be able to say, and rightfully so, that things change when there are widespread concerns about a candidate,” said Burgat. “They can make the case that this job – this election – is too important to ignore those concerns.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/21/joe-biden-has-dropped-out-of-the-presidential-race-what-happens-next,NEGATIVE,0.9851389527320862
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States Vice President Kamala Harris has tried to stemwaning supportfrom Black men in an increasinglytight presidential raceby unveiling a series of economic proposals aimed at empowering and driving them tothe polls.

Harris, the Democratic candidate in next month’s election, introduced an “opportunity agenda for Black men” on Monday that is meant to give the demographic more chances to thrive as she works to energise a key voting bloc.

The proposals include $1m in forgivable small business loans and a promise to legalise recreational marijuana and ensure Black entrepreneurs have access to the new industry.

The announcement comes as the Harris campaign has grown increasingly concerned withslipping supportfrom Black men just weeks before she takes on Republican Donald Trump in the election on November 5.

According to recent polls, 70 percent of Black male voters said they would support Harris — down from 85 percent who supported US President Joe Biden in the last election four years ago.

Younger Black men, in particular, have been steadily turning away from the Democratic Party, frustrated that their experiences are not reflected in policy as much as those of other groups.

It’s not clear how many of those voters would turn to Harris’s rival, Trump, or simply sit out the election. The former president has been courting Black voters by saying they stand to lose jobs to migrants crossing the border – and promisinga crackdown on immigration.







More than a quarter of young Black men say they would support Trump in the election, according to a recent poll by the NAACP, one of the country’s largest Black civil rights organisations.

In a statement, the Harris campaign said “Black men have long felt that too often their voice in our political process has gone unheard and that there is so much untapped ambition and leadership within the Black male community”.

Other proposals introduced by the campaign include boosting access to the cryptocurrency industry for Black Americans and launching a national health equity initiative focused on Black men that addresses diseases like sickle cell anemia, which disproportionately affects the community.

Cedric Richmond, co-chair of the Harris campaign and a former Louisiana congressman who is Black, said Harris wants to build an economy “where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth”.

If elected, Harris would be the second Black president and first woman in the office, even as she has sought todownplay her identityon the campaign trail.

The vice president’s support from Black women remains strong, at about 83 percent.

But last week,former President Barack Obama, one of the Democratic Party’s most popular figures, issued an urgent call for Black men to drop “excuses” and vote for Harris, suggesting that the lacklustre support among some may have to do with sexism.

Some Black men, Obama said, “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president”.

“I’m sorry, gentlemen. I’ve noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump’s behaviour – the bullying, and the putting people down – is a sign of strength. I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is,” he said at a rally in Pennsylvania.

“Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can’t always stand up for themselves”.

But some Black people took offence at Obama’s remarks. “It’s wrong to single out Black men when Black men are the most loyal male voting block for Democrats,” Nina Turner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, said on social media.







Harris has told campaign staff that they need to do more outreach to Black men, including rallies and events that put them centre stage.

But while the new plans are intended to cater to Black people, she is seeking to emphasise how her economic proposals benefit all men.

The campaign has also been working to increase support among other male voting blocs, including Hispanics, by founding the group “Hombres con Harris” – “Men for Harris”, in Spanish.

As her campaign has done with the group, Harris’s team plans to organise gender-specific gatherings.

That includes “Black Men Huddle Up” events in battleground states featuring African-American male celebrities for watch parties for NFL and NCAA football games. The campaign says it also plans new testimonial ads in battleground states that feature local Black male voices.

On Monday, it began airing a new ad in Philadelphia that seemed aimed at addressing the sexism referenced by Obama.

“She’s had our back since day one,” said the ad’s narrator. “Let’s be honest and get a reality check. Women know how to make things happen.”

The debate over to what degree misogyny plays a role in some Black men not supporting Harris sidesteps a broader conversation on how Black men are engaged as full citizens in politics, argued Philip Agnew, founder of the grassroots political organisation Black Men Build.

“To be a Black man in the United States is to be invisible and hypervisible at the same time, and neither one of those is a humanising viewpoint,” Agnew said, adding that Black men he has spoken with have expressed exasperation towards politics, a sentiment shared by many Americans.

“The Black men I know are incredibly concerned with the lives of our families and our communities.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/14/kamala-harris-promises-opportunity-for-black-men-amid-waning-support,POSITIVE,0.6231545209884644
Kamala Harris,VP Harris urges defence of sovereignty in South China Sea,"The United States will stand by the Philippines in the face of intimidation and coercion in the South China Sea, US Vice President Kamala Harris has said while visiting Palawan island on the edge of the disputed waters.

On board a Philippine coastguard vessel docked in Puerto Princesa Bay, Harris said on Tuesday that the United States and the broader international community “have aprofound stakein the future of this region”.

Harris’s Palawan stop was part of a three-day visit to one of the US’s oldest security allies in Asia, which is also central to its bid to counter China’s increasingly assertive policies in the South China Sea, and towards Taiwan.

“We must stand up for principles such as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, unimpeded lawful commerce, the peaceful resolution of disputes, and the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, and throughout the Indo-Pacific,” Harris said in a speech

Washington will press for an international campaign against “irresponsible behaviour in the disputed waters, she said.

Harris did not cite China by name but was referring to Beijing when she underscored the US’s support for treaty ally the Philippines.

Beijing has claimed almost all of the South China Sea, which is also claimed in parts by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.

In a victory for Manila, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled Beijing’s expansive South China Sea claims had no legal basis, but Beijing has ignored the decision.

The Philippines has since filed hundreds of protests over what it calls encroachment and harassment by China’s coastguard and its vast fishing fleet.

During her speech, Harris reiterated Washington’s support for the 2016 arbitration ruling, which China said it would not accept, saying the decision “is legally binding and must be respected”.

Harris’s highly symbolic trip to Palawan was the last leg of a visit that kicked off in Manila on Monday with talks with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

A new confrontation erupted in the run-up to her visit when the Philippine navy alleged a Chinese coastguard vessel had forcibly seized Chinese rocket debris as Filipino sailors were towing it to a Philippine-controlled island.

Marcos Jr told reporters that he was inclined to send a diplomatic protest to China over the incident because China had denied that it forcibly seized the debris.

Marcos had said during one-to-one talks with Harris on Monday that the two nations’ strong ties had become even more important, given what he called “upheavals” in the region.

In the same talks, Harris reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to defend the Philippines under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty which obligated the allies to help defend each other, should one side come under attack.

“An armed attack on the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke US Mutual Defense commitments,” Harris told Marcos Jr. “And that is anunwavering commitmentthat we have to the Philippines.”

Before boarding the coastguard ship, Harris visited Tagburos, one of Palawan’s many coastal communities where she spoke with local leaders and fishermen, whose livelihoods are threatened by illegal and unreported fishing and climate change.

“Communities like this have seen the consequences, and people here know the impact when foreign vessels enter Philippine waters and illegally deplete the fishing stock, and when they harass and intimidate local fishers,” Harris said in an apparent swipe at China.

The visit came amidstrained relationsbetweenChina and the US, particularly overTaiwan, the democratically governed island China claims as its own.

“China consistently believes that communication and cooperation between countries should be conducive to increasing understanding and trust between countries in the region,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a regular briefing.

“We are not opposed to the United States and the Philippines having normal contact, but this kind of contact should not harm other countries’ interests,” he said.

Palawan is about 320 km (200 miles) from the Spratly Islands, where China has dredged the sea floor to build harbours and airstrips.

In March, US Indo-Pacific commander Admiral John C Aquilino told The Associated Press that China had fully militarised at least three of several islands it built in the disputed waters and armed them with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment in an increasingly aggressive move that threatened all nations operating nearby.

The long-running maritime dispute is regarded as an Asian flashpoint and a delicate fault line in the US-China rivalry in the region.

The US will provide an additional $7.5m in aid to Philippine maritime law enforcement agencies to boost their capacity to counter illegal fishing, carry out sea surveillance and help in search and rescue efforts, including in the South China Sea, according to a statement issued by the US vice president’s office.

The Philippine coastguard will also receive additional US help to upgrade a vessel traffic management system for better safety at sea. The Philippines is also now receiving real-time surveillance data to be able to detect and counter illicit activities at sea in a project by the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, an informal strategic bloc that involves the US, India, Japan and Australia, according to Harris’s office.

Chinese coastguard ships have blocked Philippine supply boats delivering supplies to Filipino forces in the disputed waters in the past but seizing objects in the possession of another nation’s military would constitute a more brazen act.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States presidential candidateDonald Trumphas filed a lawsuit against a UStelevision networkfor what he calls a “misleading” interview with rivalKamala Harris.

The suit against CBS News filed in a Texas court on Thursday alleged the network aired two different responses from Democratic presidential candidateKamala Harriswhen responding to a question about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

The version that aired during the60 Minutesprogramme on October 6 did not include what the lawsuit called a “word salad” response from Harris about the Biden administration’s influence on Israel’s conduct of the war.

The suit filed by the Republican Party presidential nominee essentially accused CBS of editing Harris’s response to make it seem clearer.

The lawsuit has been filed in federal court in the Texas city of Amarillo, which has only one judge – Matthew Kacsmaryk. US media reports said the Trump-appointed judge’s court had become an increasingly popular choice for lawsuits filed by Republicans.

CBS News has rejected the claims.

“Former President Trump’s repeated claims against 60 Minutes are false,” a CBS News spokesperson said. “The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it.”

The suit demanded a jury trial and about $10bn in damages, the filing showed. It alleged violations of a Texas law barring deceptive acts in the conduct of business.

Trump has repeatedly assailed the network on the campaign trail over the episode and has threatened to revoke CBS’s broadcasting licence if elected. CBS has said Trump backed out of his own planned interview with 60 Minutes.







The lawsuit is just another example of Trump’s fraught relationship with the media. He has called it “fake news” and the “enemy of the people” and has often called for television stations to have their licences revoked.

However, Trump is also still willing to talk to media outlets such as Fox News that he considers friendly, and continues to give regular and often relaxed off-the-cuff news conferences during the campaign.

The organisation Reporters Without Borders, known by its French acronym RSF, which monitors press freedom worldwide, is worried that Trump poses “an existential threat” to the media’s ability to do its job in the US.

ItanalysedTrump’s campaign comments from September 1 to October 24, 2024. It found he had “insulted, attacked, or threatened the media at least 108 times in public speeches or remarks”.

RSF’s executive director, Clayton Weimers, warned that violent words could lead to physical violence against reporters.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Tim Walz has formally accepted his nomination to be the Democrats vice presidential candidate in November’s US election, rallying the the party faithful in Chicago with a message of freedom and hope.

“It’s the honour of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States,” Walz said on Wednesday, as he took to the stage at the end of the third day of theDemocratic National Convention. “What all we’re all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason. We love this country.”

Walz, the 60-year-old governor of Minnesota, was a relative unknown until Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate just over two weeks ago.

Walztalked of his upbringing in a town of just 400 people in Nebraska, his service with the National Guard and his experience as a teacher.

He stressed the importance of preserving personal freedoms, taking a swipe at Republicans who have rolled back abortion rights, adding that in his experience most Americans considered such issues to be private matters.

“We respect our neighbours and the personal choices that they make,” he said of his Midwestern community. “And even if we would not make those choices for ourselves, we have one rule: ‘Mind your own damn business.'”

The crowd, many holding “Coach Walz” banners in reference to his years coaching football, cheered and waved.

Freedom was the theme of the third day of the convention with Democratic luminaries such as former President Bill Clinton taking the stage, as well as celebrities from singers Stevie Wonder to John Legend to comedian Mindy Kaling and media personality Oprah Winfrey.

While the message was overwhelmingly one of optimism as the speakers endorsed Harris and Walz, there were also plenty of swipes at Trump who was portrayed as vain and self-obsessed.

“Next time you hear him, don’t count the lies. Count the I’s,” the now 78-year-old Clinton told the crowd.

There were deafening cheers as Winfrey, who later described herself as an independent, walked onto the stage.

She rallied the crowd with a powerful endorsement of democracy and the need to get out the vote.

“I’m calling on all you independents and all you undecideds,” Winfrey said. “Values and character matter in leadership and in life. Decency and respect are on the ballot in 2024.”

Harris emerged as the Democrats’ candidate last month after President Joe Biden stepped aside.

The convention has also featured a number of Republicans who have turned against Trump, who was president from 2017 to 2021.

On Wednesday, the Democrats put the spotlight onJanuary 6, 2021, with a video that showed Trump calling on supporters to be strong and fight before they stormed the US Capitol to try and block Biden’s 2020 victory.

The delegates sat in stunned silence, a sharp contrast to their roars and applause throughout the night.

Olivia Troye, who quit her White House national security job under Trump after the Capitol assault, said the Republican candidate was laying the groundwork to undermine the 2024 election.

Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia, spoke directly to the camera to tell fellow Republicans watching from home that they needed to “dump Trump”.

“If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, you’re not a Democrat. You’re a patriot,” he said.

Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who was House speaker at the time of the Capitol assault, said: “Let us not forget who assaulted democracy on January 6: He did. But let us not forget who saved democracy that day: We did.”

Kamala Harris,‘A unique relationship:’ How Kamala Harris courts the progressive left,"Washington, DC –Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to theDemocratic National Conventionnext week on the tailwinds of endorsements from major progressive organisations — a nod to the party unity she has inspired.

But that marks a shift for Harris, who has not always enjoyed a cosy relationship with the progressive wing of her party.

Still, many progressives see Harris’s candidacy in the 2024 presidential race as an opportunity to chart a more leftward course for the White House.

“Vice President Kamala Harris has a unique relationship with the progressive movement,” said William Walter, the executive director of Our Wisconsin Revolution, a battleground state organisation that pledges to “stand for progressive principles”.

Walter told Al Jazeera that Harris is no progressive dreamboat: She has struggled to convey the same authenticity and clarity of message as progressive icons like Bernie Sanders.

“But a lot of progressives recognise that democracy is quite literally on the ballot this November,” he said, referencing the threat he perceives in Harris’s Republican rival, former President Donald Trump.

The first step, Walter explained, is to stop Trump from retaking the White House.

“Once we prevent that, I think that’s when the real work begins. That’s when we need to start pressuring the Democratic Party to expand into the working-class-centred party that we have been in the past.”







Harris’s meteoric rise as the Democratic nominee has been unorthodox, to say the least.

In late July, her boss, President Joe Biden, abruptly withdrew from the presidential race and threw his support behind Harris instead.

Biden — seen as a centrist — had been courting middle-ground voters in the months before his exit. But when Harris took over the Democratic ticket, her campaign went in a different direction, embracing a distinctly populist angle.

On Friday, for instance, she unveiled a sweeping economic plan aimed at “lowering costs for American families”, including through the elimination of medical debt for many Americans and bans on “price gouging” for groceries.

The policy proposals also featured subsidies for first-time homebuyers and a $6,000 tax credit for families of newborns, covering the first year of a child’s life.

Harris also adopted Trump’s proposal to eliminate the federal tax on tips, an idea popular with service industry workers. Her campaign has played up her history working at the fast-food chain McDonald’s, as a symbol of her middle-class roots.

In her first campaign speech, Harris flashed a populist streak. “Because we are a people-powered campaign,” she said, “that is how you know we will be a people-first presidency.”

She has pledged to champion progressive priorities, including affordable housing, increased access to childcare and paid family leave.

But even as she has been embraced by progressive leaders, Harris has moved to the centre on other issues.

For example, when she first ran for the presidency in 2019, she supported Sanders’s Medicare for All legislation, which would have established a “single-payer system” and done away with private insurers.

This year, however, her campaign has said she will not support a single-payer system and will focus instead on other mechanisms for lowering healthcare costs.

And despite plans to address climate change — another progressive priority — Harris has baulked at supporting a ban on fracking, a controversial method of extracting oil and natural gas.







Another point of contention between Harris and the progressive movement is her background in criminal justice.

On the campaign trail, Harris has leaned into her past as the district attorney of San Francisco and the attorney general of California, the state’s top law enforcement official.

She has argued that her background as a prosecutor makes her the ideal candidate to defeat Trump, who has 34 felony convictions.

“In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds,” she told a crowd this month in Detroit, Michigan. “So hear me, Detroit, when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.”

But Harris’s history as a prosecutor has previously been seen as a liability among progressives, who are largely in favour of criminal justice reform.

During her 2019 presidential campaign, for instance, memes circulated online declaring, “Kamala is a cop.” Progressives expressed concern about hard-knuckle policies Harris had embraced as a prosecutor, including one that would have levied criminal charges against parents of repeatedly absent schoolchildren.

Criticsarguedsuch policies would help to fuel mass incarceration, which disproportionately affects people of colour.

Harris’s defenders, however, have argued her tenure as a prosecutor was much more complicated than what critics portray. At one point, she evenproposeddiverting police funding to other government agencies.

Ameshia Cross, a Democratic strategist, told Al Jazeera she believes the criticisms against Harris at the time were a result of the cultural moment.

The US was in the middle of a reckoning over police violence against Black people in 2019 and 2020, and social movements like Black Lives Matter were on the rise.

“During Kamala Harris’s first run for the White House, when she was in the primary, one of the main hits that she took — as well as anybody who had a prosecutorial background — was related to Black Lives Matter, policing issues and accountability when it came to progress and police reforms,” Cross explained.

“I do think that it really took a lot of the wind out of her sails, particularly when it came to young voters.”

But for some racial justice activists, the concern about Harris’s commitment to police reform has endured.

“Police accountability, police reform, stopping them from murdering Black and brown kids is still a pressing issue,” Chivona Newsome, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York, told Al Jazeera.

Newsome argued that Harris has not shown she is serious about police reform. She pointed to the police killing of Sonya Massey, an unarmed Black woman shot in her home on July 6, as grim reminder of the continued urgency of such reforms.

“In 2020, Biden and Harris rolled the tide because everyone was screaming ‘Black Lives Matter’,” she said. “But when they won the office, nothing has been done.”

Because Harris entered the 2024 presidential race so late, she did not have to compete in state-level primaries — a process Newsome feels could have forced the vice president to take a stronger stand on criminal justice reform.

The National Black Lives Matter organisation has so far declined to endorse Harris, citing the lack of a regular primary season.







The 2024 race presents other new challenges for Harris’s campaign as it courts left-wing voters.

Progressives have clashed with Biden over his support for Israel’s war in Gaza — and some question whether Harris will break from her boss’s pro-Israel policies. One of her campaign advisers has already doused the hope she would embrace an arms embargo against Israel.

Domestically, some segments of the progressive left worry that donors like Barry Diller, the founder of Fox Broadcasting Company, and Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, could push Harris to abandon antitrust campaigns against business monopolies.

Diller and Hoffman have been publicly pushing for Harris to replace Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan — a champion of monopoly busting — if she enters the White House.

That is one area that progressive supporters will be closely watching in the coming weeks, according to Alan Minsky, the executive director of Progressive Democrats of America.

The group, which has chapters in 31 states, has thrown its weight behind Harris. It is the first time the organisation has ever endorsed a candidate in the general election. A resounding 92 percent of its members voted to endorse Harris in a formal poll.

“I think the way our activists have looked at it, the baseline was not what we saw in 2019. The baseline was where we saw the Biden campaign,” Minsky said.

“When Biden stepped down and Harris stepped up, we felt a huge groundswell of support from our base for Harris — and that included many of our activists.”







Minsky explained that Harris’s history indicates she could better represent progressive policies than Biden has.

For instance, he drew a comparison between Biden and Harris on single-payer healthcare: Biden never supported it. Harris did.

It is “better to have somebody who once supported it and clearly has thought it through, even if she eventually turned away from it”, Minsky said.

He also sees Harris as part of a larger turn by the Democratic Party towards a more progressive economic agenda — moving away from a more neoliberal platform that favoured privatisation and deregulation.

Still, Minsky said that, if Harris wins the presidency, he expects only “incremental, progressive changes that can set us towards what does really need to happen”.

“We do not mean to be just a simple cheerleader,” he said of his organisation. “We anticipate that Kamala Harris as president will not enter office poised to fulfil our agenda, which we are adamant is the agenda the American people want and the best agenda for the society.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/16/a-unique-relationship-how-kamala-harris-courts-the-progressive-left,POSITIVE,0.9883099794387817
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Washington, DC –Despite touting her unwavering support for Israel as the country wages war in Gaza and Lebanon, Democratic presidential candidateKamala Harrisis trying to garner support in Arab and Muslim communities in the United States before elections next month.

In recent weeks, the US vice president and her team have held meetings with Arab and Muslim “community leaders” while receiving endorsements from Muslim individuals and groups aligned with her Democratic Party.

But many advocates argue that as long as Harris maintains her pledge to continue to arm Israel and refuses to distance herself from President Joe Biden’sunconditional supportfor the US ally, nothing will help her standing with Arab and Muslim voters.

Moreover, critics have slammed the private meetings by Harris and her top national security adviser with handpicked attendees – whose identities are often not made public – as not representative of the communities her campaign says it is hoping to win over.

“Such groups and faceless individuals are mere tokens for the Democratic Party, paraded by Harris’s campaign to check off a box recommended by an algorithm — a strategy she maintained campaigning ontrends and memesrather than impactful policy,” Laura Albast, a Palestinian American activist in the Washington, DC, area, told Al Jazeera.

She said the perception that voters would approve US-backed atrocities in Gaza and Lebanon because the person shaking Harris’s hand looked like them was “insanity”.







Harris’s push to reach out to Arab and Muslim voters comes as Israel’s military assaults on Gaza and Lebanon are escalating, heighteninganger and anxietyin these communities just weeks before the November 5 elections.

For months, community members have urged the vice president to break from Biden and put conditions on US military aid to Israel to pressure the country to end its onslaught on the Gaza Strip.

But Harris has rebuffed those calls. In August, hercampaign rejectedpleas to allow a Palestinian American speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

And this week,she joined Bidenon a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which the US administration expressed “ironclad” support for Israel.

Harris met with Arab and Muslim advocates in Flint, north of Detroit, Michigan – a key battleground state with sizeable Arab communities – on Sunday. Days earlier, her top national security adviser held a similar meeting virtually.

Hussein Dabajeh, a Lebanese American political consultant in the Detroit area, decried the lack of transparency around such meetings.

He said the Harris campaign is “afraid” to have an open dialogue with representatives of the community, so it is reverting to behind-closed-doors discussions to appear like it is listening to Arab and Muslim Americans.

He stressed that the main audience for these meetings is not Arabs and Muslims but the broader electorate as the Democratic Party is trying to portray its candidate as inclusive and caring.

“It’s a meeting just to check off the headline. There’s no actual substance behind it,” Dabajeh told Al Jazeera.

“It’s unfortunate that the people meeting with them believe after one year of our people getting massacred that these fake meetings are still going to do it.”







The Biden administration and campaign – before he dropped out of the presidential race – also heldsimilar meetingsthat failed to improve his standing among Arab and Muslim Americans or quell the outrage over his support for the war on Gaza.

The US provides Israel at least $3.8bn in military aid annually, and the Biden administration has authorised $14bn in further assistance to its ally to help fund the ongoing war.

One group that did attend the Flint meeting is Emgage, a Muslim American political advocacy group.

“Emgage Action called on Vice President Harris to do everything in her power, should she win, to end the war and reset US policy in the region,” the group said in a statement.

“Emgage Action also reiterated the organization and the Muslim community’s disappointment in the handling of the crisis that has endangered the well being of our communities at home and is now widening to a broader regional war.”

Deputy Wayne County Executive Assad Turfe, who lost family members during Israel’s 2006 war in Lebanon, also attended the meeting.

“I met with Vice President Harris and shared this deeply personal loss. I emphasized that we need her leadership now to help bring an end to the violence,” he wrote in a social media post. “I hope that her administration will take this call seriously and act swiftly to bring the much-needed relief and action that we all hope for.”

He said he brought up the issues of displaced people in Lebanon, the need for evacuatingUS citizens trappedin the country and immediate humanitarian aid.

“In these critical times, we may not all agree on strategy, but we must still work together and advocate to end this war and provide relief to the people of Lebanon and Gaza NOW! We must push for action that not only saves lives but restores hope and dignity to those who are suffering,” Turfe said.







Emgage raised many eyebrows late last month when it announced it was endorsing Harris’s bid for the White House – days into Israel’s devastatingbombing campaignin Lebanon, which has already destroyed large parts of the country.

The group, which almost exclusively endorses Democrats and is led by figures who have worked in Democratic administrations, argued that the endorsement is rooted in preventing the Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, from winning.

“This endorsement is not an agreement with Vice President Harris on all issues, but rather, an honest guidance to our voters regarding the difficult choice they confront at the ballot box,” it said in astatement.

Emgage also praised the Biden-Harris administration for appointing Muslim Americans to federal jobs.

But as the war rages in Gaza and people flee southern Lebanon amid a relentless Israeli bombardmentsupported bythe Biden-Harris administration, some advocates see the nod of support for the vice president not only as misguided but also insulting.

Suehaila Amen, a community advocate in Michigan, had a scathing message for Emgage: “I’m disgusted by the fact that none of you have any dignity or honour, that the mass slaughter of Muslims on a global scale isn’t enough for you to hold your head up high.”

Michigan is home to a large Lebanese American population, tens of thousands of whom hail from Lebanon’s southernvillages and townsthat have been largely depopulated and decimated by the Israeli offensive

Emgage and two of its representatives did not return Al Jazeera’s repeated requests for comment on the criticism of the group’s position.







Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American activist and comedian, called the Emgage endorsement of Harris a “spit in the face of our community”.

“Emgage has announced that, as far as they are concerned, no amount of massacred Arab children is enough to abandon the Biden-Harris administration,” Zahr told Al Jazeera.

“According to Emgage, genocide is excusable in order to stay loyal to the Democratic ticket. Their statement openly and proudly states that securing federal appointments trumps repeated vetoes of ceasefire resolutions, prouddeclarations of Zionismand tens of thousands of Arab bodies under the rubble.”

Separately from the Emgage endorsement, 25 Muslim imams and community figures – mostly from Georgia and the Washington, DC, area – penned a joint statement last week backing the vice president.

In the endorsement – first reported by NBC News – they credited Harris for speaking out against “the devastating loss of life in Gaza and the unfolding humanitarian crisis” . But the authors avoided any mention of the vice president’s support for the Israeli offensive, which they described as a “genocide”.

“When the war in Gaza began, she traveled and met with regional leaders and made clear that the US would pursue a two-state solution, and what reconstruction of Gaza would look like, she also made clear that international humanitarian law must be respected,” the statement said.

Several Biden administration officials have decried the suffering in Gaza.

For example, Secretary of StateAntony Blinkensaid he sees his “own children” in the eyes of Palestinian children enduring displacement and bombardment.

Still, according to recent USmedia reports, Blinken defied assessments by various US officials when he certified that Israel was not blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza – a decision that allowed the US to continue to transfer arms to its ally.

And like Blinken, when talking about Palestinian pain, Harris uses passive voice about the atrocities in Gaza and avoids assigning responsibility to Israel.







Moreover, Harris often stresses that her support for Israel is “unwavering”. She has been part of an administration that has overseen unconditional support for the brutal war on Gaza, and recently, she welcomed Israeliescalation in Lebanon.

When asked recently what she would have done differently from Biden, Harris said “not a thing that comes to mind”, stressing that she has been part of the decision-making process at the White House on most important issues.

The Biden-Harris administration hasvetoedthree proposals at the United Nations Security Council that would have called for a ceasefire in Gaza.

This week, Harrisdescribed Iran– not Russia or China – as America’s “greatest adversary”, a position that further aligns her with the Netanyahu government.

Given Harris’s record and the equally staunch support for Israel of her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, as well as hisanti-immigrant rhetoric, many Arab and Muslim voters feel frustrated with the two-party political system in the US.

On Monday, the Abandon Harris campaign, a Michigan-based Muslim group that says it aims to hold the Democratic administration “accountable for the Gaza genocide”, endorsed Green Party candidateJill Steinfor president.

“Our movement remains dedicated to ensuring that the American people, especially the Muslim-American community, recognize the responsibility we share in standing up against oppression and using all our power to stop genocide — wherever it may arise,” the group said in a statement.

“On the precipice of the election, we endorse Jill Stein.”

Stein has virtually no chance of winning the presidency, but she has seen a surge of support in Arab and Muslim communities, according to recentpolls, in part due to her advocacy for Palestinian rights.

Trump has also seen his numbersimprovein Arab and Muslim communities, and last month, he was endorsed by the Yemeni American mayor of Hamtramck, a Muslim-majority city in southeast Michigan.

As the election nears, recent campaigning has sparked debates about the representation and priorities of Arab and Muslim communities in the US, whose members share similar cultures and religious practices but are not a monolith.

“We unequivocally condemn those from our community who continue to exploit theblood of Arab peoplefor their political agenda,” the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said in a statement on Sunday.

“This includes individuals and organizations from our community that are in lock-step with the Democratic and Republican parties, putting party over community, politics over justice, and overlooking a genocide for access.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/11/amid-anger-over-israel-harris-courts-arab-and-muslim-voters-will-it-work,NEGATIVE,0.9852324724197388
Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris appeals to Latino voters at Las Vegas town hall,"US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidateKamala Harrishas underscored her restrictive approach to immigration in a town hall with undecided Latino voters, a testament to her embrace of hawkish border policies as she comes under attack from the right on immigration.

Seeking to strike a balance between a tough approach and empathy towards immigrants, Harris chastised rival Donald Trump for telling Republican lawmakers not to back a bill supported by the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden that would roll back access to asylum and pour more resources into border militarisation.

“A bipartisan group of members of Congress, including one of the most conservative members of the United States senate, came together with one of the strongest border security bills we’ve had in decades,” Harris told a tearful audience member, in response to a question about the hardships faced by undocumented people who spend decades in the US without gaining access to citizenship or basic services.

“There are real people who are suffering because of an inability to put solutions in front of politics,” she added, calling the US immigration system “broken”.

The town hall, hosted and broadcast by the Spanish-language network Univision and held in Las Vegas, Nevada, comes as Democrats have beenlosing groundwith Latino voters, once a reliably blue voting block.

While Harris continues to lead Trump with that section of the electorate, a recent poll by NBC News and Telemundo showed Democrats’ advantage with Latino voters has declined to its lowest level in the past four presidential cycles.

The poll put support for Harris at 54 percent among registered Latino voters, while Trump got 40 percent and another 6 percent said they were undecided.

Trump, whose own Univision town hall in Florida was postponed because ofHurricane Milton, famously called Mexicans “rapists” and “drug dealers” in his first presidential campaign — one of manyinsults he directed at immigrants and Hispanics.

But some Hispanic voters have turned to the Republican Party in recent years and this election cycle, citing immigration, the economy, and the rising cost of living as top priorities they see Trump as more likely to tackle.

“If there is an erosion of support in 2024, even if the Democrats win the race, which I hope they do, I think they need to ask themselves some very hard questions about how and what they’re doing to engage Hispanic voters,” Fernand Amandi, a Hispanic pollster in Miami, told Al Jazeera.

He said Harris was handicapped by her late entry into the race.

“It’s a shame because I think what she has proven is that she is an excellent campaigner…I’m sure had she had more time and ability, she would have engaged in a more robust way than she’s able to now at this stage,” he said.

“What we’ve learned in previous cycles is that you can’t just do a last-minute appeal to the Hispanic electorate and think that that’s going to do the trick,” he added. “It requires time, cultivation, engagement, and sustainment.”







Another recent survey of Hispanic voters in 22 states conducted by Florida International University and the marketing firm Adsmovil found that 45 percent of those polled prefer Democrats when it comes to immigration, with 29 percent saying that Republicans are better on the issue.

Hispanic voters identify immigration and “open borders” as the biggest threat to the country’s national security, the survey found.

But polls also show Latino voters torn over the state of an economy hit hard by inflation that tends to impact lower income families hardest.

“It appears that Latinos may continue to slide further towards Trump,” Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican in California and host of The Latino Vote podcast, told Al Jazeera.

“Latino voters are rapidly defying the conventional stereotype of who we have typically considered them to be. Latinos are moving away from race and ethnic issues like immigration and towards economic populist and pocketbook issues,” he added.

As the nation’s largest minority group — 19.5 percent of the total population, according to the 2020 census — Latinos form a steadily growing voting bloc in what’s shaping up to be a tight presidential election. While hardly monolithic, the Latino vote is crucial in some battleground states like Florida, Arizona and Nevada. Trump won Florida in 2020 thanks also to awave of supportfrom Hispanic and Latino voters.

“There are more than 36 million Hispanics eligible to vote in the US, making them the largest minority in the country,” Daniel Coronell, president of Noticias Univision, said in a statement prior to the town hall. “[They have] the power to influence the outcome of the race for the White House and the future of the nation”.







Hombres con Harris

As she courts Hispanic voters, Harris has especially focused on men, the group more likely to turn to Trump. Her campaign began a group this week known as “Hombres con Harris”.

The campaign has also aimed to reach Hispanic voters who may not be closely following the election by doing things like having Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris’s campaign manager, attend the recent boxing match between Canelo Alvarez and Edgar Berlanga in Las Vegas, and holding events at churches and elsewhere to mark Mexican Independence Day in September.

Harris’s campaign also announced last month that it was spending $3m on Spanish-language radio advertisements and focusing on sporting events, such as baseball games and boxing matches.

Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, attended an Hombres kickoff event with Arizona Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego and actor Jaime Camil in Phoenix, Arizona on Wednesday. Similar gatherings were held elsewhere in Arizona, as well as in Nevada and Pennsylvania.







More than six in 10 Latinos voters supported Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, and 35 percent supported Trump. However, a July poll from the Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research found only about four in 10 Latinos said they were somewhat or very optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party, and about one-quarter said the same about the Republican Party.

Harris has recovered some of the Latino votes lost by Biden, according to a Univision News/YouGov poll from August. She has also won the endorsement of the League of United Latin American Citizens — the first time the country’s oldest Latino civil rights group has endorsed a presidential candidate since its founding in 1929.

“We can trust them to do what is right for our community and the country,” Domingo Garcia, chairman of LULAC Adelante PAC and LULAC’s immediate past president, said in a statement. “The politics of hate mongering and scapegoating Latinos and immigrants must be stopped!”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/10/kamala-harris-to-appeal-to-latino-voters-at-las-vegas-town-hall,NEGATIVE,0.8270746469497681
Kamala Harris,Could US port strike be the ‘October surprise’ that trips up Kamala Harris?,"Politics watchers in the United States have long spoken about the “October surprise” that has the potential to upend the presidential race in the final stretch.

With 45,000 dock workers going onstrike at dozens of ports across the US, such a moment may have arrived.

The decision by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) union to walk off the job on Tuesday threatens to unleash economic chaos just weeks out from the November 5 vote.

Operations have come to a halt at 36 ports on the East and Gulf coasts, stretching from Texas to Maine, which together handle more than half of imports by sea.

While shoppers are not likely to notice any immediate changes at the checkout, a prolonged strike would play havoc with supply chains, resulting in shortages and higher prices for consumers.

Goods most at risk range from seafood and bananas, to clothing, electronics, cars and pharmaceuticals.

JPMorgan estimated ahead of the strike that a shutdown of the East and Gulf coast ports could cost the economy $5bn a day.

ILA President Harold Daggett has warned that the striking workers could “cripple” the economy if the union’s demands for a 77 percent pay rise over six years and a halt to port automation projects are not met.

“Cars won’t come in, food won’t come in, clothing won’t come in,” Daggett said in remarks broadcast on Fox News. “You know how many people depend on our jobs? Half the world.”

President Joe Biden, who has cast himself as the most pro-union leader in US history, has expressed support for the workers’ demands and rebuffed calls to use powers contained in the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act to order them back to work.

All of this spells potential danger for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party nominee, at the very moment she is gaining voters’ trust on economic issues.

Recent polls have shown Harris, who is narrowly ahead in most surveys of the race, closing the gap with former President Donald Trump on who is best suited to handle the economy, which has long been viewed as one of the Democrat’s biggest vulnerabilities.

One likely reason for this is that US consumers, who laid much of the blame for higher prices on Biden, are starting to feel less of a squeeze on their wallets.

After peaking at 9.1 percent in mid-2022, inflation fell to just 2.2 percent in August, its lowest in more than three and a half years.

The US Federal Reserve last month announced its first interest rate cut in four years, a powerful signal that concerns about runaway prices are finally in the rearview mirror.

A spike in prices just as voters are heading to the polls would strike at perceptions that the economy has turned the corner on the Democrats’ watch.

Much of the risk for Harris would hinge on whether voters viewed her more as part of the incumbent administration or the candidate for change she has sought to portray to the public.

Harris is an unusual nominee given her late entry into the race following Biden’s withdrawal in July, but there is some evidence that voters see her as representing a continuation of the current administration.

In a New York Times/Siena poll published earlier this month, 55 percent of respondents said that Harris represented “more of the same,” compared with 34 percent who said the same about Trump.

Inevitably, Trump wasted no time trying to tie the strike to Harris, blaming the work stoppage on the “massive inflation created by the Harris-Biden regime”.

“Everybody understands the dockworkers because they were decimated by this inflation, just like everybody else in our country and beyond,” Trump told Fox News Digital shortly after the strike began.

Any effort by Harris to differentiate herself from Biden on the strike would carry its own risks, not least alienating union members who have traditionally voted Democrat.

Those are voters that Harris may be especially hesitant to take for granted after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the country’s biggest unions, last month broke with its tradition of supporting Democrats by declining to endorse a candidate for the first time in nearly three decades.

While it is impossible to know how the strike will affect the outcome of the election, the Harris campaign will not be happy about having to handle such a surprise with just five weeks to go.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/10/2/could-us-port-strike-be-the-october-surprise-that-trips-up-kamala-harris,NEGATIVE,0.9950157999992371
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States Vice President Kamala Harris is leading former President Donald Trump as she prepares for her headline moment at theDemocratic National Convention, opinion polling shows.

On the eve of the conventionin Chicago, Harris holds a lead of between three and six percentage points in the race for the White House, two opinion polls showed on Sunday.

Harris is ahead of Trump by 49-45 percent among registered voters and 51-45 percent among likely voters in a two-way race, according to an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.

In a five-way race that includes Robert F Kennedy, Cornel West and Jill Stein, Harris leads Trump 47-44 percent among registered voters and 49-45 percent among likely voters.

In a CBS News poll, Harris is three points ahead nationally, leading Trump 51-48 percent.

In the seven battleground states considered pivotal to the outcome of the election – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina – Harris and Trump are tied 50-50.

The polls are the latest sign that Harris’s late entry into the race has energised Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters after months of poor polling for President Joe Biden, who dropped his re-election bid last month amid concerns about his fitness to serve a second term.

On Saturday, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed Harris in contention in the “Sun Belt” states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, which had been leaning heavily towards Trump when Biden was the Democratic nominee.

Before heading to Chicago on Sunday, Harris held several campaign events in Pennsylvania, whose 20 electoral votes flipped from Trump to Biden in 2020.

“I very much consider us the underdogs,” Harris said at a campaign stop in the township of Moon.

“We have a lot of work to do to earn the vote of the American people. That’s why we’re on this bus tour today and we’re going to be travelling this country as we’ve been and talking with folks, listening to folks and hopefully earning their votes over the next 79 days.”

Speaking at a campaign in Pennsylvania a day earlier, Trump criticised Harris on inflation and her previous opposition to fracking, which is popular in the state, while also launching a series of personal attacks.

“People say, ‘Be nice’. Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person… It’s the laugh of a lunatic,” Trump said.

While Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, were formally nominated in a roll-call vote earlier this month, the four-day convention that kicks off on Monday will give Democrats an opportunity to display unity and drum up enthusiasm among voters.

Biden, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former First Lady Michelle Obama are among the Democratic luminaries scheduled to address the convention.

Although Democrats have quickly coalesced around Harris, the Democratic nominee is expected to face demonstrations over the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza on the sidelines of the convention.

Dozens of Democratic delegates calling themselves “Delegates Against Genocide” have said that they will use the convention to press for an embargo on US arms sales to Israel.

The Democrats’ draft platform released last month calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war, without mentioning the Palestinian death toll or calling for a halt to US arms shipments to Israel.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/19/harris-leads-trump-in-polls-on-eve-of-democratic-national-convention,POSITIVE,0.9956037998199463
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"US presidential candidate Donald Trump has stirred a new racial controversy after asserting that Vice President Kamala Harris turned to her Black identity recently out of political expediency.

Speaking at a convention of Black journalists in Chicago on Wednesday, the former presidentclaimedthatHarris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, had promoted her Indian heritage until very recently.

Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called his comments divisive.

So what happened and has Trump done this before? Here is what we know:

“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Convention.

“I’ve known her a long time indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage,” Trump said.

“I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a Black person,” he said. “I think somebody should look into that, too.”

Trump also accused a panel moderator, Rachel Scott – the senior congressional correspondent for ABC News – of being “rude” and presenting a “nasty question”.

“You have used words like animal and rabid to describe Black district attorneys,” Scott said.

“You’ve attacked Black journalists calling them a loser, saying the questions that they ask are stupid and racist … you’ve had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort.

“So my question, sir, now that you are asking Black supporters to vote for you, why should Black voters trust you?” Scott said.

To which Trump responded: “I’ve never been asked a question in such a horrible manner.”

The interview took place less than three weeks before the Democratic National Convention later this month, when the party is expected to formally nominate Harris and her running mate. This appearance provided Trump with an opportunity to address Black voters.

According to an Axios reporter, his interview, which was meant to last an hour, wascut shortby his team after 34 minutes.

Trump’s appearance at the NABJ Convention was an attempt to reach out to Black voters, but the heated panel exchanges may backfire on the former president, who is likely to face off against Harris in the November elections.

Harris, 59, has long embraced her Black and South Asian identity.

She is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother – both immigrants.

According to areportby The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), she was raised in a predominantly Black neighbourhood in Berkeley, California, because her mother believed that her daughters would eventually be recognised as Black women and wanted them to be surrounded by strong role models.

In her youth, she also attended Howard University, a historically Black institution in Washington, DC, and joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation’s oldest sorority established for Black college women in 1908.

Harris became a member of the Congressional Black Caucus after entering the Senate in 2017.

“I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black,” Harris said in 2019. “I was born Black. I will die Black, and I’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand.”

Later on Wednesday, speaking in Houston at a gathering of Sigma Gamma Rho, the Black sorority’s gathering of its entire membership in Texas,  Harris responded to Trump’s claims.

“Donald Trump spoke at the annual meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists,” Harris said.

“And it was the same old show: the divisiveness and the disrespect. And let me just say, the American people deserve better. The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth. A leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the facts. We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide us – they are an essential source of our strength.”

Yes. Shortly after the event, the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also reacted to Trump’s comments.

“As a person of colour, as a Black woman who is in this position,” Jean-Pierre said, “what he just said … is repulsive. It’s insulting,” she added.

“No one has any right to tell someone who they are.”

“She is the vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris. We have to put some respect on her name, period,” Jean-Pierre added.

Trump’s comments reflect his earlier attacks on Black political opponents, such as the“birtherism” conspiracy theorythat falsely claimed former President Barack Obama was not born in the US. This was the beginning of Trump challenging the credentials of Black politicians.

According to experts this type of claims and conspiracy theories can be dangerous.

“Social science research shows that these kinds of claims cannot be un-made after the fact,” Paul Rosenbergwrote for Al Jazeerain 2012. “Once out there, they never go away,” he added.

Winning over Black voters is crucial for both candidates.

Trump partly won his race against Hillary Clinton in 2016 partly because fewer Black and Latino voters turned out to vote,accordingto Pew Research. The Democratic Party has traditionally received more than 80 percent of Black votes.

In 2020, 92 percent of Black voters chose Joe Biden, while only 8 percent backed Trump.

According to areportby ABC, Black voters currently make up at least10 percent of the populationin several key states likely to influence this year’s election, including Michigan and Florida. In states like Georgia, Black Americans account for a third of eligible voters,accordingto a Pew research. So small changes in the vote could sway the election.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/1/did-kamala-harris-shy-from-her-black-identity-truth-behind-trump-claims,NEGATIVE,0.9656678438186646
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"During her interview with the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) on Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris criticised former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Republican Senator JD Vance, forspreading misinformationabout Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

In the presidential debate held last week, Trump claimed that immigrants in the Midwestern state wereeating residents’ pets.

“When you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand how much your words have meaning,” Harris said on Tuesday. “I learned at a very young stage of my career that the meaning of my words could impact whether someone was free or in prison.”

On Israel’s war on Gaza, Harrisreiteratedthat Israel has a right to defend itself, following Hamas’s October 7 attack last year, but didn’t have a straight answer for co-moderator and Politico White House Correspondent Eugene Daniels’ question about how her policies would differ from President Joe Biden’s. Harris said “We need to get this deal done,” referring to freeing captives and a ceasefire deal.

The discussion took place at US public radio station WHYY in downtown Philadelphia and featured Daniels, theGrio White House correspondent and Managing Editor of Politics Gerren Keith Gaynor and WHYY Fresh Air programme co-host Tonya Mosley as moderators.

Harris’s interview happened days afterTrump was targetedin an apparent assassination attempt. Harris said she spoke to Trump earlier in the day.

“There’s no place for political violence in our country,” Harris said.

In addition to these topics, the moderators tried to get specifics from Harris about her positions on the economy and healthcare. We fact-checked several of her claims.

When Harris and Biden took office, replacing Trump, the US had “the worst unemployment since the Great Depression”.

False.

Harris had also made this claim during the presidential debate against Trump. She’s wrong. The USunemployment ratespiked to a post-Great Depression record of 14.8 percent in April 2020, as the pandemic escalated. Trump was in office then. But by December 2020, before Biden and Harris took office, the unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent – high for recent history but well below numerous spikes during recessions.

Harris:“We have the lowest Black unemployment rate in generations.”

Half True.

The Black unemployment rate in August, the most recent month available, was 6.1 percent. That’s low by historical standards, though it’s up from a record low of 4.8 percent set in April 2023.

Black unemployment was also low under Trump, which was not “generations” ago. Trump set a record low of 5.3 percent in September 2019 which was later eclipsed by the record low under Biden.

Harris:“When we expanded the Child Tax Credit a couple years ago, we reduced Back child poverty by half.”

Mostly True.

The White House, after Biden made a similar claim in February 2023, said Black child poverty fell from 17.2 percent in 2020 to 8.3 percent in 2021, a 52 percent drop. The drop from 2019, the White House said, was 60 percent.

The White House cited supplemental poverty numbers from the Census Bureau. The supplemental poverty measure, introduced in 2011, updated the official poverty measure, which was based on cash resources. The supplemental poverty measure includes cash and non-cash benefits and accounts for government programmes designed to aid low-income families.

Biden’s American Rescue Plan increased the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 for children younger than six and to $3,000 for children aged six to 17. Beneficiaries, which included families with very low incomes that weren’t required to file tax returns, received up to half the credit in monthly payments from July 2021 to December 2021.

The provision lapsed after that, facing opposition from Republicans and independent Senator Joe Manchin, who said expanding the credit would worsen inflation. When the expanded tax credit expired, child poverty spiked. Supplemental child poverty rose from 12.1 percent in December 2021 to 17 percent in January 2022 – a 41 percent change. This meant 3.7 million more children were living below the poverty line in 2022 compared with 2021.







Harris:“As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.”

Mostly True.

Non-farm employment has increased by about 15.9 million jobs from January 2021 to August 2024, the period that Biden and Harris have been in office. Manufacturing employment has risen by 739,000.

However, there are a few caveats.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates how many people are working, said in August that the initial statistics may have overstated job gains by 818,000. This revision was part of the bureau’s annual effort to fine-tune initial data that the agency acknowledges is imperfect.

That would reduce the job gains to about 15 million jobs, not 16 million. But for now, the old numbers Harris was using are the official ones. Any changes would be finalised early next year.

Another caveat is that no president can claim full credit for job gains on their watch (or job losses). Many factors that go into employment changes stem from developments beyond presidents’ control, including the health of the global economy.

Harris:“We know Black folks are 60 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.”

True.

Black adults in 2018 were 60 percent more likely than non-Hispanic white adults to be diagnosed with diabetes by a physician, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows. In 2019, Black adults were 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalised with the condition and have associated long-term complications. The group was also twice as likely as non-Hispanic white people to die from the disease, the data shows.

The American Diabetes Association also found that the prevalence of diabetes in non-Hispanic Black people is 11.7 percent, versus 7.5 percent in non-Hispanic white people.

One 2018 Northwestern University study found that biological risk factors for diabetes, such as body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose level and blood pressure, accounted for most of the health disparities in Black communities. Differences between Black people and white people in neighbourhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic and behavioural factors were also linked with diabetes, although to a lesser degree, researchers said.

Harris:“One in four Black families or individuals … carry medical debt.”

Mostly True.

Estimates vary, but several research groups found percentages broadly in line with what Harris said. The Urban Institute found a rate of 22.5 percent, the Commonwealth Fund cited a 28 percent figure, and the Brookings Institution said the rate is 27 percent. (All three organisations are think tanks.)

KFF, a healthcare research group, found a lower percentage: 13 percent.

Harris:“Black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women.”

True.

Black women in the US have amaternal mortality rateof 49.5 for every 100,000 live births – nearly three times higher than their non-Hispanic white counterparts – according to the CDC.

The US has the highest maternal mortality rate among economically comparable nations, data shows, with an overall rate in 2022 of 22.3 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.

Reasons behind the country’s high maternal mortality numbers and its racial disparity include a lack of healthcare coverage, no guaranteed paid parental leave, less robust postpartum care and racial discrimination.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/fact-check-was-kamala-harris-truthful-in-interview-with-black-journalists,NEGATIVE,0.9754648804664612
Kamala Harris,Women’s groups vow to fight sexist attacks against Kamala Harris,"In the weeks before Joe Biden named Senator Kamala Harris his running mate in the United States election, women’s groups were readying a campaign of their own: shutting down sexist coverage and disinformation about a vice presidential nominee they say is headed for months of false smears and “brutal” attacks from internet haters.

The groups put the media on notice in recent days that they will call out bias – one campaign is dubbed “We Have Her Back” – and established a “war room” to refute sexist or false attacks as they happen.









They did not have to wait long. Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee’s announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a “racist” and that she is not eligible to be president.









The women’s groups say their efforts are informed by the sexism former candidate Hillary Clinton faced from President Donald Trump, some of his supporters and the media during the 2016 campaign.

“This time we understand the patterns, and this time we have the organisational infrastructure to push back,” said Shaunna Thomas, executive director of the women’s advocacy group UltraViolet, which released a 32-page guide for media along with a coalition of groups including Color of Change PAC, Planned Parenthood Votes and Women’s March.

While the groups have primarily been led by Democrats, their efforts are backed by nonpartisan groups and some Republicans.

The war room will call out bias and disinformation against women in both parties up and down the ballot, said Tina Tchen, CEO of Time’s Up Now, which fights sexual harassment in the workplace.

The groups say intense scrutiny of a vice presidential nominee is to be expected, but women are often unfairly criticised as overly emotional, weak or unqualified, or for their appearance or demeanor in a way that men are not. The attacks, which include false smears and threats of violence online, not only hurt campaigns but also dissuade women from seeking office.

Christine Todd Whitman, a former New Jersey governor and Republican, said Biden’s running mate will be at the centre of an “ugly” social media campaign from online bullies.

“This is going to be brutal because these platforms allow people to do things anonymously, saying things anonymously,” Whitman said.

If elected, Harris would be the country’s first Black vice president. Her mother is from India and her father is from Jamaica. That has invited not only sexist but also racist commentary and misinformation around her candidacy.









Harris, who was born in Oakland, California, has been the victim of online falsehoods for more than a year that say she is not eligible to become president because her parents were not born in the US. More recently, Facebook users added a new twist to the misinformation: that since Harris is not eligible to be president, if Biden did not finish his term, the presidency would automatically default to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.

There is no truth to that – Harris is a natural-born US citizen who’s eligible to be president – yet the misinformation has been shared by thousands of Facebook users. Facebook has labelled the posts as false but has not removed them from its platform.

The misinformation calls to mind the conspiracy theories in 2008 around Democrat Barack Obama, the first Black US president, that claimed he was born in Kenya, not the US. Those claims were amplified by Trump, then a reality TV star, and gained so much traction during the campaign that Obama produced a birth certificate showing he was born in Honolulu.

The latest attacks on Harris’s citizenship were highlighted in a letter from more than 100 female lawmakers from across the world that was sent to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. It called on them to remove misinformation, as well as posts or accounts that threaten women.

“Much of the most hateful content directed at women on Facebook is amplified by your algorithms which reward extreme and dangerous points of view with greater reach and visibility,” said the letter, which was spearheaded by Democratic Representative Jackie Speier of California.

Cindy Southworth, Facebook’s head of women’s safety, said the company will work with the lawmakers to “surface new solutions”.

“Abuse of women on the internet is a serious problem, one we tackle in a variety of ways: through technology that identifies and removes potentially abusive content before it happens, by enforcing strict policies, and by talking with experts to ensure we stay ahead of new tactics,” she said.

Now that we know Senator Kamala Harris will be Biden's running mate, the media must be prepared to report the election without relying on sexist, racist tropes.

But mere minutes after Harris was announced as Biden’s running mate, pro-Trump social media personalities and conservative news outlets claimed Harris called Biden a racist during a televised Democratic debate last year. In reality, she said, “I do not believe you’re a racist,” before criticising his past opposition to policies around school desegregation.

The road to becoming Biden’s running mate had been littered with misleading online attacks on women under consideration.

Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice was accused of committing crimes in office, and Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who authorised strict stay-at-home orders in her state this year, was pelted with memes and images likening her to Adolf Hitler or an “evil queen.”

Harris is likely prepared for the onslaught ahead after watching how 2016 unfolded on social media, said Sarah Oates, a political communications professor at the University of Maryland.

“She is going to be vilified, no matter who she is,” Oates said. “In 2020, people are much more attuned and aware of it. That doesn’t mean it’s going to make it better, but at least you can be more aware of the toxicity.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/12/womens-groups-vow-to-fight-sexist-attacks-against-kamala-harris,NEGATIVE,0.9947540760040283
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Democraticpresidential candidateKamala Harrishas made her last appeal to voters, holding a series of rallies in battleground Pennsylvania, with a final, glitzy event in the city of Philadelphia, where producer-actress Oprah Winfrey introduced her.

In her fifth and final event late on Monday night,Harristold a large crowd she was ready to represent the next generation of leadership in the United States.

“But this race is not over, and we must finish strong,” she said.

“And this could be one of the closest races in history. Every single vote matters.”

Winfrey appeared on stage at the event at the Philadelphia Museum of Art with 10 young people who were all first-time voters.

“[If] you’re feeling burned out and bruised and maybe inconsequential, nothing could be further from the truth. Every single vote, everyone is going to matter,” said Winfrey. “That’s why I’ve come to Philadelphia tonight.”

As she closed her address, Harris said voters had a chance in this election to finally “turn the page on a decade of politics that has been driven by fear and division”.

“We are done with that. We’re done [and] we’re exhausted with it,” she said.

“America is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward, where we see our fellow Americans not as an enemy.”

Throughout the day, Harris’s message had been consistent – every vote was crucial in the state that holds 19Electoral Collegevotes, the most of all the seven swing states that will likely determine the outcome.

“We need everyone in Pennsylvania to vote,” she said to an exuberant afternoon crowd in Allentown. “You are going to make the difference in this election.”

The polls have Harris essentially tied in Pennsylvania with her Republican rival, former PresidentDonald Trump,who held one of his final rallies in Reading, Pennsylvania, only a few kilometres away from Harris.

Over the last few days, Harris has sought to further differentiate her campaign from Trump’s by not mentioning his name, and emphasising optimism and community.

“Momentum is on our side, momentum is on our side, can you feel it? We have momentum, right?” she said to cheers.

“Because our campaign has tapped into the ambitions and aspirations and the dreams of the American people, we are optimistic and excited about what we will do together.”

Harris, 60, could make US history as the first woman, the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian descent to reach the Oval Office. Four years ago, she broke the same barriers in national office by becoming President Joe Biden’s second-in-command.

Harris’s last day was all about encouraging supporters to vote and think about the future.

“It’s time for a new generation of leadership in America, and I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America,” she said.







Harris’s Allentown rally was introduced by Grammy Award-winning musician Fat Joe, who was raised by parents of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. He wasted no time in taking aim at the racist remarks that featured at the recent Republican rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden.

“That was no joke ladies and gentlemen. That was no joke, filled with so much hate,” he said.

ComedianTony Hinchcliffe, who was part of Trump’s warm-up act at the New York rally, created a firestorm of protests when he called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage”.

Southeast Pennsylvania is home to thousands of Latinos, including a sizeable Puerto Rican population. Harris and her allies have repeatedly hit at Trump for those comments.

Fat Joe reminded the Allentown rally that people can make their feelings clear when they vote.

“My Latinos, where is your pride,” he asked.

“If I am speaking to undecided Puerto Ricans, especially in Pennsylvania, what more do they gotta do to show you who they are? If I tell you that Kamala Harris is with us, she’s with us.”

On Monday, Harris told supporters: “I stand here proud of my longstanding commitment to Puerto Rico and her people and I will be a president for all Americans.”

Harris also swung by Scranton – the birthplace of Biden.

“Are you ready to do this?” she yelled to supporters there, with a large handmade “Vote For Freedom” sign behind her and a similar “VOTE” banner to her side.

Throughout the whirlwind last day, Harris repeated one of the slogans of her campaign – “We Are Not Going Back”. It is designed, in part, to contrast her with Republicans who supported the US Supreme Court decision that overturned a national right to an abortion.

She repeated her promise to protect women’s reproductive rights.

“We are not going back because ours is the fight for the future, for freedom, like the fundamental freedom for a woman to make decisions over her own body and not have the government tell her what to do,” Harris said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/kamala-harris-makes-final-push-for-votes-in-battleground-pennsylvania,POSITIVE,0.9949079155921936
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Since Kamala Harris emerged as the Democratic presidential frontrunner – and then the party’s official candidate – following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race a little more than a month ago, donations for her campaign have been pouring in.

Harris’s campaign said this week that it had raised about $540m in that time – the largest amount raised by any political campaign in such a short period of time.









This fundraising milestone is significant, said Patrick Frank, former outreach director of ActBlue, the largest online fundraising platform for the Democratic Party and outreach director for Lunda, a platform for small donors fundraising in Europe.

“It is definitely one of one. This is a unique amount,” he told Al Jazeera. The only parallel? “I would say that there’s probably some comparison out there to disaster relief funds that are able to generate just as much,” he added.

But in a country where political campaigns are often beholden to large fundraising machines known as super PACs, the Harris campaign also stands out for the dramatic flood of money it is receiving from small donors.

Of the $497m in funding that Harris received as of August 20, roughly 42 percent of the money had come from 631,000 such small donors – those who contribute less than $200 – according to Open Secrets, a non-for-profit organisation based in Washington, DC that tracks and publishes data related on political campaign financing.

In all, candidates for the 2024 US presidential election across the political spectrum have raised roughly $1.5bn so far from small and large donors.



Overall, Harris has built a commanding funding lead over former President Donald Trump, her Republican opponent in the November election.

According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, by the end of July, Harris had approximately$489min her war chest, compared with$265m for Trump.

In just the week of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, from August 19 to August 22, when Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, accepted their nominations, their campaign drew $82m in funding, according to a memo from Jen O’Malley Dillon, Harris’s campaign manager.

“This is the most ever for any presidential campaign in this time span,” Dillon said.

And Harris also leads Trump when it comes to small donors: The entrepreneur-turned-politician has secured 32 percent of his campaign funding from small donors, compared with Harris’s 42 percent.

Yet Harris still lags behind one previous campaign when it comes to small donor support: During his 2008 run, Barack Obama received roughly 44 percent of his funding from small donors, according to Open Secrets. And Obama bettered that record during his re-election campaign.

In 1971, the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) was passed to regulate campaign financing. It required candidates to disclose their contributions and spending for their election campaigns.

Although the FECA did not explicitly track small donations at the time, a small donation can range anywhere from $1 to $200 sent to a candidate’s political campaign or a political action committee.

In a working paper (not peer-reviewed) published (PDF) by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit organisation, and updated in July 2024, economists Laurent Bouton, Julia Cage, Edgard Dewitte and Vincent Pons tried to break down the demographics of small donors.

They found that “small donors tend to be more representative of the overall population than large donors”.

According to Frank, it was Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, who ran for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, who brought small donations to the fore.

“One of the keys to Kamala Harris’s fundraising is the media attention driving the narrative but with Dean, it was actually the fundraising driving the media,” he said.

Yet small donations really took off with Barak Obama’s 2007 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, when he raised a total of $750m, with roughly $335m coming from small donors, according to Open Secrets.

By Obama’s 2011 primary run for the 2012 US presidential election, the amount contributed by small donors had surged to almost 50 percent. In the process, he doubled the amount of small-donor donations he had received four years earlier.

Candidates who pitch themselves as outsiders, and take on key corporates and Wall Street often end up depending disproportionately on small donors.

According to theGuardian in February 2020, Bernie Sanders managed to raise $10m through from 350,000 first-time donors within a week of launching his 2020 presidential campaign. On average, each contribution amounted to approximately $27.

According to Frank, Sanders would likely have won a lot more from small donors had he secured the 2020 Democratic Party nomination, which went to Biden.

Although political activist Cornel West, competing for the presidency in 2024, has not raised anywhere close to the hundreds of millions of dollars secured by Harris or Trump, he has received 53 percent of the $1.1m in his campaign chest from small donors, according to Open Secrets.

Though he trails Harris, Trump retains strong support from small donors, said analysts.

“Donald Trump has been one of the most successful small donor fundraisers of the last decade,” Frank said. “He’s in the top three. It’s going to be Harris, Biden, Trump, Bernie.”

And while Harris is far ahead in overall funding, there too, Trump has had his moments of surge – including among small donors.

After Trump was convicted on 34 felony charges in Manhattan in May, the Trump campaign announced that it had raised $52.8m within 24 hours. This overwhelming surge of donations caused the WinRed platform, a platform for accepting small GOP donations, to crash due to the high traffic it received.

Yet in July, Trump’s campaign raised $139m, far less than the $310m reported by the Harris campaign, despite the focus on the Republican National Convention and an assassination attempt on Trump.

Campaigns have been able to utilise social media and online platforms in ways that were much harder in a pre-digital era, analysts said, resulting in a shift towards small-dollar online donations. Digital technology has made it easier for campaigns to reach a wide audience and mobilise grassroots support, and for small donors to contribute financially.

Whether small donors will be able to compete with large donors in terms of political influence remains unclear, but Frank remains optimistic.

“My vision for what an ideal situation would be looks a lot like the Elizabeth Warren campaign in 2020,” he said. Warren, according to Frank, had enough wealthy donors lining up. “But the rule on the campaign was there are no advantages to the amount that you gave me.”

That, he said, should be the goal for political campaigns.

“If you can give more, give more, but don’t expect anything in return for it,” he said. “I already think we’re at a place in the Democratic Party where big donors are frustrated that they don’t have the influence that they [think they should] have.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/30/more-than-200bn-how-kamala-harris-is-winning-the-small-donors-battle,POSITIVE,0.9979932308197021
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Vice President Kamala Harris has raised $540m in little more than a month sinceshe began her racefor United States president, with a surge of donations during the Democratic National Convention last week, her campaign said.

A memo released by Harris’s campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, said the $540m raised included $82m that came in during convention week and was a sign of Democratic enthusiasm for her candidacy.

“Just before Vice President Harris’acceptance speechThursday night, we officially crossed the $500 million mark,” O’Malley Dillon wrote in a memo released by the campaign on Sunday.

“Immediately after her speech, we saw our best fundraising hour since launch day.”

“This is the most ever for any presidential campaign in this time span,” she added.

O’Malley Dillon said that nearly a third of contributions during convention week came from first-time contributors. About one-fifth of those first-time contributors were young voters and two-thirds were women, groups the campaign sees as critical constituencies that Harris needs to turn out to win in November.

The Harris campaign says it has also seen a surge in volunteer support for the vice president. During convention week, supporters signed up for nearly 200,000 volunteer shifts to help the campaign.

Harris became candidate for president on July 21 when PresidentJoe Biden stepped asideunder pressure from fellow Democrats concerned about his age after he stumbled during a June 27 debate against Republican rival Donald Trump.

The Harris candidacy has generated momentum that has put Trump on the defensive and left him struggling to maintain media attention.

Trump has also proven a formidable fundraiser, but at the moment appears to be outpaced by Harris’s month-old campaign.

Trump’s campaign and its related affiliates announced earlier this month that they had raised $138.7m in July – less than what Harris took in during her White House bid’s opening week. Trump’s campaign reported $327m in cash on hand at the start of August.

Harris and her vice presidential running mate,Tim Walz, take their campaign for the White House on a bus tour through Georgia this week, looking to build support in a state looming large in the November 5 election.

Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris sees US at ‘inflexion point’ in upcoming elections,"The Democratic Party has made history by nominating Kamala Harris as its vice presidential candidate, as an array of party leaders laid out their case for Joe Biden to be the next president of the United States and urged people to organise and vote.

Democrats must defeat President Donald Trump in the November election or face a chaotic, destructive future amid a deadly pandemic and a rising climate crisis, Harris and a parade of Democrats including women, immigrants and young people warned on the third night of the virtual Democratic National Convention.









“We’re at an inflexion point,” Harris said in her acceptance speech on Wednesday in a direct attack on Trump.

“Right now we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons,” Harris said. “Constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone. It’s a lot. And here’s the thing – we can do better and deserve so much more,” Harris said.

“We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better, and do the important work – a president who will bring all of us together – Black, white, Latino, Asian, Indigenous – to achieve the future we collectively want,” Harris said.

The daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, Harris is thefirst woman of colourto be nominated as a candidate for vice president by a major US party – Republican or Democrat. Harris’s remarks capped a night of appearances by big-name Democratic politicians in support of Biden’s candidacy.

Harris spoke passionately about the strength of her late mother Shyamala who conveyed values of activism to her and she testified about her love of family.

“She came across as really genuine. There was a warmth to it that counterbalances her image as a tough person,” Courtney Burns, an associate professor of political science at Bucknell University, told Al Jazeera.

Harris’s selection as vice president “showed diversity and connection”, Burns said.

Former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared by satellite feed on the penultimate night of the virtual convention.

“Tonight, I am asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of dark times and build it back better,” Obama said in a speech that recounted his time in the White House with Biden as his number two.

“Over eight years, Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president. He’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country,” Obama said, lauding Biden’s humility and resilience.

Obama warned darkly that the Trump administration “has shown it will tear our democracy down if that’s what it takes to win” and he urged Democrats to organise and vote in the election.

“What we do echoes through the generations,” Obama said.

In an email to reporters, Trump’s re-election campaign said Biden and Harris are leading “the most far-left presidential ticket in American history” and are “total failures”.

Among Democrats’ concerns ahead of the November polls, there has been a new outcry as a Trump-appointee has taken steps that could slow down the US Postal Service at a time when millions of voters could attempt to cast ballots by mail to avoid potential exposure to COVID-19.

The US is struggling with the coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 5.5 million Americans and killed more than 173,000 – a higher toll than in any other country. Democrats say Trump failed to lead an effective response.

“There’s a lot of heartbreak in America right now – and the truth is, many things were broken before the pandemic,” said former Democratic presidential candidate Clinton who lost her 2016 bid to be the first woman president.

“For four years, people have said to me, ‘I didn’t realize how dangerous he was.’ ‘I wish I could go back and do it over.’ Or worse, ‘I should have voted’,” Clinton said, urging Biden supporters to commit to voting.

“This can’t be another woulda-coulda-shoulda election,” Clinton said. “No matter what, vote. Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line, because they are.”

Biden and the Democrats are promising to bring a range of new policies on gun control, immigration reform, clean energy to address climate change and racial and economic justice.

Silvia Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant in North Carolina, appeared by video feed during the virtual convention with her daughters Jessica, who is a Dreamer, and Lucy.

Sanchez crossed the Rio Grande river into the US holding one of her daughters, who has spina bifida, a life-threatening birth defect, above the water. Today, they are battling for citizenship and healthcare.

Hearing the voices of women leaders was a persistent theme in Wednesday night’s proceedings.

House Speaker Pelosi led the impeachment charge against Trump and has been on the receiving end of his insults.

“As Speaker, I’ve seen first-hand Donald Trump’s disrespect for facts, for working families – and for women in particular – disrespect written into his policies toward our health and our rights, not just his conduct,” Pelosi said.

“But we know what he doesn’t – that when women succeed, America succeeds,” Pelosi said.

Wednesday’s event also featured stars from the world of entertainment, with actor Kerry Washington hosting and teenage pop sensation Billie Eilish performing her new single, My Future, for the first time.

“Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about. We need leaders who will solve problems like climate change and COVID, not deny them, leaders who will fight against systemic racism and inequality,” Eilish said, urging people to vote in November’s poll.

Democrats are nearing the climax of a four-day national convention designed to appeal to a broad coalition of Americans on a centre-left political spectrum with an added pitch to some Republicans who are unhappy with Trump’s unconventional conduct.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has promised to “bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans” in one of her first major policy speeches in the United States presidential campaign.

The US vice president, who secured the Democratic nomination after President Joe Bidendropped outof the race last month, put forward a set of proposals on Friday that she said would help boost the economy and combat food “price gouging”.

“I will be laser-focused on creating opportunities for the middle class,” Harris told a crowd of supporters in North Carolina. “Together, we will build what I call an opportunity economy.”

The plan includes an effort to end so-called price hikes on groceries, with Harris saying she would seek to pass a “first-ever federal ban” on the practice. She also proposed a scheme to provide $25,000 in support for some first-time homebuyers, as well as tax incentives for affordable home builders.

Moreover, Harris backed a $6,000 tax credit for children in their first year of life and an earned tax credit to cover people in lower-income jobs without children. She also renewed Biden’s pledge to lower the price of prescription medications.

The speech on Friday comes as the campaign of former PresidentDonald Trumphas sought to hone in on the economy in its attacks on Harris. The Republican candidate has dubbed Harris “a radical California liberal who broke the economy”.

Trump delivered his own vision of the economy in North Carolina earlier this week, making sweeping promises to “defeat inflation”, end “job-killing regulations” and usher in a level of economic abundance that will “pay off all our debt”.







Trump’s 75-minute speech on Wednesday often devolved into other subjects, includingcriticisms of Biden’sdecision to withdraw from the race and tangents on Harris’s laugh.

Polls have shown that voters are more likely to trust Trump with the economy than Harris.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that 45 percent of respondents felt Trump is better positioned to handle the economy, while 38 percent said the same about Harris.

About one in 10 voters said they trusted neither Harris nor Trump to better handle the economy.

The duelling speeches come as the US economy continues to suffer from high prices in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even as year-over-yearinflationhas reached its lowest level in more than three years, food prices remain at 21 percent above their level from that period. Rental and other housing costs have also continued to rise. Some economists have also warned of an impending recession.

Harris unveiled her plan amid a battleground state blitz, in which she has sought to capitalise on the enthusiasm that accompanied her abrupt entry into the race.

She was officially nominated by the Democratic Party in a virtual roll call earlier this month, and next week, she will formally accept the nomination at theDemocratic National Conventionin Chicago.

Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris decries ‘tragic’ killing of US citizen by Israeli forces,"Washington, DC –Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has decried the killing of American activistAysenur Ezgi Eygiby Israeli forces, but the United States vice president stopped short of endorsing requests for an independent investigation into the incident.

In a statement on Wednesday, Harris called the fatal shooting of Eygi in the occupied West Bank last week “tragic” and “unacceptable”. She also urged “full accountability” for the killing.

“Israel must do more to ensure that incidents like this never happen again,” Harris said.

“Israel’s preliminary investigation indicated it was the result of a tragic error for which the [Israeli military] is responsible. We will continue to press the government of Israel for answers and for continued access to the findings of the investigation so we can have confidence in the results.”

Israeli forces shot Eygi in the head on September 6 while she was protesting against an illegal Israeli outpost in the Palestinian territory.

On Tuesday, the Israeli military acknowledged that it “probably” killed Eygi, but said she was shot “indirectly and unintentionally”.

Eygi, 26, lived in Washington State and has been described by friends as a joyous person who was passionate about social justice.







Rights advocates have long argued that Israel should not be allowed to investigate its own abuses, noting that the country’s authorities rarely prosecute its own soldiers for rampant rights violations against Palestinians.

That is why Eygi’s family had called on the US to conduct its own probe into the killing. But Washington has all but ruled out the request, saying that it isawaiting the resultsof the Israeli investigation.

On Tuesday, both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin described the killing of Eygi as “unprovoked and unjustified”. But their boss, President Joe Biden, was quick to suggest that he accepts the Israeli explanation for the shooting.

“Apparently, it was an accident. It ricocheted off the ground and it — [she] got hit by accident,” he told reporters outside the White House.

He later issued astatementon Wednesday saying the US expects to have “full access” to Israel’s preliminary investigation.

“There must be full accountability. And Israel must do more to ensure that incidents like this never happen again,” Biden wrote in the statement.

None of the US officials — including Harris — has backed an independent probe or committed to seeking consequences for Eygi’s killing.

Eygi is one of several Americans killed by Israel in recent years. Victims include 17-year-oldTawfiq Ajaq, who was shot in January, and veteran Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh, who was killed by Israeli forces in Jenin in 2022.

The US has verbally demanded accountability in these cases but has not applied any penalties to Israel for refusing to open criminal investigations into the incidents.

Israel receives billions of dollars in US military aid annually, as well asdiplomatic supportfrom Washington at international forums.







Biden and Harris have faced criticism this week for failing to call Eygi’s family to express condolences or condemn Israel for killing her.

Critics have also drawn a contrast between the administration’s response to Eygi’s death and the killing of US citizenHersh Goldberg-Polin, who was taken captive during the October 7 attack by Hamas and found dead in a tunnel in Gaza late in August.

After Goldberg-Polin’s death, top Biden administration officials unequivocally condemned his killing, and the US Department of Justice announced new “terrorism” charges against Hamas leaders.

Advocates say this strong reaction only highlights the tepid nature of the US response to Eygi’s killing.

“Aysenur and her family deserve justice. As her family continues to mourn, President Biden and Vice President Harris have chosen to defend the foreign military that killed her instead of calling the family to express their condolences,” Juliette Majid, a friend of Eygi, told Al Jazeera in a statement.

Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris departs from Biden capital gains tax plan to widen her reach,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has proposed raising the capital gains tax rate for those earning $1m or more to 28 percent, instead of the 39.6 percent rate proposed by President Joe Biden in his fiscal 2025 budget.

On Wednesday, Vice President Harris also told cheering supporters at a brewery in North Hampton, New Hampshire, about 10 miles south of Portsmouth, that she would push for a $50,000 tax deduction for new small businesses, 10 times the current tax break.

“As president, one of my highest priorities will be to strengthen America’s small businesses,” Harris said, noting that small businesses employ half of all private sector workers in the United States.

Harris said lowering the cost of starting a new business – estimated at $40,000 on average – would help the US reach her “very ambitious” goal of having 25 million new small business applications filed by the end of her first term.

A record 5.5 million new business applications were filed in 2023, according to the Small Business Administration.

Harris’s proposal for a lower top tax rate on capital gains suggests she wants to appeal to a broader base of voters even as she sticks with most of Biden’s plans to strengthen the middle class. Harris became the Democratic nominee after Biden stepped aside on July 21.

In his fiscal 2025 budget, Biden had proposed raising the tax rate on long-term capital gains – the profits made from selling or trading an asset held for more than a year – to 39.6 percent for those earning more than $1m annually, from the current rates, which range up to 20 percent, depending on income.

Harris said she also plans to offer low- and no-interest loans to small businesses, cut the red tape they face and expand access to venture capital.

She said she supported a minimum tax for billionaires proposed by Biden, adding, “It is not right that those who can afford it are often paying a lower tax rate than our teachers and our nurses and our firefighters,” she said.

Harris took aim at her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, saying his plans would cut off federal programmes that offer loans to small businesses, cut the corporate tax rate and push the US deficit higher.

Recent polls show Harris with a four to six percentage point lead in New Hampshire over Trump ahead of the November 5 election.

Harris spoke at the woman-owned Throwback Brewery, joined by the state’s two female US senators, other elected officials and a leader of a “Republicans for Harris” group in New Hampshire, where 330,000 registered independents outnumber the 258,000 registered Democrats and 301,000 registered Republicans.

New Hampshire has backed a Democratic candidate in every presidential election since 1992, except for former President George W Bush’s 2000 win.

Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt denied a news report that Republicans had given up on the state and said Trump’s campaign had an on-the-ground presence, office and staff there.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/9/4/kamala-harris-departs-from-biden-capital-gains-tax-plan-to-widen-her-reach,NEGATIVE,0.9054572582244873
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Television legend Oprah Winfrey and United States Vice President Kamala Harris shared the stage on Thursday in a event called “Unite for America” to drum up support for Harris’s presidential campaign. Harris is the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate for the November election.

This is not the first time the television personality has voiced support for Harris during this election. She made a surprise speech at theDemocratic National Convention (DNC)last month.

Since emerging as her party’s frontrunner for the presidential nomination, and especially since winning that nomination, Harris has secured the endorsements of hundreds of prominent Americans — from Hollywood stars and music icons to her party’s stalwarts and Republicans who say they cannot vote for their party’s nominee, ex-President Donald Trump.

However, few public figures in the US enjoy an aura like Oprah’s. Here’s more about her history of election endorsements and how much those have influenced outcomes.

A copper blazer-clad, bespectacled Oprah hosted the more-than-one-hour talk-show-style event.

The event took place in Michigan, a key battleground state in this election. It was livestreamed on the Harris campaign YouTube channel and, as of Friday morning in the US, had already been viewed more than one million times.

Harris walked onto the stage, meeting enthusiastic applause from a studio audience. The two women discussed topics, including reproductive health and Harris’s plans to reduce the cost of housing and to lower taxation.

Big names in the entertainment industry — from Jennifer Lopez and Julia Roberts to Chris Rock and Meryl Streep — joined over video-link.

These celebrities add to the star power around the Harris campaign built by celebrities includingTaylor SwiftandCharli XCX, when they endorsed the Democrat earlier.

However, the most potent endorsement possibly comes from Oprah herself.

A 2013 study conducted by economists Craig Garthwaite of Northwestern University and Timothy J Moore from the University of Maryland found that Oprah’s endorsement resulted in about one million additional votes for DemocratBarack Obama, who has also endorsed Harris, in 2008.

The research found that in addition to votes, her support also helped Obama secure additional funding.

In the election, Obama won with nearly 53 percent of the popular vote.

After her first major endorsement of Obama in 2008, Oprah has sporadically endorsed politicians in presidential or senate races.

In 2016, Oprah expressed her support for DemocratHilary Clintonagainst Republican Donald Trump in a media interview.

While Trump trailed Clinton in the 2016 polls, Trump won the election. He won the Electoral College, butlostthe overall popular vote.

In October 2020, Democrat Joe Biden received a boost from Oprah a month before the election, when she hosted a virtual get-out-the-vote event.

In 2022, the talk show host endorsed Democrat John Fetterman in the Pennsylvania Senate race against his Republican opponent Mehmet Oz, who rose to prominence as a celebrity doctor by appearing on her talk show. Her endorsement took the form of avirtual event, conducted on Zoom.

Fetterman won the race.

But the TV diva’s endorsement is no golden ticket. During the same virtual event in which she endorsed Fetterman, she briefly expressed support for other Democratic candidates for Senate and governor races. These included: Cheri Beasley for North Carolina, Val Demings for Florida, Mandela Barnes for Wisconsin, Catherine Cortez Masto for Nevada, Beto O’Rourke for Texas and Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams for Georgia.

Out of these, only Cortez Masto won — the rest were defeated.

After Oprah endorsed Harris in her DNC surprise speech, she received backlash from Trump supporters and a letter she wrote to Trump in 2000 resurfaced.

Addressing the Republican nominee, she had written back then, “Too bad we’re not running for office,” Axios reported. “What a TEAM!”

In a 2023 CBS interview, Oprah clarified, “I might have thought it back then. I might have thought it 23 years ago. I’m not thinking it today.”

In 2015, Trump had also joked about Oprah running as her vice president in an interview with ABC, only to clarify that he was joking.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/20/oprahs-kamala-harris-fundraiser-does-her-support-swing-elections,POSITIVE,0.982430100440979
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Washington, DC –It was Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s “closing argument” to the nation, one final big appeal to voters before the November 5 election day.

And it took place in a highly symbolic venue: the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House in Washington, DC.

Less than four years earlier — on January 6, 2021 — the Ellipse had been the site of a different address from Harris’s Republican rival, then-President Donald Trump. There, he whipped up false fears of election fraud, leading thousands of his supporters toattack the United States Capitolin an effort to prevent the certification of the 2020 election.

That discord, Harris told the sprawling crowds on Tuesday, was the opposite of what she would bring to the White House if elected.

“Tonight, I will speak to everyone about the choice and the stakes in this election,” Vice President Harris said. “We know who Donald Trump is.”

“He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.”

That symbolism was the defining message of the night — and the centrepiece of a speech meant to be an exclamation point at the end of an atypically brief campaign.

“It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American or ruled by chaos or division,” Harris said.

With exactlyseven daysbefore Election Day, it remains unclear whether Harris’s message will be enough to give her the edge over Trump, with whom she is locked in a tight race. Polls have shown the candidates remain neck and neck both nationally and in a handful of keyswing states.

With at least 50 million voters having already cast their ballots, the outcome is largely seen as a toss-up.

But among the crowd at Harris’s rally, her most ardent supporters expressed steadfast — if anxious — optimism.

“We’re one week out, but I always say, ‘All hands on deck’,” said Lauanna Lison, a 60-year-old military retiree who was among the thousands who spilled from the Ellipse onto the gaping lawn in front of the Washington Monument.

“I’m excited, very excited, for Kamala Harris to become the first woman president,” she added. “We’re here to show this has been a campaign of joy, and we are not going back.”

Luci Garza, a 19-year-old student at George Washington University in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera she is “obviously been very anxious and on edge about this election”.

She noted that, in her home state of Texas, a lot rides on the outcome, with immigration and abortion rights among the top election issues.

“This election is so important to me as a woman, as a Latina, as a Texan,” Garza said.

“But coming out here and seeing all of these people dancing and excited, it’s nice to see there are people who do care, and do show up and do want to be human.”

Speaking to the crowd, Harris revisited the policy proposals that have defined her brief campaign, which began in July after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.

She pledged to create an economic policy aimed at the middle class, with a ban on price gouging, efforts to boost the housing market and financial support for new parents.

She also promised to protect the Affordable Care Act, a law that has expanded health insurance for US residents, while expanding Medicare to cover home care.

On abortion rights, she reaffirmed her intention to sign a federal bill protecting access if one were to land on her desk.

Still, throughout her speech, Harris repeatedly returned to the subject of Trump, repeating the stark warnings that have defined the final weeks of her campaign.

“This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power,” Harris said, invoking Trump’s recent reference to political opponents as the “enemy within”.

“The fact that someone disagrees with us does not make them the enemy within,” she said. “They are fellow Americans, and as Americans, we rise above together.”

Fifty-year-old supporter Jason Vaughn, a nurse practitioner from North Carolina, said he hoped Harris’s more unifying message would connect with the voters who remain on the fence in the election.

Vaughn pointed out that Trump recently sparked outrage with a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York on Sunday, during which a comedian compared Puerto Rico with a “floating island of garbage”.

Trump has sincebrushed offthe fallout, telling reporters on Tuesday that the weekend rally was “beautiful” and “an absolute love fest”.

Vaughn, however, said that Tuesday’s Harris rally offered a stark contrast to the Madison Square Garden event.

“The difference between this and the Trump rally? This is about fellowship, people coming together,” said Vaughn, who wore a “White Dudes for Harris” hat.

“I think she’s got the momentum right now.”

He predicted that the Madison Square Garden rally could hurt Trump in the final stretch of the race.

Trump was in the key swing state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, visiting the town of Drexel Hill, where he warned that the country was “being destroyed by incompetent fools”.

“I think the white guys are divided right now,” said Vaughn. “There’s a lot of misogyny, a lot of bravado, and my message is, you don’t have to be that way to be a man.”

But while Harris’s soaring speech in Washington, DC, was meant to be a display of political power, it also testified to her political vulnerabilities.

From the periphery of the event, a pro-Palestine protest could be heard from the street.

Such protests have been relatively common at Harris’s events, and they underscore the continued outrage over the Democrat’s continued support of Israel amid itswar on Gazaand now Lebanon.

Harris has refused to commit to stopping arms shipments to Israel or placing conditions on military aid, if elected. She has, however, said that a ceasefire must be reached.

That position has threatened to erode her support among Arab, Muslim and progressive groups alike, which could be particularly damaging in the swing state of Michigan, which boasts a large Arab American population.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Sumaiya Hamdami, a 62-year-old professor from Maryland, said she has wrestled with voting for Harris, despite being a “lifelong Democrat”.

She said she cast an“uncommitted” ballotduring the primary season to protest the Biden-Harris administration’s stance on the conflict. Biden was still the Democratic candidate at the time.

“Obviously, I have a lot of reservations about voting for this candidate, because she hasn’t had the ability and doesn’t seem inclined to do anything” to cut off weapon shipments to Israel, Hamdami said.

“But I think the alternative is a lot worse, so here I am.”

Others in the crowd indicated that their fears of a second Trump presidency led them to support Harris.

“We’re feeling scared but hopeful,” said Marsha Tripp, a 73-year-old retired occupational therapist from Ohio. “If Trump were to win, it would just be a disaster.”

Harris finished the speech with a pledge that she would be a different president than Biden.

Still, she sought to hammer home a similar theme to Biden’s message during the 2020 race: unity.

“Here’s my promise to you,” Harris said.

“I will always listen to you, even if you didn’t vote for me. I will always tell the truth, even if it’s difficult to hear. I work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/30/not-who-we-are-harris-seeks-finish-line-push-at-crowded-us-capital-rally,POSITIVE,0.9925737380981445
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"In a frequently contentious, sometimes testy exchange, Vice President Kamala Harris went on Fox News and fielded anchor Bret Baier’s questions on immigration, the economy and her policy differences with her Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, as well as her boss, President Joe Biden.

Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, did the interview, her first-ever on Fox, on October 16 as part of her home-stretchelection interview blitz.









Baier asked Harris how many migrants had been released into the country under the Biden-Harris administration, how she would reduce the count and why some of her stances had shifted since her 2019 presidential campaign. He asked Harris whether immigrants illegally in the US should qualify for driver’s licences, free tuition or healthcare, saying her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, had approved laws that did this.

Harris, meanwhile, called Trump unfit to serve, and said many of his former advisers had said the same. She also said his plans would weaken the economy, but hers would strengthen it.

Harris also pointedly said her path would differ from Biden’s. “My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency,” she stated. “And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas.”

We fact-checked several of Harris’s claims and the claims that Baier brought up.

Baier said Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, signed into state law provisions “allowing immigrants in the country illegally to apply for driver’s licences, to qualify for free tuition at universities, to be enrolled in free health care”.

Mostly True.Walz signed a bill in 2023 that lets people in Minnesota, regardless of immigration status, apply for a licence or ID card. To get a licence, people must meet certain requirements. Walz said the bill would make roads safer because it ensured drivers in the state are licensed and carry insurance.

Walz signed another bill that created a scholarship program to cover tuition costs at Minnesota public colleges and universities for students whose household income is less than $80,000 a year. Students who are illegally in the US can apply if they have attended a Minnesota school for at least three years and graduated or received a GED certificate in Minnesota.

Walz also signed legislation that enables immigrants who are in the country illegally to enrol in MinnesotaCare, the state’s publicly-subsidised health insurance program for low-income residents. But unlike what Baier said, MinnesotaCare is not entirely free. People enrolled in MinnesotaCare pay premiums based on household size and income. There are also cost-sharing requirements, such as copayments and deductibles.

Harris told Baier that, “when we had an American military base that was attacked, where American soldiers suffered traumatic brain injuries”, Trump “dismissed them as headaches”.

True.

Harris was referring to a January 8, 2020Iran attack on US soldiers in Iraq. More than 100 soldiers were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, according to thePentagon.

Trump has repeatedly called the injuries “headaches”.

In 2020,Trumpsaid he had “heard that they had headaches” and added it “is not very serious”. Trump repeated this claim in an October 1 news conference in Wisconsin.

After Iran attacked Israel on October 1, Trump responded to a question about whether he should have been stronger on Iran after the 2020 attack that injured US troops. He said: “What does injured mean? You mean because they had a headache because the bombs never hit the fort?”

Harrissaid Trump “is the one who talks about an enemy within, an enemy within, talking about the American people, suggesting he would turn the American military, on the American people”.

True.

In a Fox News interview October 13, Trump said he believes “the enemy from within” would cause chaos on Election Day, suggesting that it is a problem that the National Guard or military might need to handle.

Trump added on to the comments, widely thought to be about Democrats and others who disagree with him, a day later in remarks to a crowd in Pennsylvania. “They are so bad and frankly, they’re evil,” Trump said. “They’re evil. What they’ve done, they’ve weaponized, they’ve weaponized our elections.”

Harris said 16 Nobel laureates indicated that her economic plan “would strengthen our economy, (Trump’s) would make it weaker, would ignite inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year”.

Mostly True.

Harris correctly describes what the Nobel laureates said about inflation during a Trump presidency: “There is rightly a worry that Donald Trump will reignite this inflation.”

But while the group describes Harris’s agenda as “vastly superior” to Trump’s, their letter does not specifically predict a recession by the middle of 2025.

Rather, the group wrote: “We believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the US’s economic standing in the world and a destabilizing effect on the US’s domestic economy.”

The 16 economists are George Akerlof, Angus Deaton, Claudia Goldin, Oliver Hart, Eric S. Maskin, Daniel L. McFadden, Paul R. Milgrom, Roger B. Myerson, Edmund S. Phelps, Paul M. Romer, Alvin E.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s candidate in the United Statespresidential election, has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.

Harris announced Walz’s selection in a text message to supporters on Tuesday and will introduce him at a rally in Philadelphia later in the day.

“Tim is a battle-tested leader who has an incredible track record of getting things done for Minnesota families. I know that he will bring that same principled leadership to our campaign, and to the office of the vice president,” she said in her message.

In a post on X, she said she was “proud” to choose Walz as her running mate.

“As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his. It’s great to have him on the team,” Harris said on X.

In response, Walz said it was the “honour of a lifetime” to be Harris’s VP pick “I’m all in. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school. So, let’s get this done, folks!” he posted on X.







Harris’s choice of a progressive policy champion and a plain speaker from America’s heartland is aimed at helping her win over the rural, white voters in the November 5 polls.

Harris, the first woman and first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, considered a broad field of candidates during a fast vetting process in the race for the White House, after President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid on July 21.

Walz, 60, was elected to a Republican-leaning district in the US House of Representatives in 2006 and served 12 years before being elected the governor of the US state of Minnesota and re-elected to that position in 2022. His nomination would bring to the presidential ticket a record ofdefeating Republicansin a Midwestern state.

A veteran of the US Army National Guard, Walz serves as co-chair of the Democratic National Convention’s rules committee.

As governor, he has pushed a progressive agenda including free school meals, goals for tackling climate change, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for Minnesota workers.

Walz has long advocated for women’s reproductive rights and oversaw state approval of the right to abortion and protected gender-affirming care. But he has also displayed a conservative bent while representing a rural district in the US House, defending agricultural interests and backing gun rights.







Harris, the 59-year-old daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, is adding a popular Midwestern politician whose home state votes reliably for Democrats in presidential elections but is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battleground states.

She will hold a major rally with her vice presidential pick later on Tuesday in Philadelphia in the swing state of Pennsylvania, followed by rallies in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada through Saturday.

The duo will face off against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance in the November election.

Trump’s campaign on Tuesday slammed Walz as a left-wing radical.

“If Walz won’t tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist,” Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s campaign press secretary, said in a statement.

Walz has previously attacked Trump and Vance as “weird”, a catchy insult that has been picked up by the Harris campaign, social media and Democratic activists.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Kamala Harris, the vice president of the United States, has praised her boss, President Joe Biden, a day after hedropped outof the presidential race and endorsed her as his successor.

“Joe Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the last three years is unmatched in modern history,” Harris said on Monday in her first public appearance since the 81-year-old US leader abruptly announced his withdrawal from the November polls a day earlier.

“In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have two terms in office,” Harris said at a White House event to honour college athletes, where she was filling in for Biden, who is recovering at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, after testing positive for COVID-19 last week.







In her statement, however, Harris, 59, did not specifically refer toher new statusas the leading Democratic candidate to replace Biden as the party’s presidential nominee.

Meanwhile, virtually all of the prominent Democrats who had been seen as potential challengers to Harris havelined up behind her, including Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives and one of the longest-serving and best known Democrats.

Pelosi, who remains influential since stepping down as speaker in 2022, played a leading role in persuading Biden to end his campaign amid concerns over his mental acuity and ability to beat Republican Donald Trump or to serve another four years.

“With love and gratitude, I salute President Biden for always believing in the possibilities of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment,” Pelosi, 84, said in a statement on Monday.

“We must unify and charge forward to resoundingly defeat Donald Trump and enthusiastically elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States.”







Biden and Harris have been working together since 2020. As the US president solidified his lead in that year’s election, he promised he would select a woman as his running mate. The selection of Harris was seen as an effort to appeal to Black voters and energise the party’s base.

On Sunday, while declaring he was abandoning his re-election campaign, Biden wrote on X that his endorsement of Harris has been “the best decision” he has made.

Campaign officials and allies have already made hundreds of calls on Harris’s behalf, urging delegates to next month’s Democratic Party convention to join in nominating her for president in the November 5 election against Trump.

The new party nominee will be chosen at the convention in Chicago next month when more than 4,000 party officials and activists will gather to vote.

Harris could, however, still face challengers seeking the Democratic nomination in the coming days.

Rebekah Caruthers, vice president of the Fair Elections Center, told Al Jazeera Harris has a solid record when it comes to winning elections.

“She has been on the ballot many times, with being a district attorney, California attorney general. She herself ran for president during the 2020 cycle,” Caruthers said.

“One thing that the Harris campaign has been putting out: Each time Kamala Harris is on the ballot, she wins her election.”

But some Democrats were concerned about a Harris candidacy, in part because of the weight of a long history of racial and gender discrimination in the US, which has not elected a woman president in its nearly 250-year history.

“We should all prepare for the onslaught of attacks that would face any historic candidate,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters. “Misogyny in our politics is far from over. Racism in our politics – especially confronting Donald Trump as a an opponent – is far, far from over.”

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"With days remaining until Election Day, Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in atight raceto win over undecided voters.

According to the polls, few United Statespresidential electionshave been as tightly contested as this one.









Harris and Trump are in a dead heat and the outcome could be decided by voter turnout in seven key swing states.

As of Thursday,FiveThirtyEight’s daily election poll trackershows that Harris maintains a narrow national lead of about 1.2 points. However, this lead has gradually decreased and falls within the margin of error, indicating that either could potentially be in the lead.



Recent polls from AtlasIntel, released on Thursday, show Trump holding a slight lead of one to two percentage points over his opponent. However, a separate poll from TIPP Insights indicates that the candidates are currently tied.

While most polls indicate Harris is ahead in the national vote, the two candidates are closely matched in swing states.

It’s important to note that while national surveys offer insights into voter sentiment, the Electoral College will ultimately determine the winner, not the nationwide popular vote. Many states tend to strongly favour either Republicans or Democrats.

The seven key swing states are Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), North Carolina (16), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Arizona (11), Wisconsin (10), and Nevada (6), which together hold 93 Electoral College votes.

According to FiveThirtyEight’s daily poll tracker, Harris’s lead in Michigan remains slight, at approximately 0.8 points. However, she has lost her lead in Nevada, where Trump now leads by 0.3 points.

In Wisconsin, her lead has dropped to 0.6 points, down from 0.8 points on Wednesday.



Continuing last week’s trend, if the narrow margins reflected in the poll averages hold on election night, Trump is favoured to win. However, even a small shift away from him in these critical states – or an underestimation of Harris’s support – could result in a victory for the vice president.

Notably, in the 2020 presidential election, Georgia, where Trump is currently leading, shifted from Republican to Democratic after nearly 30 years of voting Republican. Similarly, Arizona, where Trump also has a lead, was won by Democrats by just 0.3 percentage points.

Election polls predict how the population might vote by surveying a sample of voters. Surveys are most commonly conducted by phone or online. In some cases, it is via post or in person.

Poll trackers, which aggregate a number of polls together, are weighted based on a number of factors, such as the sample size of the poll, the pollster quality, how recently the poll was conducted and the particular methodologies employed.

Polls are never 100 percent accurate. Both the 2016 and 2020 US elections saw opinion polls underestimate the popularity of Republican candidates.

Pollsters got it wrong again in the 2022 midterm elections. That time, they undercounted the support for Democrats and predicted a win for Republicans, only to be proven wrong.

Experts note that while pollster services are sophisticated, they have a limited shelf life.

“The problem is that, as the cliche goes, they’re snapshots in time, so as soon as you see them, they’re already out of date. The big question [this year is] with the undecided voters,” Steven Erlanger, the European diplomatic correspondent at The New York Times, told Al Jazeera’sInside Storyprogramme.

Kamala Harris,"DNC day 3: Kamala Harris, Obama, Clinton, Warren to speak","The Democratic Party will make history tonight when it formally nominates Kamala Harris to stand for vice president in the United States national election.

Harris, whose parents were Jamaican and Indian immigrants to the US, will be the first ever woman of colour and the first woman of South Asian descent nominated on a major party ticket – Republican or Democratic.









Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced last week he had selected the California senator to be his vice-presidential running mate in the upcoming campaign.

Here are five things to watch for in tonight’s convention programme:

Harris will be formally nominated by her sister Maya Harris, her niece Meena Harris and stepdaughter Ella Emhoff. She is will likely use her moment in the spotlight to define herbarrier-breaking candidacyas not just a victory for women, or people of colour but as a victory for all Americans as Democrats seek to cast a broad appeal to voters.

She will speak about her affinity for Biden, friendship with his late son Beau, and make the case for Biden’s character and qualifications to be president. At the same time, Harris will seek to demonstrate her own toughness and ability to step into the job from day one, an essential criterion for the vice president.

A former prosecutor who has proven herself a tough interlocutor for Trump administration officials appearing before the Senate, Harris is also expected to devote a portion of her remarks to attacking President Donald Trump’s record.

In addition to Harris, Wednesday’s convention programme features an ensemble of Democratic heavy hitters; former President Barack Obama, primary contender Senator Elizabeth Warren, and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, former Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary Clinton.

While his wife, Michelle, opened the convention Monday night by delivering a grave censure of Trump, Barack Obama will likely focus more on the Democratic nominee and a revival of the message of hope and change that ushered in his own term in office, according to The Associated Press news agency.

Until recently, Obama has carefully observed a norm of American politics as a former president by staying out of current debates and he refrained from endorsing his former vice president during the crowded Democratic presidential primaries earlier this year.

But Obama’s gift for oratory was evident when he made waves with just a few remarks duringhis eulogyfor the late civil rights activist and leader, Representative John Lewis. A ground-breaker in his own right as the first Black president, Obama’s job on Wednesday night will be to fire up the convention audience for Harris’s history-making remarks.

Hillary Rodham Clinton occupies a unique place in Democratic politics as thefirst womanto win the presidential nomination and even though she won the national popular vote in 2016, she lost to Trump where it counts, in the state-by-state tally of the US’s Electoral College.

Her return to the convention stage will serve as an inspiration to women, who only earned the right to vote in the US 100 years ago with the passage of the 19th Amendment, to keep fighting for their place in leadership roles.

Millions of women have taken to the streets to protest against Trump’s presidency and large numbers of women ran for office in 2018 helping Democrats take back control of the US House of Representatives. Six of 22 Democratic presidential candidates including Harris, were women, a record according to a study cited by the AP.

Warren, whoran against Bidenfor the Democratic presidential nomination, has a speaking role in Wednesday’s convention programme and is considered a likely candidate for a top cabinet post in a Biden administration.

Famous for her detailed policy plans – “I have a plan for that” she often said on the campaign trail – Warren will address the US’s economic inequalities that have only been worsened by enormous job losses from the coronavirus pandemic.

Democraticpositions on key issues– gun violence, climate change, immigration and the economy – will be highlighted in Wednesday’s convention programme.

DeAndra Dycus, an Indiana mom whose quadriplegic teen son was paralysed by a stray bullet, will be featured, along with gun safety advocate former Representative Gabrielle Giffords who was wounded in the head by an attacker.

Biden’s plan to tackle climate change, which focuses on creating new jobs in clean energy, will be introduced by New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Barack Obama has endorsed Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee for United States president, which means the vice president has won the backing of all the Democratic Party’s leading figures.

“We called to say Michelle and I couldn’t be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,” former US President Obama told Harris during a phone call, a video of which was posted on social media.

“I can’t have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you,” former first lady Michelle Obama said. “This is going to be historic.”

The Obamas had yet to announce their support for Harris after US PresidentJoe Bidendecided on Sunday to withdraw from the race.

“We told her we think she’ll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support,” Barack Obama posted on X on Friday about the call with Harris earlier in the week.

“At this critical moment for our country, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November.”

Earlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend@KamalaHarris. We told her we think she’ll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support.

Barack Obama made history in 2008 by becoming the first African-American president, and Harris hopes to make history of her own as the first woman and woman of colour elected to lead the country.

Obama remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party even after more than a decade has passed since he was last elected, and he had lent his support to Biden, who was his vice president, during big-money fundraisers.

Harris expressed her gratitude for the Obamas’ endorsement and their long friendship. She has known the Obamas since before his election in 2008

“Thank you both. It means so much. And we’re gonna have some fun with this too, aren’t we?” Harris said.

Harris’s bid against Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump continues to gain steam from supporters, donors and politicians less than a week after Bidenbowed outof the race.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/26/barack-obama-endorses-kamala-harris-for-us-president,NEGATIVE,0.6171234846115112
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"From its first moments, the interview was contentious.

On Wednesday, United States Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview with the conservative-leaning network Fox News, as her campaign attempts to attract voters disenchanted with her Republican rival, Donald Trump.

But host Bret Baier wasted no time zeroing in on the focus of their discussion: immigration.

He confronted her with a Trump campaign advertisement and a video of a bereaved mother, testifying to Congress about the death of her child, allegedly at the hands of two undocumented immigrants.

Harris, however, pointed out that irregular immigration across the US-Mexico border was a concern long before she was elected vice president in 2021 — including under Trump, a former president.

“I think, frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of throwing stones when you’re living in a glass house,” Harris said in response to the Trump ad. “You’ve got to take responsibility for what happened in your administration.”

A poll last week from the Pew Research Center found that voters in the US ranked the economy as their top issue as they head to the polls on November 5.

But rounding out the top five voter issues was immigration, with 41 percent of those surveyed calling it “extremely important” and another 31 percent ranking it “very important”.

Immigration has been a prominent pillar in the platforms of both the Democratic and Republican parties, with both sides pledging to lower irregular border crossings.

But the Pew survey found that Trump appears to have the edge on the subject, with 54 percent of respondents saying he is best able to handle the country’s immigration policies.

That is an advantage that Republicans have sought to press, as the presidential race winds to a close, with less than three weeks to go.

Nevertheless, Trump and Harris have remained virtually tied in overall voter polls nationwide. The poll aggregator, 270toWin, found that Harris has a slight lead, with an average of 49.5 percent to Trump’s 47.3 percent.

As she seeks to pull further ahead, Harris’s campaign has appealed to middle-ground voters, as well as Republicans fed up with Trump’s leadership over the party.

Part of her strategy has been to play up endorsements from prominent Republicans like former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, erstwhile Representative Liz Cheney, a vocal critic of Trump’s on Capitol Hill.

She has also pledged to appoint a Republican to her cabinet if she is elected to the presidency.

Earlier on Wednesday, for instance, that strategy was on full display in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where Harris touted the bipartisan nature of her campaign as an antithesis to what she characterised as Trump’s divisiveness.

“I am joined today by over 100 Republican leaders from across Pennsylvania and across our country who are supporting my candidacy for president of the United States,” she said to cheers from the crowd. “And I am deeply honoured to have their support.”







But her reception was much chillier in the Fox News studio, where Baier tore into her track record on immigration.

His opening question cut right to the thrust of his interview: “How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three and a half years?”

The administration of outgoing President Joe Biden, under whom Harris serves, has been persistently criticised for overseeing a spike in irregular border crossings.

US Customs and Border Protection, for instance, noted a record 2,475,669 “encounters” along the US-Mexico border during the 2023 fiscal year, though its most recent statistics have signalled a significant decline in crossings.

Nevertheless, Biden has taken measures to restrict asylum access to those crossing the border without authorisation.

“Bret, let’s just get to the point,” Harris responded, as she and Baier struggled to speak over one another. “The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired.”

She blamed Trump for scuttling a bipartisan immigration bill in January, which would have marked the first comprehensive reform in that area in decades.

“They want a president of the United States who is not playing political games with the issue but is actually focused on fixing it,” Harris said.

She also played up her track record as the “former attorney general of a border state”, prosecuting “trafficking of drugs, guns and human beings”.

But Baier dogged Harris about the high number of border crossings under the Biden administration — and the crimes he alleged were a consequence.

Studies have consistently found undocumented immigrants commit fewer violent crimes than US-born citizens. But members of the US right, particularly Trump and his running mate JD Vance, have amplified unfounded fears that migrants are a widespread threat to public safety.

Baier also raised a similar argument. “Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed,” Baier said, suggesting immigration policy was to blame. “Do you owe those families an apology?”

“Let me say, first of all, that those were tragic cases. There’s no question about that,” Harris replied. “I can’t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred.”

“It is also true that, if a border security [bill] had been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would have had more border agents at the border.”







Baier also confronted Harris with the criticism that, if elected, her administration would be a continuation of Biden’s.

He noted that last week on the talk show The View, Harris indicated she was in lockstep with the outgoing president. When one panellist on The View asked her if she would have done anything differently than Biden did, Harris responded: “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”

Harris was unequivocal in her response to Baier.

“Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency,” she said. “And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.”

The 59-year-old Harris spent much of her career as a prosecutor, before rising up the ranks to become San Francisco’s district attorney in 2002 and then California’s attorney general in 2011.

Only in 2017 did she arrive in Washington, DC, to serve as a US senator, leaving her term early to become vice president. During Wednesday’s interview, she sought to turn that relatively short experience to her advantage.

“I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington, DC. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make,” she said.

Baier himself faced criticism after the interview. One former Harris aide, Symone Sanders Townsend, denounced his line of questioning on social media afterwards.

“The interviewer wasn’t themselves,” she wrote. “Instead he was rude, misleading and pulled questions straight out of a proverbial Trump/Vance press release.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/17/kamala-harris-spars-with-bret-baier-over-immigration-in-fox-news-interview,NEGATIVE,0.9854195713996887
Kamala Harris,"For a Black feminist, supporting Harris unequivocally is not easy","In 1968, Shirley Chisholm cemented her name in history when she became the first African American congresswoman. I came across her autobiography, Unbought and Unbossed, a few years ago, and it has stayed with me ever since. It not only chronicles her extraordinary life but serves as a radical Black feminist’s global paradigm for navigating politics in a racist, sexist, anti-poor society.

In the book, published just two years after her election to Congress, she writes: “In a just and free society it would be foolish. That I am a national figure because I was the first person in 192 years to be at once a congressman, Black and a woman proves, I think, that our society is not yet either just or free.”









Fast forward to 2020, Chisholm’s words are just as relevant and instructive, especially after another formidable Black woman, Senator Kamala Harris, accepted the Democratic Party’s vice presidential nomination, and becamethefirstBlack woman and first woman of South Asian descent to run for vice president on a major party ticket.

As a Black feminist, upon hearing the news of Harris’s nomination, my knee-jerk reaction was to celebrate another Black woman’s political achievement. Black women have to work twice as hard to prove ourselves as capable enforcers, organisers and leaders. So for a Black woman to ascend to this political height is sensational.

At the surface, the nomination is honourable and a symbolic framework from which we can build our own potential. However, amid global efforts to organise against white supremacy, state-sanctioned violence, and patriarchy, it is important to confront the complicated contradictions in Harris’s public service record head-on. Not doing so would do a disservice to those who are still suffering as a result of the policies she pursued during her career as a “progressive prosecutor”.

Accountability, abolition and abrogation are important tenets of Black feminism in a world where Black bodies are disposable to the justice system. It would be dishonest to celebrate Harris’s nomination as a “Black history” momentwithout reckoning with how she has supported policies that have contributed to a broken criminal justice system that predominantly targets Black men and women.

As California’s attorney general, for example, Harris helped pass a truancy law whichmade it a criminal misdemeanour for parents in California to allow their children to miss more than 10 percent of school days without a valid excuse.As a result of Harris’s efforts to resolve the problem of truancy using the apparatus of law enforcement, many parents, and especially Black, underprivileged mothers, were fined or even jailed.Cheree Peoples of Bueno Park, whose daughter, Shayla, suffers from sickle cell anaemia, was one of these mothers. Despite explaining to the authorities that her daughter’s condition makes it impossible for her to attend school on a regular basis, she was arrested, pep-walked in handcuffs in front of cameras, and prosecuted for two years. Thecharges against her were eventually dropped, but she told Huffington Post in a recent interview that as a result of the ordeal she felt like she “lost” her life and herself.

Feminist scholar Angela Davis acknowledged thatthere are problematic areas associated with Harris’s record as a prosecutorbut asserted:“It’s a feminist approach to be able to work with those contradictions.”

Harris’s “contradictions” may be acceptable and “workable” in the eyes of the older generation just because she is a Black woman who achieved political success in a racist and sexist system. But Black feminists today should not, and cannot afford to, settle for symbolism.

At a time when Black people are killed by police or imprisoned for misdemeanours every day, we cannot afford to sanitise this plight with someone who has dedicated her career to a criminal justice system that prejudicially incarcerates Black people. The Democratic Party’s nomination of a Black woman for vice president cannot be accepted as a powerful incentive to vote blue, as long as that candidate fails to demonstrate her concerted efforts towards change.

With that being said, Harris is still by miles a more credible vice presidential candidate than her white male counterparts. Harris being a Black woman allows us to imagine the possibility of a society where Black bodies can be saved through negotiation and lobbying.

Harris herself will experience intense racism and sexist prejudice on her campaign trail. Black feminism calls on us to shelter her against these attacks on the premise that we value Black women regardless of religion, sexual orientation, social status, politics etc. In honouring our commitment to protect Black women against racist and sexist attacks, however, we should also not shy away from holding Harris to account for her own anti-Black policies and other contributions to a broken system.

Unlike Shirley Chisholm, who unequivocally dedicated her career to teaching and political defiance, Harris’s well-documented career collaboration with the criminal justice system against Black people and people of colour, makes for a “first Black” qualifier that is both unnerving and distracting.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Washington, DC –One advertisement says: “Kamala Harris stands with Israel.”

The other proclaims that the “two-faced” vice president and Democratic candidate “is campaigning for Palestine and trying to get away with it”.

Those contradictory messages have aired in the weeks leading up to a close presidential election in the United States.

And both were produced and paid for by the same group: a shadowy Republican-linked political action committee (PAC) bankrolled by an organisation that has hosted events with Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump.

But the advertisements targeted two separate sets of voters. The first, touting Harris’spro-Israel bona fides, went out in areas of Michigan with a large Arab American presence, according to Google data.

The second, warning of her supposed pro-Palestine bent, targeted towns with large Jewish communities in Pennsylvania.

Experts say the messaging blitz is designed to stoke divisions over Israel’s war in Gaza and Lebanon — and play on ethnic and religious tensions.

Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute think tank, called the advertisements “extraordinary”.

“What we’re looking at here is the targeting of specific communities — Arab Americans in Michigan, Jewish Americans in Pennsylvania — with disinformation that is also, I would suggest, both anti-Semitic and anti-Arab,” Berry told Al Jazeera.

She and other experts warn that the sophistication of the advertisements highlights the power of “dark money” in the election system, as political groups use trickery to zero in on specific communities to discourage them from backing a candidate or voting altogether.







The Israel-focused advertisements are run by a group called FC PAC, which was founded in July as Future Coalition PAC but changed its name earlier this month.

There is little public information about the political action committee other than the names of its treasurer and designated agent, Ray Zaborney and Cabell Hobbs, respectively — two Republican operatives.

But its output has been targeted to sway two pivotal battleground states in the election on November 5.

Running on platforms like YouTube, the Google advertisements that emphasised Harris’s support for Israel were promoted in several zip codes in Michigan, including Dearborn — a Detroit suburb of 100,000 people known as the“capital of Arab America”.

Arab Americans have opposed the US’s continued support for the Israeli offensive, which United Nations experts have describedas a genocide.

Meanwhile, the commercials questioning the vice president’s backing for Israel were promoted in places with a high concentration of Jewish voters, including the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Thousands of Arab Americans in Michigan also received flyers in the mail and text messages from FC PAC.

Some of the advertisements lumped Harris together with Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who represents a Michigan district in the House of Representatives.

“When protestors went after Israel, Harris & Slotkin didn’t back down,” one text message said. “Harris & Slotkin are the pro-Israel team we can trust!”

The advertisements are made to look like they are from a pro-Harris group, if not the candidate’s campaign itself.







Many of the FC PAC advertisements, including the video commercials, stressed the Jewish identity of Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff.

An FC-sponsored leaflet mailed to homes in Dearborn showed Harris and Emhoff embracing, with an Israeli flag in the background.

It said that Harris “leans on her Jewish husband Doug Emhoff to advise on high level pro-Israel policies”.

Advocates warn that the ad campaign tries to tap into stereotypes about the beliefs of Arab and Jewish voters while preying on elevated tensions and anger in both communities amid Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killednearly 43,000 Palestinians.

Berry called the messaging “disturbing” and racist towards both Arab and Jewish Americans.

“It is a flattening of both communities in such a way that they’re suggesting that we are so bigoted that this is what would work,” she told Al Jazeera.

Arab American voters have overwhelmingly backed Jewish candidates in the past, including SenatorBernie Sanderswhen he ran for president in 2016 and 2020.

Still, Berry noted that the advertising campaign’s sophisticated design could mislead voters into thinking the messaging is coming from the Harris campaign.

“I’ve just never seen anything play out like this here,” she said. “When your average person is going to receive a text that reads like a text from the campaign, the reaction is: ‘Why? Why would you talk like this?'”

FC appears to have taken advantage of lax regulations to push election tricks to the next level.

But previous campaigns have used similar methods. For example, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which is partly funded byright-wing donors, spends millions of dollars on Democratic primaries to defeat progressive critics of Israel.

The lobby group’s election arm is called United Democracy Project, and it runs advertisements that have nothing to do with Israel, which helps conceal itsreal agenda.

Another example came in 2022, when Democratic-linked groups ran advertisements to boost far-right candidates in Republican primaries in swing districts, perceiving them to be easier opponents in the general elections.

But Berry said the FC effort is especially dangerous in the way it is targeting Arab and Jewish American voters.

“This is, again, yet another example of our broken campaign finance system that requires deep, deep examination and reform,” she told Al Jazeera.

FC recently took down its website, which featured the commercials it had been running.

According to Federal Election Commission records, FC has received a single donation of $3m from a Republican-linked group called Building America’s Future (BAF), which has co-hostedeventswith Trump’s campaign for re-election.

As a so-called dark money group, BAF does not have to reveal its donors, said Anna Massoglia, the editorial and investigations manager at Open Secrets, a website that tracks spending in US politics.

BAF is officially a social welfare organisation, designated as a 501(c)(4) group under the tax code.

“These are not supposed to be political groups. They exist for social welfare purposes but due to how the rules are structured, they can spend unlimited sums on US elections as long as it’s not their primary purpose,” Massoglia told Al Jazeera.

While dark-money groups cannot explicitly urge people to vote for a certain candidate, they can spend to support or oppose any politician or policy.

In contrast, super PACs dedicated to campaigning are required to reveal the sources of their funding to election authorities. But there is a loophole.

“Super PACs, even though they do have to disclose their donors to the election commission, they can just disclose a dark-money group, which hides the ultimate source of funding in some cases,” Massoglia said.









BAF did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.

“There are a lot of grey areas in federal campaign finance law that have allowed these groups to operate largely unchecked — in particular, with areas like online media and with funnelling money through 501(c)(4)s to super PACs,” Massoglia told Al Jazeera.

“These are much newer tactics that the Federal Election Commission hasn’t reined in yet.”

Massoglia raised concerns about misleading campaigns’ effects on American democracy.

“It’s really important for voters to be informed, to be able to find out who is behind the messaging they are consuming, in particular when you have deceptive messaging,” she said.

Berry echoed that assessment, stressing that it should be up to the voters to make their own decisions about the election without outside manipulation.

But in Michigan and across the country, Arab American voters are already growing furious with the Democrats’ support for Israel.

Harris has pledged tocontinue armingIsrael despite ongoing, well-documented abuses in Lebanon and Gaza.

And Slotkin, the Senate candidate targeted in the FC campaign, is one of the staunchest supporters of Israel among the largely pro-Israel Democrats.







In recent months, Slotkin voted with the Republican majority in the House of Representatives for a bill that would impose sanctions on International Criminal Court officials for investigating Israeli atrocities. She also backed a measure that would ban the US State Department from citing thedeath tollrecorded by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

Berry underscored that Slotkin and Harris have largely ignored the demands and views of voters concerned about the war in Gaza and Lebanon.

“You are looking at a dystopian reality where both the presidential election and even that state race are running in such a way that those individual candidates have been so incredibly tone-deaf to the needs of their constituents that even that horrible ad is tapping into something that’s potentially believable,” she said.

Hussein Dabajeh, a Lebanese American political consultant in the Detroit area, also said some voters believe that the FC flyers and text messages come from the Harris campaign based on the vice president’sown recordon the issue.

Harris has maintained steadfast support for Israel and has pledged to continue arming the US ally.

Dabajeh stressed that the Democrats only have themselves to blame if they lose Michigan after alienating the swing state’s large Arab American community.

“That’s what the ads are doing: They’re highlighting a record that’s actually true,” Dabajeh told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/23/how-republican-linked-ads-stir-israel-tensions-to-undermine-kamala-harris,NEGATIVE,0.9966624975204468

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Over the past month, as Kamala Harris’s campaign for the US presidency has gained momentum, hopes she would take a strong stance on thegenocide in Gazahave dwindled.

Her candidacy has brought disillusionment among supporters of the Palestinian cause, and with it, growing tensions between anti-genocide activists and Harris supporters.









The tension was reflected in abitter exchangeearlier this month between TikTok creators Maya Abdullah and Tori Grier, which fuelled a debate on social media about racism and disparate community interests. Grier’s supporters argue the Black community should vote for Harris to avoid increased violence and discrimination under another Trump administration. On the other hand, Abdullah’s supporters contend Palestinian Americans should not be pressured to vote for someone who has enabled thegenocideof their relatives in Palestine and that allies from other ethnic and religious groups should stand in solidarity with them.

It is unclear to what extent this debate is changing voting attitudes, but if it deepens, it could affect Black-Palestinian anticolonial solidarity at a critical moment in history. This would be a loss for both communities.

The engagement between the Black and Palestinian communities in the United States and beyond has a long history. Its roots lie in the recognition that for Black and brown people, oppression manifests itself in similar ways: as white supremacy, structural racism, Islamophobia and imperialism which subjugate, dispossess and kill.

It is no coincidence that in the US, the Black liberation movement features influential leaders like Malcolm X, Kwame Ture, Huey P Newton, Angela Davis and others who have spoken up about the colonisation and occupation of Palestine. In the 1960s, amid the civil rights struggle, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Black Panther Party repeatedly emphasised the need for anticolonial alliances to confront white supremacy, Zionism, capitalism and imperialism.

The African anticolonial struggles also repeatedly made parallels with the Palestinian struggle. To this day, the Palestinian cause remains close to the heart of the South African and Algerian nations, who led their own struggles against colonial rule.

In 1969, seven years after it liberated itself from French colonial rule, Algeria hosted the inaugural Pan-African Cultural Festival, positioning itself as a leader of revolutionary struggle. Hundreds of delegates attended the event from 31 independent African nations, including representatives from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). The festival was crucial in uniting the struggles of Africa and Palestine into a broader global movement against imperialism.

More recently, over the past decade, the pro-Palestinian movement has supported and directly engaged with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, as it hasrisen against anti-Black violence, particularly following the murder of George Floyd. For a growing number of Black Americans, the parallels between their own oppression and that of Palestinians living under Israeli apartheid and occupation have become apparent.

After Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza, key organisations of the Black community called for a ceasefire. Among them are the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the leading civil rights organisation in the US, the Council of Bishops of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and The Martin Luther King Jr Center. In June, the NAACP issued a bold statement, urging the Biden administration to halt weapons shipments to Israel.

Black students and organisations, alongside Palestinian and Jewish anti-Zionist groups, among others, came together in the student anti-genocide movement, demonstrating their shared commitment in the fight against all forms of racism. They rejectedZionism as a white supremacistEuropean project, like other manifest destiny ideologies underpinning Western settler-colonial ventures, including in the US.

A similar alliance drove theUncommittedMovement, which called for Democrats to vote “uncommitted” in presidential primaries to pressure President Joe Biden into meeting their demands for a ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel.

Over the years, the strength of Black-Palestinian solidarity has been increasingly recognised as a threat by Israel and American Zionists. They view intersectional and anti-colonial solidarity as a threat because it challenges and dismantles divisiveZionist propaganda.

In the past, liberal Zionist media and major Zionist lobbies have launched smear campaigns against BLM, accusing the movement of anti-Semitism. After October 7, there has also been a concerted media effort to convince the Black community that Palestinian liberation is “not their battle”.

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has consistently targeted Black politicians who have challenged Zionist interests, often through coordinated smear campaigns. A notable example is US RepresentativeIlhan Omar, who has faced relentless attacks seeking to unseat her and damage her reputation.

This year, AIPAC successfully unseated Representatives Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush, who have been vocal advocates for Gaza and Palestine, by pouring massive amounts of money into their opponents’ campaigns during the Democratic primaries.

In this context, a rift between the Black and Palestinian communities would play into the hands of Israel and its Zionist supporters.

When debating whether to support Harris or not, it is important here to note who she represents. Though she is a woman of colour,  her politics reflect those of the liberal bourgeois class – referred to by Martin Luther King Jr. as “white moderates” – which undermine progressive and anticolonial agendas under the guise of practicality.

Once in office, she may pay lip service to the antiracism struggle, but would do little to challenge racist structures and institutions. She would likely continue to strengthen the military-industrial complex, promoting economic policies that enrich the wealthy and impoverish the poor, and upholding “tough on crime” practices which disproportionately harm people of colour and poor communities.

Some argue that Harris is the “lesser evil” within the American duopoly, given her emphasis on diverse representation and promises of social reform, yet she may emerge as a more “effective evil” – a term coined by the late journalist Glen Ford to describe President Barack Obama’s ability to push through right-wing policies, while assuaging progressive pushback.

The reluctance to feature a Palestinian voice at the Democratic National Convention, along with Harris’s both-sideism narrative in her acceptance speech, reflect Ford’s framework.

It is important to remember that the forces driving genocidal violence in Gaza are the same ones fueling global oppression. The settler-colonial projects in the US and Israel share core white supremacist ideologies and capitalist-imperial interests, oppressive tactics, aggressive strategies and propaganda techniques.

These powerful networks of colonial and imperial interests, bolstered by the military-industrial complex and surveillance technology, shape US policies including those which enable and dominate Israel-Palestine, from police militarisation to the violent crackdown on immigration and marginalised communities.

For this reason, the genocide in Palestine has far-reaching implications for people of colour and other marginalised groups. Palestine acts as a testing ground for military technologies and the normalisation of extreme violence which can be deployed against oppressed peoples in the Global South and BIPOC in the Global North, who are disproportionately affected by white supremacist, corporate capitalist policies.

A unified Black-Palestinian front is essential to resist these forces and their genocidal aims. Without this solidarity, both communities remain weaker and more isolated in their struggles against their common enemy.

Unity, solidarity and the recognition of a shared struggle against oppression strengthen and drive principled grassroots movements like BLM and Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS).

Dismantling racist capitalist oppression requires an unwavering commitment to revolutionary principles and rejecting alliances with counterrevolutionary forces. True liberation in the US and Palestine can only be achieved through a broad antiracist and anticolonial movement.

The two took the stage in Pennsylvania on Tuesday to Beyonce’s Freedom just hours afterHarris named Walz, the governor of Minnesota, as her vice presidential pick.

Democrats are hopingWalz’s down-to-earth backgroundwill win over voters in crucial swing states in the Midwestern region, including Wisconsin and Michigan.

Introducing the Army National Guard veteran and school-teacher-turned-politician, Harris said Walz was “a leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward, a fighter for the middle class, a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America.”

A former attorney general of California, 59-year-old Harris has sought to contrast her past as a prosecutor with Republican rivalDonald Trump’s criminal record.

She told the crowd of about 10,000 supporters: “This campaign – our campaign – is not just a fight against Donald Trump. Our campaign – this campaign – is a fight for the future.”

Walz, 60, was combative as he went on the attack against 78-year-old Trump.

“He mocks our laws, he sows chaos and division, and that’s to say nothing of his record as president,” Walz said of Trump who was president for four years until 2020. “He froze in the face of the COVID crisis, he drove our economy into the ground, and make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump,” Walz said.

“That’s not even counting the crimes he committed,” he added to roars of laughter and boisterous applause.

He targeted Republicans for pursuing restrictions on women’s reproductive rights, an issue that has plagued the party since the US Supreme Court in 2022ended women’s constitutional right to abortion.

“Even if we wouldn’t make the same choice for ourselves, there’s a golden rule: mind your own damn business!” Walz said, drawing a huge ovation.

The first joint appearance by Harris and Walz offered a glimpse of how they might appeal to voters – one a trailblazing Black and South Asian former senator from California, the other a white ex-congressman from the blue-collar US heartland. The Pennsylvania event was the first stop on a multi-day campaign tour through key states crucial to election success: Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada.

Trump and his running mate Senator JD Vance were quick to tag the new competition as too liberal.

“This is the most Radical Left duo in American history,” Trump wrote on his social media platform.

Analysts said the new Democratic ticket were on the same page on policy and had the experience to govern.

“What you saw today was a ticket that represents both the coastal liberals and the Midwest working class folks who are the base of the Democratic Party and what you also heard was a very effective takedown of the Republican party ticket, which includes a convicted felon and a guy who is the reason why Tim Walz refers to the Republican ticket as ‘weird’,” Luis Navarro, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, told Al Jazeera.

While most voters will make their choice on November 5 based on the presidential candidate, the choice of a  running mate can help or hurt the ticket as a result of their background, home state popularity and ability to sway important constituencies or independent voters.

A relatively low-profile politician, Walz spent 12 years in the US House of Representatives representing a largely rural district in southern Minnesota. He ran for governor of the state for the first time in 2018 and was returned for a second term four years later. Despite the state not being a traditional Democratic stronghold, Walz won both races with ease.

During his time in office, he has won approval for policies including tuition fee programmes for low-income students, free school meals, goals for tackling climate change, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for workers.

Walz, who got the nod ahead of more prominent names including Pennsylvania’s popular Governor Josh Shapiro, on Tuesday spoke of his upbringing in the small town of Butte, Nebraska where he worked on the family farm and where community was a “way of life” with neighbours striving together “for the common good.”

He also lauded Harris’s work and career.

“She took on the predators and the fraudsters, she took down transnational gangs, stood up against powerful corporate interests,” Walz said.

“And she never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people’s lives… And she does it all with a sense of joy.”

The vice president’s first joint appearance with her new running mate comes before the Democratic Party convention in Chicago, which starts on August 19.

The noisy rally was a striking reminder of how different the race was before 81-year-old President Joe Biden bowed to mounting concerns over his age andwithdrew from the racegiving his endorsement to Harris.

Polls show she has erased the lead Trump had built against Biden.

The Harris campaign said it had raised more than $20m after Walz wasannouncedas Harris’s running mate.

Biden described the Harris and Walz ticket as “a powerful voice for working people and America’s great middle class”.

Kamala Harris,Kamala Harris accuses China of ‘intimidation’ in South China Sea,"US Vice President Kamala Harris has accused China of using “coercion” and “intimidation” to back unlawful claims in the South China Sea as she sought to rally Asian countries against Beijing and shore up US credibility in the wake of a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Her comments on Tuesday came during a seven-day trip to Singapore and Vietnam that is aimed at standing up to China’s growing security and economic influence globally.

The US has called rivalry with China “the biggest geopolitical test” of the century and is diverting attention and resources to the Indo-Pacific region as it turns away from old security preoccupations, including with the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan.

“We know that Beijing continues to coerce, to intimidate and to make claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea,” Harris said in her speech in Singapore.







“Beijing’s actions continue to undermine the rules-based order and threaten the sovereignty of nations,” she said.

“The United States stands with our allies and partners in the face of these threats.”

China claims almost all of the resource-rich sea, through which trillions of dollars in shipping trade passes annually, with competing claims from four Southeast Asian states as well as Taiwan.

Beijing has been accused of deploying a range of military hardware, including anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles there, and ignored a 2016 international tribunal decision at The Hague that declared its historical claim over most of the waters to be without basis.

Tensions have escalated in recent months between Beijing and rival claimants.

Manila was angered after hundreds of Chinese boats were spotted inside the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone, while Malaysia scrambled fighter jets to intercept Chinese military aircraft that appeared off its coast.



The US Navy meanwhile regularly conducts “freedom of navigation” operations through the disputed waters, which China objects to, saying they do not help promote peace or stability.

In recent months, US President Joe Biden’s administration has ramped up outreach to the region, with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Austin both visiting the area. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a number of virtual meetings with Southeast Asian officials earlier this month.

Harris said the region was “critically important to our nation’s security and prosperity”, adding that “our partnerships in Singapore, in Southeast Asia and throughout the Indo-Pacific are a top priority for the United States”.

She also sought to allay fears that growing US-China tensions could force countries who have strong ties with both of the world’s top economies to choose sides.

“Our engagement in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific is not against any one country, nor is it designed to make anyone choose between countries,” she said.

Part of Harris’s task during the trip will be convincing leaders in the region that the US commitment to Southeast Asia is firm and not a parallel to Afghanistan.

The chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, however, complicated that message of support to the region, raising questions about the US commitment to its allies. While Biden said last week that an indefinite engagement would have benefitted “true strategic competitors” China and Russia, China has seized on the images of violence from the evacuation to slam the US for its engagement there.







In Tuesday’s speech, Harris defended Biden’s decision to push ahead with the US pullout from Afghanistan as “courageous and right” and reiterated that US officials were “laser-focused” on the evacuation from Kabul airport.

She also said the US had put itself forward to host a meeting of the Asia-Pacific trade group APEC in 2023, which includes the US, China and Japan.

After the speech Tuesday, Harris held a roundtable discussion with business leaders on supply chain issues. And after a delay of several hours that her staff refused to explain, Harris departed for Vietnam, the trip’s second and final stop. She meets with top Vietnamese officials on Wednesday.

The cause of the delay was a reported case of the so-called Havana Syndrome, according to an administration official not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation. The person potentially afflicted was not immediately identified.

The US Embassy in Hanoi issued a statement saying the delay was because Harris’ office learned about a report of a “recent possible anomalous health incident” in the Vietnamese capital. The embassy provided no details, but said Harris’ office decided to travel to Hanoi “after careful assessment.”

The US government uses “anomalous health incident” to describe the syndrome, a rash ofmysterious health incidentsfirst reported by American diplomats and other government employees in Havana, Cuba, beginning in 2016. Some of those impacted report hearing a loud piercing sound and feeling intense pressure in the face. Pain, nausea, and dizziness sometimes followed.

Similar, unexplained health ailments have since been reported by Americans serving in other countries. Administration officials have speculated that Russia may be involved, a suggestion Moscow has denied.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/24/us-vp-harris-accuses-china-of-intimidation-in-south-china-sea,NEGATIVE,0.9798110127449036
Kamala Harris,"Harris stresses US support for Israel, Gaza truce in talks with Gantz","United States Vice President Kamala Harris has reiterated her country’s support for Israel and pushed for more humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip in talks with Israeli war cabinetmember Benny Gantz.

In a readout of Monday’s meeting in Washington, DC, the White House said Harris “expressed her deep concern about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza”, a narrow Palestinian enclave that has been the subject of a deadly Israelimilitary offensivesince October 7.

The statement explained that Harris emphasised the importance of reaching a deal that would see the release of captives taken by the Palestinian group Hamas in exchange for an immediate six-week truce.

“She urged Israel to take additional measures in cooperation with the United States and international partners to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and ensure its safe distribution to those in need,” the statement also said.

Gantz’s visit to Washington, DC comes as US President Joe Biden’s administration faces widespread pressure to curb the US’s “unwavering” support for Israel in light of the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza.

More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s bombardment, which began on October 7 following a Hamas attack on southern Israel, which killed about 1,100 people.







Critics have pointed out that Israel’s war on Gaza has pushed the territory – home to nearly 2.3 million people – to the brink of collapse. The vast majority of the population has been displaced amid the bombing and an Israeli siege has left basic necessities like food, water and medicine in short supply.

Experts havewarned of famine, with Palestinian childrenalready dyingfrommalnutrition.

In recent weeks, the Biden administration has shifted its tone, pushing for more assistance into Gaza. Itrecently airdroppeda limited number of meals to Palestinians there. But critics say those efforts will have scant effect if Washington does not exert pressure on Israel to stop the war.

Some have called for the US to withhold military and diplomatic assistance to the Israeli government. The US government provides at least $3.8bn in military assistance to Israel annually.

Reporting from Washington, DC, on Monday afternoon, Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi said there have been several “performative gestures” from the White House in recent days amid an uptick in public pressure.

On Sunday, for instance, Harris spoke in Selma, Alabama – an important site in the US civil rights movement – where shereaffirmed US supportfor a six-week pause in the fighting and spoke in stark terms about the “inhumane” conditions in Gaza.

But ultimately, Washington’s policies remain “fundamentally the same”, Rattansi said.







Gantz, a former top general in the Israeli army, is widely seen as a more centrist politician than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

But critics say that, as a member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet, he too represents the Israeli government and its policies in Gaza.

Biden, who is seeking re-election in November, has already faced a backlash at the ballot box for his stance towards Israel’s war in Gaza. Last week, more than 101,000Democratic primary votersin the state of Michigan voted “uncommitted” instead of supporting Biden, largely as the result of an organised protest campaign stemming from the Gaza war.

Speaking to Al Jazeera on Monday, Tamer Qarmout, an assistant professor in public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said what matters is whether the Biden administration will take “real action to stop Israel” from continuing its war.

“We don’t see this happening,” Qarmout said. “The US is not really using any of its leverage to change Israel’s behaviour.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/5/harris-stresses-us-support-for-israel-gaza-truce-in-talks-with-gantz,POSITIVE,0.8968735337257385
Kamala Harris,Biden names Harris to lead effort to stem migration at border,"US President Joe Biden has named Vice PresidentKamala Harristo lead his administration’s efforts, along withMexicoand Central America’s Northern Triangle countries, to try to stem the flow of immigration to the United States.

Biden announced the move at a White House meeting with his immigration team on Wednesday.

“I can think of nobody who is better qualified to do this,” Biden said.

“When she speaks, she speaks for me. She doesn’t have to check with me,” he said.

The Biden administration hasfaced mounting criticismover the arrival of large numbers of migrants and asylum seekers at the US border with Mexico in recent weeks.

In particular, increasing numbers ofunaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in jail-like border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters, have drawn concern from immigration advocates.

Al Jazeera’s Manuel Rapalo, reporting from Tijuana, Mexico, on Wednesday, said approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people have been waiting in a makeshift camp just outside El Chaparral border crossing, hoping to be allowed into the US.







The camp was set up about one month ago, Rapalo said, and many of the families fled their homes in Central America and southern Mexico due to threats of violence and recent natural disasters.

Rapalo reported that many people living in the camp said they had not received instructions from Mexican or US authorities about what to do next, fuelling a sense of confusion, and “there is a sense of growing desperation among a lot of the people”.

“They’ve been waiting, some for over a month – they just don’t know what they’re waiting for. Many are hoping that US officials will see this migrant camp … and give them a chance to plead their asylum cases to US authorities,” he said.

“Migrants here [are] really at the mercy of the elements; extreme heat during the day, extreme cold during the night, the persistent rains that have been hitting Tijuana over the last couple of days.”

Biden has facedstiff criticism from Republicans, who have blamed the US president for the increase in arrivals.

“It is a crisis that was created by the Biden administration, by their own policies,” Senator Ted Cruz told reporters at the US Capitol on Wednesday.

Cruz said he would be part of a group of 18Senate Republicansvisiting a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facility on Friday in Texas, where migrant children are being held in overflow detention cells.

Cruz and other Republican senators say that by dismantling former President Donald Trump’s tough border policies, theBiden administrationhas given new incentives to thousands of migrants trying to get into the US.

Biden administration officials, however,have blamed Trumpfor dismantling the US immigration system. The former president pursued hardline, anti-immigration policies that were widely criticised by migration advocates and rights groups.

Harris said on Wednesday that, “There is no question that this is a challenging situation.”

“While we are clear that people should not come to the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law,” she said. “Because we can chew gum and walk at the same time, let’s address the root causes that cause people to make the trek.”







Also on Wednesday, Biden said the US would invest $700m into a development plan for the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as part of an effort to tackle theroot causesof migration.

“The reason why so many people were leaving, we learned was not only gang violence and trafficking and cartel, butnatural disasters, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes,” he said.

Biden said the US is goingto need helpfrom Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries, and that Harris “agreed to lead our diplomatic efforts and work with those countries”.

El Salvador President Nayib Bukele criticised the US focus on Northern Triangle countries in a tweet on Wednesday.

Bukele retweeted a chart with data indicating a significant decrease in the amount of unaccompanied children from El Salvador taken into custody by CBP since 2020, compared with previous years.

“If the United States wants to seriously address immigration at the southern border, they should really drop the ‘Northern Triangle’ concept,” Bukele tweeted. “A recycled plan that did not work in 2014 will not work now.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/24/biden-names-harris-lead-effort-stem-migration-border,NEGATIVE,0.8339980840682983
Kamala Harris,Harris adviser denies support for cutting off weapons transfers to Israel,"Advisers close to Vice President Kamala Harris have denied that she expressed openness to cutting off arms transfers to Israel, a key demand of pro-Palestine groups looking for asharp departurefrom the United States’ policy of support for Israel’s war in Gaza.

In a social media post on Thursday, Harris’s national security adviser Phil Gordon disputed reports that the Democratic presidential candidate was receptive to calls for a weapons embargo.

“@VP has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law,” Gordon said.

The episode is the latest to raise questions over the extent to whichHarriscould break with President Joe Biden over the war in Gaza, with pro-Palestinian activists pushing for changes beyond a greater rhetorical focus on the suffering of Palestinians.







Rumours that Harris would consider an arms embargo emerged after she spoke briefly with activists from the Uncommitted Movement, a pro-Palestine group sharply critical of US policy on Gaza.

In a video posted to social media on Thursday, Layla Elabed, co-founder of the Uncommitted Movement, said that Harris indicated she would be willing to meet with the group to discuss their demand for an end to US arms transfers to Israel.

“I meet with community members [in Michigan] who are losing tens and hundreds of family members in Gaza. I asked [Harris], ‘Will you meet with us to talk about an arms embargo?’” Elabed said. “And Kamala Harris nodded. She agreed, ‘Yes, we will meet.’”

Harris has sought to portray herself as empathetic to the plight of civilians in Gaza, where Israel’s campaign has killed nearly 40,000 people and been accused of abusessuch as tortureby rights groups.

“The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety — sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time — we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies,”Harris saidafter a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent.”

But pro-Palestine activists, some of whom have numerous relatives who have been killed in Gaza, say a change in tone is not the same as ending the robust diplomatic andmilitary supportthat has been central to Israel’s war effort.

“It’s exactly because the current White House policy allows bombs to flow to Netanyahu unconditionally that he has been emboldened to kill tens of thousands of civilians,” the Uncommitted Movement said in a statement responding to Gordon.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"The Democratic Party has begun the process of formally nominating Kamala Harris as its candidate for the United States presidential elections, less than two weeks after the vice president officiallylaunched her campaign.

Democratic National Convention delegates began officially selecting their nominee for president on Thursday morning in what’s known as a virtual roll call.

Harris, who was thrust into the presidential race last month after President JoeBiden dropped his bidfor re-election, is the only candidate being considered in the roll-call vote.

Typically, the roll call is held at the party’snational convention, a large in-person gathering held every four years to select the Democratic presidential nominee.

But this year, Democrats have chosen to use an electronic voting system that is poised to see Harris secure the nomination before the Democratic National Convention later this month in Chicago.

Here’s what you need to know about the process.

The roll call is basically a vote.

Nearly 4,700 delegates are selected to represent states and territories across the US. They typically cast votes at the party convention to choose the presidential nominee based on primary and caucus results.

But this year — as during the last election cycle — the delegates are voting on an online platform set up by the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

On a rolling basis, each delegate is getting a “personalised and watermarked” form to cast their vote, US media outlets have reported.

To win the nomination, Harris needs the support of at least 1,976 delegates. But her ability to clinch the nomination isn’t in doubt, with The Associated Press news agency reporting last month that she hadfar exceeded that threshold.

Since the vice president had no challengers for the nomination, the electronic voting opened on August 1, as perDNC rules.







It will last several days, with the vote set to close at 6pm on the US East Coast (22:00 GMT) on Monday.

The party had planned to hold a virtual roll call even before President Biden dropped out of the race amidconcerns about his age and abilityto serve another term in office.

That’s because the state of Ohio had set an August 7 deadline to get on the presidential ballot there.

That date came well before the in-person party convention, set to start on August 19. Democrats feared Republicans could try to keep Biden out of the running if the nomination process had not been completed by the Ohio deadline.

Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the DNC, said in a statement in May that the virtual roll call would “ensure that Republicans can’t chip away at our democracy through incompetence or partisan tricks and that Ohioans can exercise their right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice”.

While Ohio has since moved its registration deadline back, Democrats expressed concern that Republicans could still challenge a candidate who has not been confirmed before August 7.

That’s why they continued with their plans to use the virtual roll call with Harris as the presumptive nominee.

Former President Donald Trump was officially confirmed as the Republican nominee duringthe party’s in-person conventionin July.

No. The Democratic Party held its first virtual roll call during the last presidential election, in 2020.

That year marked the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and safety restrictions prevented thousands of delegates from convening in the same room, as they had done in the past.

So instead, the delegates broadcast from their home states, some filming outdoors near iconic sites. A representative for Alabama’s delegates, for instance, spoke in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, a symbol of the US civil rights movement.







When Biden was still the party’s presumptive nominee, some Democratic lawmakers in Congress had criticised the early roll call.

They questioned whether it was a tactic to force through Biden’s nomination, despite increasing appeals for him to withdraw from the race.

US media outlets reported in mid-July that some Democrats on Capitol Hill circulated a letter arguing there was “no legal justification” for the virtual proceedings because Ohio had moved the August 7 deadline back.

“We respectfully but emphatically request that you cancel any plans for an accelerated ‘virtual roll call’ and further refrain from any extraordinary procedures that could be perceived as curtailing legitimate debate,” the letter read, as reported by Axios.

But withBiden’s exit from the raceon July 21, Democrats have coalesced around Harris and dropped their objections to the process.

“Remember that the DNC announced an open process,” Congressman Maxwell Frost of Floridawroteon social media on July 22.

“Just because the VP is such a unifying candidate & getting many endorsements, doesn’t mean this process isn’t open. Anyone can run. When she wins our nomination, it won’t be because she was anointed, it’ll be because she earned it.”

Remember that the DNC announced an open process. Just because the VP is such a unifying candidate & getting many endorsements, doesn’t mean this process isn’t open. Anyone can run. When she wins our nomination, it won’t be because she was anointed, it’ll be because she earned it.

— Maxwell Alejandro Frost (@MaxwellFrostFL)July 22, 2024



Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has lambasted the Democratic National Committee for using his state’s ballot deadline “to justify” the early roll call.

In a letter to the DNC chairman, LaRose — Ohio’s chief elections officer — said he had confirmed with the state attorney general “that Ohio law does not require the DNC to conduct a ‘virtual roll call’ prior to [the party’s] scheduled August convention dates”.

“I’m confident that your attorneys are well-aware of this fact, and I suspect your current rhetorical posturing is part of a plan to replace the incumbent president without a contested convention or any kind of democratic process,”he wroteon July 25.

“It’s clever, if not completely antithetical to your party’s relentless finger wagging aboutthreats to democracy, but I ask that you stop using Ohio to justify your course of action.”

He added that, as long as Democrats certify their nominations for president and vice president by September 1, they would appear on Ohio ballots in November.

Harris has been in the presidential race for less than two weeks at this point. She has not yet picked a vice president to run alongside her on the Democratic ticket.

But US media outlets have reported that her running mate could be announced any day now.

Several names haveemerged atop the listof possible vice-presidential nominees, including Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.

Harris can still announce her vice presidential pick after the virtual nomination process is complete, according to the revised DNC rules. That person would then be added to her ticket.







Typically, the conventions are where the roll-call votes take place. So what now?

This month’s Democratic convention will still host votes — including a state-by-state roll call — to recognise the party’s presidential and vice-presidential nominees, but they will be “celebratory and ceremonial”, the DNCsays on its website.

While the nominees can theoretically be contested, most conventions in recent years have served as a platform to unite party members behind their respective candidates.

The Democratic National Convention will take place over four days, from August 19 to 22, in Chicago, Illinois.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/1/democrats-begin-process-to-nominate-harris-for-president-what-to-know,NEGATIVE,0.9608801603317261
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Within a day ofKamala Harrislaunching her presidential bid in the United States, her campaign account on X, KamalaHQ, had gained more than 500,000 followers.

Could her account’s header image, the words “kamala hq” sprawled across a chartreuse backdrop in deliberately low resolution, have something to do with the surge in online support for Harris?

The campaign rebrand mimics the cover art for English singer Charli XCX’s recent album called brat. The rebrand came soon after Charli herself endorsed Vice President Harris in a three-word X post that rattled cyberspace on Monday and that Harris’s campaign quickly appropriated: “kamala IS brat.”

Brat is Charli’s sixth studio album, released on June 7.

In the album, Charli unpacks womanhood, jealousy, generational trauma, confidence and vulnerability in 15 upbeat hyperpop tracks. It offers a laid-back, nostalgic synth-pop experience and features several other successful female artists, such as Italian-American model Julia Fox and New Zealand singerLorde.

The album cover is a bright-green square with “brat” written on it in a simple, low-res font.

In a TikTok interview, Charli described a brat as “that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things some times”.It’s a sentiment that’s resonated with many.

Her album has fared well, hitting the third spot on the Billboard 200 list at one point. One of the tracks, 360, has more than 93 million streams on Spotify. Such is the success of the album that some commentators have called this the “brat summer”, and hundreds of thousands of TikTok videos feature the album’s songs.

The concept behind brat has taken the internet by storm, and several online users have appropriated her album cover’s style, writing often humorous or outrageous messages against a bright green, or brat-green, backdrop.

The post is captioned, “And when we put this to bed the internet will go crazy,” a reference to a song on the album titled Girl, so confusing, which went viral after Charli released a version with Lorde.

Harris’s campaign is also using trending music by other artists. Its TikTok account posted a carousel to Femininominon — a play on the words ‘feminine’ and ‘phenomenon’ — a song by American singer Chappell Roan, 26.

Charli’s audience is young — a demographic Harris desperately needs to tap.

Until President Joe Bidendropped out of the raceon Sunday, many American voters were upset by the prospect of a continued gerontocracy as they decided between Biden, 81, and former President Donald Trump, 78.

A February poll conducted by BBC and the research agency Ipsos found that 59 percent of US voters believed both Biden and Trump were too old for another term as president. An additional 27 percent of respondents felt this way about Biden, but not Trump.

Democrats seemed to be in particular trouble: A CNN poll from April showed Biden trailing Trump by 11 percentage points among voters aged 18 to 34.

It did not help that Biden recently made a series ofpublic gaffesand gave a disastrous debate performance against Trump, in which he appeared tolose his train of thought.

Harris, 59, is widely expected to win the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination and, in a contest against Trump, would be the younger of the two candidates.

Charli rose to fame around 2014 when she collaborated with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea on one of the best-selling singles that year called Fancy. The same year, Charli wrote a song titled Boom Clap for the soundtrack of the film The Fault in Our Stars.

Charli has largely been apolitical on her social media and has not commented on world affairs or politicians. But about two months ago, the singer shared a link to donate to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund on Instagram.

Charli’s endorsement of Harris inspired a series of memes, seemingly in support.

One user posted an edit featuring several video clips of Harris against a remix of the brat track Von dutch.

However, others were upset, expressing disappointment over Charli’s endorsement, citingHarris’s backingof Israel’s war on Gaza among reasons for their discontent.More than 39,000 Palestinianshave been killed in the war.

The first meme to stick to Harris’s presidential bid was the “coconut tree” meme. The coconut tree is a reference to a speech Harris made last year, quoting something her mother said during her childhood.

“She would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us: ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you,'” Harris said.

Soon pictures of coconut trees and coconut and palm tree emojis started making the rounds on the internet.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"As Democraticpresidential nomineeKamala Harris overtakes her Republican opponent Donald Trump in opinion polls – she is nowleadingin five crucial swing states – experts warn she will face “a heavy road” when it comes to passing economic legislation should she become the next president of the United States.

The year 2025 will be one filled with political negotiations as several significant pieces of economic legislation are set to expire, including tax cuts for individuals under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the reinstatement of the nation’s debt limit, which was suspended last year.

But with voters choosing members of both houses of the US Congress – all of the lower House of Representatives and a third of the upper chamber, the Senate – in November as well, Harris’s ability to push through any legislation will depend on how Democrats perform in those elections.

“The House is up for grabs, but if the Senate is Republican – a likely outcome – Harris will have a heavy road in getting any legislation passed,” Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Al Jazeera.

Among those major pieces of legislation are the individual provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are due to expire at the end of next year when they will revert to the levels of a 2016 law.

The 2017 law, which wassigned by Donald Trump, provided dramatic tax breaks to US corporations while families at all income levels saw a drop in income tax from 2018 with the largest benefits going to the rich.

“If Harris wants to extend any of the provisions on the individual side or make them more favourable to lower-income people, she will have to contend with the Senate. That will be a huge horse trade,” Hufbauer explained.

There will also be negotiations on the US government’s debt limit, including the perennial challenges of avoiding a government shutdown, said Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics.

“In the low probability that Democrats fully sweep the elections, we don’t expect Harris’s economic agenda to change. She’s running on a platform of continuity, and she’s going to want to implement all the Build Back Better agenda that didn’t get enacted,” such as the caregiving and family support policies, Yaros told Al Jazeera. “We don’t see much difference between her and [incumbent President Joe] Biden’s policies. She will want to run to finish the job.”

Harris’s economic views and policies are so far largely unknown. While Trump is trying to seize on her statements before the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries when she had positioned herself on the left as she tried to win the ticket to be her party’s nominee, economists have largely dismissed those statements.







Her campaign in “2020 was under different circumstances,” Yaros told Al Jazeera. “Now she’s in a general election, so she has to pivot to the centre. She has to appeal to moderates in swing states who will not be enthused by a 35 percent tax rate, for instance,” Yaros said referring to Harris’s 2020 stance when she suggested hiking the corporate tax rate to 35 percent. Corporate tax is currently 21 percent.

Medicare for All is another policy that the Trump campaign has seized upon to discredit Harris as a viable candidate for the top job but, again, one that economists are not worried about. “I wouldn’t take that seriously,” Yaros said. “She needs to pivot to the centre.”

The one thing that could hurt her chances is inflation. Even though the consumer price index is at 2.9 percent and finally within spitting distance of the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent, compared with historic highs of 9.1 percent in June 2022, actual prices are still substantially higher than before the pandemic.

“Her approval rating has been very co-related with Biden’s on inflation and fell like Biden’s in 2022 during high inflation,” Yaros said. “The Democrats and she will still carry that baggage. But now that people are starting to know her more, she’s now more out and front. If her approval rating is on the rise, voters may not penalise her for what happened under the Biden presidency in terms of inflation.”

Hufbauer added: “Inflation, immigration are just killer issues for Democrats, and I don’t think Harris could escape those.”

Harris’s “advantage is that she doesn’t have much of a record in the economic sphere, so that gives her freedom to manoeuvre and do things”, Hufbauer said. These could include political efforts like bringing down petrol prices by releasing US reserves in the run-up to the elections, capping rent hikes at 5 percent and lambasting everybody’s pet peeve – corporate greed.

Prices have gone up and “young people are really unhappy” because house prices have gone up 30 percent to 40 percent and that’s “way more than wages”, Hufbauer pointed out. He added that while Harris cannot really bring down those prices, she can offer sympathy and be forward-looking by addressing issues such as how to tackle the situation using rent control, help for new families coming into the housing market with tax deductions, “things that look like she’s actually addressing that”, Hufbauer said.

On Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported that Harris would announce 3 million new housing units in a speech on Friday and outline new tax incentives for builders who construct properties for first-time homebuyers.







Trump has proposedimposing a 10 percent across-the-board tariff on all imported goods and levies of 60 percent or higher on Chinese imports, an idea derided by economists. “That would be a shock to the world system,” Hufbauer warned. Biden, for his part, has kept many of Trump’s tariffs in place and added targeted ones.

Businesses typically pass higher tariffs on to their customers, raising prices for consumers. That could also affect businesses’ decisions about how and where to invest.

The one area that could really hurt Harris is an expanded war in the Middle East as that will also stoke inflation and send prices skyrocketing again.

“If the US gets on more of a war footing, that’s her danger point on inflation,” Hufbauer said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/8/16/what-economic-challenges-await-kamala-harris-as-us-president-hopeful,NEGATIVE,0.8543370962142944
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"In the hours following Kamala Harris and Donald Trump’s first, and possibly last, in-person face-off, political commentators and unofficial polls seemed to largely crown her the winner of the night.

A CNN poll revealed that debate watchers declared Harris a winner by a comfortable 63-37 margin. A YouGov poll had Harris winning by 43-28 among registered voters. Even pundits at Fox News, the conservative TV network, agreed she bested Trump.

HarrisrattledTrump, baited him on the size of his rallies, and both she and the moderators pushed back and instantly fact-checked some of his most extravagant claims. While she did not offer much substance on some of the issues most pressing to voters — like immigration — she exuded a level of confidence critics previously said she lacked and left the debate stage beaming as her opponent stewed.

Then, to top the evening off, Taylor Swiftendorsed her.

It may all matter little. Official post-debate polls of undecided voters have not been released yet and will take several days, but it is not clear whether either candidate’s performance will change many minds.

But did Harris actually win, or did Trump just unravel, making her the winner?

Al Jazeera checked in with half a dozen experts on debating, political speech, psychology and communications. Some said she successfully tapped into his weaknesses, while others noted that her strategy aimed at unsettling him, but came at the cost of failing to tell voters more about her own policies. Others questioned the value of political debates at all, decrying a spectacle of little substance and utility to undecided voters.

“She won the debate and not just by default,” Tomeka M Robinson, a professor of rhetoric and public advocacy at Hofstra University, told Al Jazeera.

Still, Robinson added, Trump did himself no favours by failing to stick to the issues.

“Trump needed to talk about his policy ideas more rather than relying on leaning into the same dangerous rhetoric about immigrants and reproductive justice,” she said. “He was correct in pushing VP Harris on the issue about the tariffs and that President Biden did not discontinue these. If he would have stuck to his success in certain policy decisions, the debate could have gone differently.”

Tammy R Vigil, a media professor at Boston University focused on political communication also stressed that while Harris exploited Trump’s weaknesses to her advantage, she failed to offer specifics about her policy plans.

“Harris won the debate because she knew exactly what buttons to push to help Trump express himself in the manner that is most revealing of his character,” Vigil told Al Jazeera. “His content is very rarely fact-based and often relies heavily on urging emotional rather than rational responses from viewers. He did the same last night.”

Giving explicit answers about her policies did not appear to be Harris’s priority.

“Harris has adopted the persona of the prosecutor during this campaign,” David A Frank, a rhetoric professor at the University of Oregon told Al Jazeera. “Her strategy in the debate was to put Trump on trial,” he added.

Some experts contrasted Trump’s demeanour on Tuesday night tohis previous presidential debate this year— which eventually led toPresident Biden’s withdrawal from the raceafter adisastrous performance.

“In the first debate, while Biden was mainly the agent of his own destruction, Trump did help by sitting back, staying calm, and staying largely on-message,” Nick Beauchamp, a political science professor at Northeastern University whose work includes modelling political debates, told Al Jazeera.

“In the Harris-Trump debate, by contrast, Harris’s constant needling, jibes, and minor insults appear to have played a large role in causing Trump to perform poorly, with increasingly angry and incoherent diatribes,” he added. “So in that sense, Harris did actively cause Trump to lose, though more by actively causing Trump to act badly than by actively presenting herself in the best light.”

Harris, by contrast, did little to define herself and her values clearly, foregoing that opportunity in favour of what appeared to be a deliberate effort to unsettle Trump. “She didn’t do much to define herself or her policies in the positive sense,” said Beauchamp.

While fact-checkers found plenty to fault Trump on, some commentators warned against ruling Harris the winner, noting that the former president has long proven to be resilient to blunders andpreposterous claimsthat would be career-ending for most other political candidates.

Fairly evaluating a debate is not easy when one candidate seems to be immune to all expectations of truth-telling while the other is expected to meet conventional criteria, such as delivering clarity on policy, said Steven Fein, a professor of psychology at Williams College who studies political debates.

Fein pointed to a long list ofobvious falsehoods proclaimed by Trump on Tuesday— including about the execution of babies, migrants stealing and eating family pets, and Harris meeting with Vladimir Putin just before the invasion of Ukraine.

“That is not only not disqualifying, but it doesn’t hurt him,” said Fein. “Undecided people say they see no differences between the candidates because Harris didn’t offer specifics about her policies. It is like comparing apples with washing machines, let alone oranges.”

Had the debate been scored like college competitions are, a judge would have looked at claims made and supported by credible evidence by each participant, James M Farrell, who teaches argumentation and rhetorical theory at the University of New Hampshire, told Al Jazeera.

On Tuesday, Farrell added, there were many dubious claims and little credible evidence, as well as too many “ad hominem attacks, grounding fallacies, non sequiturs, question-begging fallacies, and strawman fallacies on the part of both candidates,” he added. “This made the debate an unpleasant experience for any voter seeking a civil discussion of our nation’s problems and potential policy solutions.”

That may ultimately be the problem with presidential debates that have become entertainment events more than informative sessions intended to guide voters’ decisions.

“These performances aren’t really debates at all,” said Farrell. “As a template of rational and civil exchange of divergent political views, this whole spectacle was miserable.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/11/did-harris-win-the-debate-or-did-trump-lose-it,POSITIVE,0.9842594265937805
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have spent months pitching their different visions for the United States.

The presidential candidates, representing the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, diverge on most of the policies advocated to solve the country’s problems while only agreeing on some.

Al Jazeera has taken a closer look at their campaign platforms and promises to compare their positions on the key issues facing the US.

Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States Vice President Kamala Harris has deployed some of the music industry’s star power to rally voters in the final weeks before November’s presidential election.

On Saturday, two of the Democratic nominee’s events were headlined by prominent musicians.

At her first stop, in Detroit, Michigan, thesinger and rapper Lizzowarmed up the crowd with a passionate on-stage endorsement.

“I already voted early and I voted for Harris,” the musician, a Detroit native, told a cheering crowd.

Michigan is one of about seven key swing states in the presidential race, which could tilt either towards the Democrat or her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump.

Later in the day, Harris visited another pivotal battleground: the southern state of Georgia.

There, she had also lined up another hometown hero, the musician Usher, who began his music career in Atlanta, the state’s capital. Usher sang a few bars with the crowd before starting his speech.

“It’s really great to be home. I’m here, home, for my Past Present Future Tour but took a quick break from that to come here, share a few words with you about the significance of this moment,” he said.

“I feel that this is a momentous opportunity for each and every one of us. It’s just 17 days away from a very important election, as we all know, and we have the opportunity to choose a new generation of leadership for our country.”

Harris’s visit to Michigan on Saturday coincided with the first day of in-person early voting in Detroit.

Absentee voting by mail had already begun in the state. Michigan’s online “voting dashboard” indicated that, by Saturday morning, more than 1 million mail-in ballots had been received.

It was one of several strong showings across the country, indicating a possible surge in voter enthusiasm. States like North Carolina and Georgia havenotched recordsfor early-voting turnout this week, according to officials.

The chief operating officer for Georgia’s secretary of state, Gabriel Sterling,postedon social media that turnout continues to be high. Georgia’s first day of early voting was Tuesday.

“Congratulations to the counties and especially our great Georgia voters. Y’all have broken another RECORD. Biggest turnout ever for a General Election Saturday,” Sterling wrote.

While experts caution against extrapolating too much from the numbers, political analysts note that Democrats have traditionally seen a boost from large early turnouts.

Harris sought to build on this year’s momentum during her weekend campaign stops.

“Georgia started early voting, broke historic records. North Carolina started early voting, broke historic records in North Carolina. Now, who is the capital of producing records?” she told supporters in Detroit, with a winking reference to the city’s music industry.

“So we are going to break some records here in Detroit today.”

During her visit to Michigan, Harris also took the opportunity to repeat her call for a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has led a yearlong military campaign, killing more than 42,500 Palestinians.

US support for Israel and its war has eroded support for Democrats among Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan.

The state boasts the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the country, and it also the home of anational protest movementagainst the administration of President Joe Biden over its stance on the war.

Harris, who has also been a recipient of that criticism, voiced hope that the killing ofHamas leader Yahya Sinwarin Gaza might usher in an end to hostilities.

“This creates an opening that I believe we must take full advantage of — to dedicate ourselves to ending this war and bringing the hostages home,” Harris told reporters in Detroit.

She added that Middle East policy has long been a difficult issue for the US.

“It has never been easy,” Harris said. “But that doesn’t mean we give up.”

At her campaign rally in Detroit, Harris addressed supporters in front of “Detroit Votes Early” signs — and she and other speakers used their platform to slap back at Republican criticisms of the city.

Earlier in the month, Trump cast Detroit in an unflattering light, telling the Detroit Economic Club that another Democratic president would render the entire country like the “Motor City”.

“Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president,” Trump said of Harris, calling Detroit “a mess”.

Harris, by contrast, took the stage on Saturday in a T-shirt that read “Detroit vs Everybody”, a slogan that has adorned clothing lines and rap songs.

Lizzo, meanwhile, addressed Trump’s comments more bluntly. “I’m so proud to be from this city,” she told the crowd. “You know, they say if Kamala wins, then the whole country will be like Detroit. Proud like Detroit. Resilient like Detroit.”

“Put some respect on Detroit’s name,” she added.

Analysts in general say that the Democratic Party has been more successful in rallying star power to its cause this election cycle.

Harris not only enjoys the endorsement of figures like Lizzo and Usher, but celebrities like Taylor Swift, Oprah and George Clooney have also announced their support for her since she became the presidential candidate in July.

It is not clear, however, if celebrity support actually makes a difference in a campaign. More than 76 percent of voterspolledrecently by Quinnipiac University said Swift’s endorsement would not affect their ballots.

The same goes for Republicans. Two-thirds of those surveyed said entrepreneur Elon Musk’s recent support for Trump would not affect their vote either.

But Democrats are nevertheless banking on the glitter of its star power.

This upcoming week, for instance, former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama are hitting the campaign trail, with only two weeks to go before the election.

It will be the first time Michelle has done the rally circuit. Barack, meanwhile, made his first campaign-trail appearance in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, earlier this month.

Both Harris and Trump are trying to squeak ahead in the crucial last weeks of campaigning. Polling averages show the two are basically tied in the lead-up to November’s vote.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/kamala-harriss-campaign-flexes-celebrity-support-in-detroit-and-atlanta,POSITIVE,0.9993835687637329
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"Barely a week after President Joe Biden dropped out of the United States presidential race, his deputy Kamala Harris emerged as his replacement atop the Democratic Party ticket.

Just this week, she was confirmed as the official Democratic Party nominee, following a string of key endorsements, including from former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.









Harris, a 59-year-old former California prosecutor, could potentially become the first woman — and the first African American-Indian candidate — to make it to the White House.

But experts wonder whether Harris will be able to reverse a troubling trend for Democrats.

Recent opinion polls suggested that Biden had been losing the support of Black voters before his withdrawal from the race. And their support had proven crucial in his 2020 election victory.

That year, 87 percent of Black voters opted to support Biden. But in May, a Pew Research poll of Black voters found that only 77 percent indicated that they would choose Biden over Republican nominee Donald Trump for president in this year’s elections.

So, can Harris turn thisdownward trendaround before the November election?

From the mid-20th century onwards, support for the Democrats has traditionally been high among Black voters, reaching a peak of 95 percent during Barack Obama’s election in 2008, according to exit polls.

The Great Depression in the 1930s is often cited as a turning point. As poverty rose, many voting demographics started to turn against President Herbert Hoover, a Republican.

His successor, Democrat Franklin D Roosevelt, offered an alternative. Roosevelt first won the presidency in 1932 and served a historic four terms in office.

The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies has compiled data from that time period about Black voting trends. While there is no data for 1932, the centre found that Roosevelt gained 71 percent of the Black vote in 1936.

Black communities strongly supported Roosevelt’s New Deal programmes, which attempted to reduce inequality in the wake of the Great Depression.

The Works Progress Administration (WPA), Public Works Administration (PWA) and other programmes provided jobs for millions of Americans, including African Americans. Employment rates rose, though critics point out that rampant discrimination limited how effective the New Deal programmes were for Black communities.

Furthermore, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was also an advocate for civil rights, helping to cement Black support for Roosevelt.

Still, a sizable segment of the Black population continued to support the Republican Party. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies estimates that, until 1964, one in four identified as Republican.

But the fight for civil rights was heating up in the US, and that too shifted the political dynamics.

Roosevelt’s successor, Democrat Harry Truman, made the decision to integrate the military in 1948, and white segregationists like South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond responded by switching parties, joining the Republicans.

Later Democratic presidents, like John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, would make civil rights a centrepiece of their campaigns, drawing significant Black support in the 1960s. The signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for instance, marks a leap in Black identification with the Democratic Party.

Yes, the Republican Party does identify with the legacy of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican president who saw the US through its civil war.

In 1870, under Lincoln, the US passed the 15th Amendment, granting the right to vote to all male citizens, regardless of race.

But afterwards, the ability to vote was hindered by Jim Crow laws that imposed discriminatory standards on Black people seeking to cast a ballot.

It was Johnson, a Democrat, who enforced voting rights by addressing racial discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In the 1964 presidential election, Johnson received 94 percent of the Black vote due to his strong advocacy of civil rights legislation.

Black voter support for the Democrats fell to 83 percent in the 1992 election, when Democratic Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton beat incumbent Republican George HW Bush for the presidency.

Black support for the Democrats went up to 87 percent in 2020. But some Black voters have been gravitating away from the party with support coming down to just 77 percent, according to the latest polls.

In May’s Pew Research poll, 18 percent of Black registered voters said they were leaning towards a vote for Trump.

That represents a 50 percent increase from the 12 percent of Black votes Trump received in the 2020 election.

Since that poll was published, however, Biden has withdrawn from the race. Still, Harris’s ascension as the Democratic nominee has not been a silver bullet to rally Black votes.

According to a recentsurveyfrom the New York Times and Siena College, conducted from July 22 to July 24, an estimated 19 percent of Black voters said they would support Trump.

Approximately 72 percent, meanwhile, said they supported Harris.

Compare that to an earlier New York Times/Siena College survey on July 2. Among registered Black voters, 73 percent supported Biden, and 15 percent backed Trump.

Polls of voters overall, regardless of race, show a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris.

A steady stream of donations suggests Harris has brought back a bit of enthusiasm to the Democratic Party, especially in the Black voting bloc.

Last month, Win With Black Women, a network of Black women leaders, organised a Zoom call to support Harris. Nearly 44,000 people, mostly women, joined the call, and the group was able to raise more than $1.5m in under three hours.

That same week, more than 53,000 Black men participated in the Win With Black Men virtual conference, showing their support for Harris. The organisers announced that it successfully raised more than $1.3m in four hours.

According to the Harris campaign, the Democratic candidate has brought in $200m during the first week of her presidential campaign, with 66 percent of all donations coming from first-time donors. Harris raised a total of $310m in the month of July.

Representative Jim Clyburn, one of the most prominent Black leaders in the Democratic Party, has endorsed Harris.

Clyburn has played a pivotal role in endorsing presidential candidates in the past. For instance, in 2008 when he was House majority whip, Clyburn backed Obama in his successful campaign for the White House.

Clyburn’s endorsement of Biden before the South Carolina Democratic primary in 2020 is widely credited for revitalising Biden’s campaign, leading to a decisive victory.

Biden ultimately secured the Democratic nomination that year and won the presidency.

At the time, Clyburn cited Biden’s choice of Harris as his running mate as one of the main reasons he endorsed him.

“One of President Biden’s first decisions as the nominee was to select a running mate that he believed possessed the values and vision necessary to continue this country’s pursuit toward a ‘more perfect Union.’ I echo the good judgment he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party’s 2024 nominee for President,” Clyburn said in a statement.

In 2024, after launching her own presidential bid, Harris managed to secure the support of Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr, marking the first time King has made a political endorsement publicly.

The Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of more than 60 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, also endorsed Harris on July 22.

On July 21, Letitia James — the first Black person to preside as New York attorney general — likewiseannouncedthat she would lead “a coalition of every Black AG in the nation” to endorse Harris.

Joining James in her coalition were attorneys general from swing states like Nevada and Minnesota.

According to experts, Harris might inherit some of the criticisms Biden faced, as his current vice president.

A Reuters/Ipsospoll— released on July 25, after Biden withdrew from the race — showed strong disapproval for the outgoing president.

Approximately 57 percent of the registered voters polled said they disapproved of his performance. A majority also showed greater confidence in Trump’s ability to handle the economy: An estimated 43 percent approved of Trump’s economic performance, as opposed to 37 percent support for Biden.

Experts say Harris will have to contend with those criticisms about the economy, particularly after a rise in inflation. Recent reports, however, show that inflation has slowed in recent months.

Immigration has also been a sore spot for the Biden administration, due to record-highborder crossingsin 2023. But data for the five most recent months — from February to June — has shown a gradual decline.

Since Harris announced her candidacy for president in July, Republicans have attacked her record as “border czar” — though she herself was never in charge of border security. That falls instead to figures like Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security.

Some voters have questioned how Harris will respond to calls for reparations, proposed as a way to make amends for the centuries of discrimination and slavery Black people have endured in the US.

In an interview with The Root, a news publication that primarily caters to Black audiences, Harris addressed her stance on reparations.

“I think there has to be some form of reparations and we could discuss what that is, but look, we’re looking at more than 200 years of slavery,” Harris said.

However, in a 2019 interview with TheGrio, Harris stated: “I’m not gonna sit here and say I’m going to do something that’s only going to benefit Black people. No. Because whatever benefits that Black family will benefit that community and society as a whole and the country, right?”

Some critics have also highlighted Harris’s record as district attorney of San Francisco and California’s attorney general. She spent seven years in each role, and some question her commitment to criminal justice reform.

In 2011, for instance, Harris pushed for a controversial anti-truancy law that would allow parents to be charged with a misdemeanour in California is their child was absent from school too often without a valid excuse.

Other critics, like former US Representative Tulsi Gabbard, have slammed Harris for rejecting attempts to allow advanced DNA testing in the case of a Black man on death row. They say such examples chip away at Harris’s claims to have been a “progressive” prosecutor.

However, her supporters have lauded efforts like Back on Track, a 2005 programme to help young people arrested on non-violent drug offences get job training and substance abuse assistance.

In an interview with The Guardian, Insha Rahman, director of Vera Action, an organisation advocating against mass incarceration, offered her assessment of Harris’s criminal justice record.

“The longstanding version of Kamala Harris proudly owned the role of being ‘top cop’ and generally shied away from taking progressive stances on criminal justice reform. She played it safe and down the middle,” Rahman said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/can-kamala-harris-help-democrats-regain-lost-black-votes,POSITIVE,0.9972952008247375
Kamala Harris,US Election 2024,"United States Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, released a letter from her doctor that pronounced her in “excellent health” and fit for high office, in an effort to draw a contrast with her counterpart, Donald Trump.

In a memo released on Saturday, physician Joshua Simmons said Harris’s April exam was “unremarkable”, noting her active lifestyle, “very healthy diet”, seasonal allergies, sporadic hives, and moderate alcohol use.

“In summary, Vice President Harris remains in excellent health. She possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency, to include those as chief executive, head of state and commander in chief,” Simmons wrote.

Harris, 59,is runningagainst Republican Trump, 78, for the White House in November.

Locked in a tight race, Harris’s campaign hopes that contrasting her comparative youth and mental acuity with Trump’s more advanced age and tendency to meander, along with the differences in transparency between the two, will help convince undecided voters that she is more fit for office than he is.









Simmons said Harris’s allergies had been well-managed with over-the-counter and prescription medications.

Her urticaria, or hives, were “sporadic and transient and do not seem to be triggered by any particular exposure nor are they associated with other symptoms” and respond well to antihistamine treatment.

Harris has been on allergen immunotherapy for the last three years, dramatically improving her allergy and urticaria symptoms and negating her need for medication other than occasional nasal spray, he said.

Former President Trump questioned PresidentJoe Biden’s healthwhen the 81-year-old president was seeking re-election. Since Biden was replaced on the ticket with Harris, Trump’s own health has drawn more attention.

According to a Harris aide, the vice president made her medical information public on Saturday in an effort to draw attention to Trump’s refusal to do so.

Trump has released very little health information, including after his ear was grazed by a bullet during an assassination attempt in July.

Last November, Trump marked Biden’s birthday by releasing a letter from his physician that reported the former president was in “excellent” physical and mental health.

The letter posted on Trump’s social media platform contained no details to support its claims – measures like weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any test.

Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.

Al Jazeera is an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government.
