Pagers,How did Hezbollah’s pagers explode in Lebanon?,"Hundreds of pagers belonging to the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah havesimultaneously explodedacross Lebanon.

At the time of publishing,at least ninepeople have been killed and 2,750 wounded, according to security services and the Lebanese health minister.







Pagers are small communication devices used commonly before mobile phones became widespread.

The devices display a short text message for the user, relayed by telephone through a central operator.

Unlike mobile phones, pagers work on radio waves, the operator sending a message by radio frequency – rather than the internet – unique to the recipient’s device.

It is thought that the basic technology used in pagers as well as their reliance upon physical hardware means they are harder to monitor, making them popular with groups such as Hezbollah where both mobility and security are paramount.



Theseries of explosions began at about 15:30 local timeand lasted for around an hour.

Casualty numbers are still being confirmed.

One eight-year-old girl has been confirmed among the dead.

Mohammad Mahdi Ammar, the son of Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar,  has also been reported killed.

Hezbollah confirmed that two of its fighters had been killed.

Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad told Al Jazeera: “About 2,750 people were injured, … more than 200 of them critically” with injuries mostly reported to the face, hands and stomach.

Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also injured in the explosions.

Many people, including Hezbollah, are pointing to Israel.

Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a mostly low-level exchange of fire over the Lebanon-Israel border since October 8, the day after Hamas-led attacks on Israel killed 1,139 people, saw about 240 taken captive and set off Israel’s war on Gaza.

Recently, Israeli politicians and media have increasingly talked of military action against Lebanon to drive Hezbollah back from the border to allow for the return of about 60,000 Israelis evacuated right after the attacks began.

“We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression,” Hezbollah said in a statement, adding that Israel “will certainly receive its just punishment for this sinful aggression”.

Despite a similar condemnation from Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary, Israel itself – in keeping with previous situations – remains tight-lipped.

According to Hamze Attar, a defence analyst based in Luxemburg, “They cannot use the same method in Gaza because Hamas is very cyber-aware compared to Hezbollah.

“They are very capable when it comes to telecommunications,” he said of Hamas, stressing the efforts the group goes to to encrypt communications.

“They don’t use phones or cellphones. They have their own network and internet and communication and don’t need anything above ground,” he said.

We still don’t know.

Some speculation has focused on the radio network that pagers rely on, suggesting that it may have been hacked, causing the system to emit a signal that triggered a response within the already doctored pagers.

“What I think happened [is that] every Hezbollah [member] who was at a specific level was attacked,” data analyst Ralph Baydoun told Al Jazeera.

He also suggested that Israel would not need to know the names of whoever received the corrupted signal but it could gather valuable intelligence after the detonations.

“If they had the satellites on, … they would know the names and locations of all operatives who were attacked … immediately when [they asked] for help. They would disclose [their] locations,” he speculated.

Other analysts, such as former British army officer and chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, suggested that Hezbollah’s pagers may have been tampered with along the supply chain and “wired to explode on command”.

If the pager’s lithium battery was triggered to overheat, this would kick-start a process called thermal runaway.

Essentially,  a chemical chain reaction would occur, leading to an increase in temperature and eventually the battery’s violent explosion.

However, triggering that chain reaction within multiple devices that have never been connected to the internet is far from straightforward.

“You have to have a bug in the pager itself [so that] it will overheat as a result of certain circumstances,” Baydoun said, speculating that those circumstances would most likely be a trigger introduced into the pager through doctored code.

Pagers,The Lebanon pager attack: Israel’s terror playbook strikes again,"On Tuesday, hundreds of handheld pagers used by members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollahsimultaneously exploded across Lebanon, killing at least 12 people, including two children. Nearly 3,000 others were wounded, many of them critically.

No one has claimed responsibility for the operation, but it is not hard to guess who is behind it: Israel, a nation thatspecialises in terrorisingselected Arab civilian populations under the pretence of fighting terror. Since October of last year, this same nation has busied itself carrying outgenocidein the Gaza Strip, where officially more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed but the true death toll is likelymany times higher.









And while the ostensible targets of Tuesday’s attack were pager-wielding Hezbollah members, it was carried out with the full knowledge that the fallout would be indiscriminate and that massive civilian casualties would ensue. But that is the whole point of terrorism, is it not?

Hezbollah, it bears underscoring, owes its entire existence to the terroristic1982 Israeli invasionof Lebanon that slaughtered tens of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians. Israel’storture-happy occupationof southern Lebanon persisted until May 2000, when the Israeli military was ignominiously forced to withdraw its forces by the Hezbollah-led Lebanese resistance.

In 2006, Israel returned to Lebanon in a34-day assaulton the country that decimated Lebanese infrastructure and killed an estimated 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians. After all, a nation that thrives on perpetual war cannot afford to let too much time elapse in between blowing things up.

Of course, Israel perpetually claims to be acting in self-defence – and wantonly detonating pagers across Lebanon has apparently now been added to the “defensive” repertoire. But a glance at history reveals that, as in Palestine, Israeli machinations in Lebanon have traditionally been driven by distinctly predatory motives.

Consider a1955 diary entrycourtesy of Moshe Sharett, Israel’s second prime minister, who outlined then-Israeli Army Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan’s vision of finding a Lebanese army officer, “even just a Major,” who could be made sympathetic to the Israeli cause: “We should either win his heart or buy him with money, to make him agree to declare himself the savior of [Lebanon’s] Maronite population”.

After that, things would quickly fall into place: “Then the Israeli army will enter Lebanon, will occupy the necessary territory, and will create a Christian regime which will ally itself with Israel. The territory from the Litani [River] southward will be totally annexed to Israel and everything will be all right”.

Granted, things did not pan out precisely as Dayan had planned. But, hey, annexation can take time.

This particular diary entry, translated into English, appears in a 1980 book titled Israel’s Sacred Terrorism: A Study Based on Moshe Sharett’s Personal Diary and Other Documents. The manuscript author is Livia Rokach, daughter of former Israeli Interior Minister Israel Rokach.

A 1985 review of the book observed that David Ben Gurion, Israel’s inaugural prime minister who ceded the premiership to Sharett, had “carried out a policy he described as ‘retaliation’, but which Sharett saw as one of regular provocations designed to bring about a new war in which Israel could seize more territory from the Arabs in Gaza, the West Bank, Sinai, Syria and Lebanon”.

Fast forward nearly seven decades from that 1955 diary entry, and provocation – pardon, “retaliation” – is still the name of Israel’s game.

Since the onset of all-out genocide in Gaza in October, almost 600 people have been killed in Lebanon in a sort of side war being waged by Israel, which also undertook to assassinate Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut in July – anattackthat killed three civilians, including two children, and wounded 74 others.

But the mass bloodshed occasioned by exploding pagers takes provocation to a new level. Lebanese hospitals are overwhelmed, and Lebanon’s health ministry is scrambling to collect blood donations for the wounded. Meanwhile the United States is, as ever, standing by to ensure that the situation remains as flammable as possible.

Speaking to the press on Tuesday following the pager attack, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller fielded a question from a journalist regarding “reports that Israel will declare soon that the northern front [with Lebanon] is the main front in this war” and the capacity of the US to keep the conflict from “exploding into a regional war”.

According to Miller’s eloquently coherent response, the US would “continue to push for a diplomatic resolution” while talking to its “partners in the region about the need to do – to avoid any type of steps that would avoid escalation of the conflict”. Ultimately, however, he stressed that “this is a question for parties in the region and what kind of world and what kind – they want to live in and what kind of future that they want to have”.

And yet it’s rather difficult to push for a diplomatic resolution to anything while you are simultaneously funnelingbillions of dollarsand all manner ofweaponryto a regional partner who happens to be perpetrating genocide.

Rest assured that however Hezbollah responds to Israel’s latest provocation, the Israeli military will have yet another bloody “retaliation” on hand. And this, to be frank, is not the kind of world anyone should want to live in.

Pagers,"Exploding pagers, psychological warfare: Israel’s attack on Hezbollah","Beirut, Lebanon– At least nine people were killed and some 3,000 injured, including the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, whenthousands of pagers exploded– nearly simultaneously – in Lebanon.

The attack on Tuesday, which purportedly targeted members of the Hezbollah group, caused havoc in civilian areas and overwhelmed hospitals.

A resident of the Burj al-Barajneh refugee camp told Al Jazeera traffic was heavy as bloodied people arrived at the nearby Al Rassoul al-Azam Hospital.

Lebanese hospitals called on all available medics to report for duty as injured people poured through their doors in need of treatment, many covered in blood and in visible pain.

Iranian media said Iran’s Ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani was injured by an exploding pager.

Iran’s mission in Beirut later posted on X, formerly Twitter, saying Amani’s treatment was “progressing well”, adding the reports of his “physical condition and vision are false”.

Attacks were also reported in neighbouring Syria.

Videos circulated online of men out and about – buying fruit or checking out at the grocery store – when a small explosion sends them tumbling to the ground and bystanders running from the detonation.

Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said more than 200 people are in critical condition in some 150 hospitals. Most injuries were in the face, hands and stomach.

People across the country described scenes of horror as the sound of explosions and screams of pain rang out in the streets.

Among the dead was Fatima Abdallah Jaafar, a 10-year-old from Saraaine in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, who died when her father’s pager exploded.

Hezbollah blamed Israel and declared to exact a “fair punishment” on their enemies.

The Lebanese government also held Israel responsible for the attack.

However, Israel refrained from making any remarks. Israeli media reports said the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered ministers not to give interviews at this time.

Earlier on Tuesday, Israel announced theexpansion of its war goalsto include northern residents returning to their homes.

This extends the war goals from Gaza to across the Lebanese border, while Israeli rhetoric over an expanded war – including a possible ground invasion – intensifies.

Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the time to avoid a military confrontation in Lebanon was running out and that the “only way left to ensure the return of Israel’s northern communities” would be through military action.







Hezbollah officials have said since October last year that they would consider the fight over if a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.

The United States has denied any information about the attack beforehand.

US officialssaid they had no prior knowledgeand were still gathering facts. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US wants a “diplomatic resolution” to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

The scale of the attack shocked many as speculation over how Hezbollah’s communication network was penetrated was rife and conspiracy theories began to spread.

One, which spread rapidly on WhatsApp, had a woman’s voice claiming the attack was known about in advance by the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC).

The basis for this seems to be that AUBMC switched to a new system on August 29.

However, AUBMC announced in response to the rumours, that the upgrade to its paging system was implemented as far back as April, and what happened in August was simply an activation.







A post shared by American University of Beirut Medical Center (@aubmc_official)



Hezbollah recently received a shipment of pagers after secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah insisted that members stop using mobile phones to avoid being hacked or targeted by Israeli aerial attacks.

Photos of the pagers show they were AR-924s from the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo. The company quickly announced that it had authorised a Hungarian company called BAC to use the Gold Apollo trademark for certain regions.

The AR-924, its statement said, “is produced and sold by BAC. We only provide brand trademark authorisation.”

The aftermath posed a second risk for Hezbollah, according to Ralph Baydoun, a data analyst at Beirut-based Influeanswers, who said after the attack, “[the Israelis] would know the names and locations of all operatives who were attacked”.

“In addition, they could easily monitor traffic in and out of hospitals through their eyes and ears from the skies or through the hacking of surveillance cameras on roads or in hospitals or the systems within hospitals.”

Defence analyst Hamze Attar said this was Israel telling Hezbollah: “We can harm you more than this.”

Former British Army officer and bomb disposal specialist Chris Hunter agreed.

“They’re sending a message to every single enemy of Israel around the world that: ‘It could be you next,’” he said.







“They’re also sending a message to say: ‘We can target anything, we can target your communications network, we can target something that’s on your body, we can even target something you’re likely to carry in your trousers, pants, pocket, and that’s going to stop you from ever having children again.’

“Those sorts of messages are very, very potent.”

Officials have not confirmed how the explosions happened.

In the immediate aftermath, some analysts speculated that the pagers were hacked, forcing the lithium batteries to overheat and explode.

But as more videos of the explosions emerged, and more details about the casualties, several analysts pointed to supply chain tampering or manipulation of the hardware before it reached Hezbollah’s hands.

Several analysts agreed that explosives could have been planted in the batteries and then triggered by a coordinated message or code.

Hunter, the bomb disposal specialist, said the blast and injuries were inconsistent with lithium battery explosions and that it was unlikely so many batteries could have exploded at once.

“First of all, you just can’t get that many lithium batteries to explode at once just by sending some sort of impetus to a pager,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Secondly, the blast isn’t consistent. Lithium batteries go ‘bang’ and they burn, but they don’t cause high explosive blast injuries.

“The blast injuries that I’ve seen are all consistent with about 1 to 2 ounces – 50 to 60gm – of military-grade high explosive, which you could fit into a pager.”

Hunter, who also worked as an expert witness on the Rafic Hariri assassination trial at The Hague, said all the Hezbollah phones he analysed as part of that case came from one or two suppliers at most.

“They tried to keep it tight and Israel knows this,” he said, suggesting that Israeli operatives likely got access to the pagers at the source, at the production facility, and somehow, through “coercion” or “manipulation” got the supplier – knowingly or not – to supply the pagers.

“Then at a time and place of your choosing, you could send a single message and that would cause every single one of those pagers to detonate,” he said.

“It sounds like it’s the stuff of conspiracy theories, but we know that Israel conducts very imaginative attacks.”

Other experts agreed the devices had been likely compromised with explosives.

“Everything could be tampered with,” Attar said.

“Think as if you are an intelligence officer, if you are planning something that complicated to go off in one day, you’re going to work on all the elements … you need to work on the pager’s case itself and on explosives [in the battery], and the microprocessor and the safety trigger. It’s multilayered.”







Attar said regardless of what was tampered with, it would have to be done in a way that still passed Hezbollah’s inspections.

While Hezbollah promised a response, analysts said Tuesday’s attack showed a strong disparity in technological capabilities between the two sides.

“Whenever you want to go into war with someone else who has such advances in technology and capabilities in tampering and hacking into supply chains and stuff like that, that’s where you have disequilibrium,” Hadi El Khoury, a Paris-based cybersecurity expert, told Al Jazeera.

“If you don’t have your own supply chain then the device in your pocket is not hacker-proof.”

As for Iran or their allies in the “axis of resistance”, “when they use Siemens or Microsoft Windows or any technology that comes from the West, this means that somehow, somewhere, you will have a weak element in your chain”, El Khoury said.

Analysts said the attack’s level of sophistication will force Hezbollah to rethink its communication strategy and much more.

Hezbollah has to “think about supply chains for walkie-talkies they imported and the UAVs drones”, Attar said.

“In all of this, there is a supply chain and now they have to think about what has been compromised in that supply chain.”

Pagers,How did Hezbollah get the pagers that exploded in Lebanon?,"Hundreds of pagers belonging to the armed groupHezbollahexplodedon Tuesday in Lebanon, killing at least12 peopleand wounding about 2,750. Some pagers belonging to Hezbollah also exploded in Syria, leading to some injuries.

Lebanon, Hezbollah and the group’s allies have all blamed Israel. But what really happened? Many analysts believe the answer might lie in how Hezbollah got the pagers in the first place — because that might hold clues to whether the devices were tampered with to facilitate the explosions.

Here’s what we know and what experts believe might have happened:

About 3:30pm (12:30 GMT), hundreds of pagers all over Lebanon started exploding.

Hezbollah released a statement on Tuesday saying two of its fighters and a girl were killed as “pagers belonging to employees of various Hezbollah units and institutions exploded”.

The Iran-backed group attributed thepager blasts to Israel, which has been involved in tit-for-tat attacks with Hezbollah across the Lebanon-Israel border since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza.



Israel’s military has refused to comment on the explosions. Hezbollah has promised retaliation against Israel.

A Lebanese security source and another source told the Reuters news agency that the Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, planted explosives in 5,000 pagers that Hezbollah had ordered months before the explosions. The sources said a code was simultaneously sent to 3,000 of the pagers, triggering the explosions.

While the exact mechanism used for thepagerexplosionsis unclear at the moment, some experts speculate that the radio system that the pagers rely on was hacked, possibly through a doctored code. The batteries of the pagers could have been triggered to overheat, leading to a process called thermal runaway, which in turn caused the pager batteries to explode.

Some analysts, including Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army officer and chemical weapons expert, have speculated that the pagers may also have been tampered with along the supply chain and wired to explode on command.

But Brussels-based military and political analyst Elijah Magnier told Al Jazeera his sources close to the ground in Lebanon had shared details from initial investigations carried out by Hezbollah on pagers that did not explode.

Those investigations suggest that Israel placed 1 to 3 grammes (0.04 to 0.11oz) of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), a powerful explosive, in each device.

Lebanon faces a range of sanctions from the United States, European Union and their Western partners. In addition, the US, United Kingdom and their allies, such as Japan, list Hezbollah among “terrorist” organisations.

That means that companies both registered in these domains or trading with these countries are wary of direct transactions, especially in technology, with Hezbollah — and often with Lebanon at all.

In this case, Magnier said, the pagers procured by Hezbollah were with a third party and they sat at a port for three months, awaiting clearances, before they were finally moved to the Lebanese group.

Hezbollah suspects that it was during those three months that Israel managed to plant explosives in the devices, the military analyst said.

The rechargeable pagers were confiscated and held for some time before being released and shipped to#Lebanon. There,#Israeltempered the pagers and placed the 1-3 gram explosive device in each pager.

— Elijah J. Magnier 🇪🇺 (@ejmalrai)September 17, 2024



He added that Hezbollah’s investigation so far shows that metal balls were placed around the pager batteries, allowing the explosive force to propel metal fragments outward, “significantly increasing the lethality of the blast”. He added that this was also done during the three months when the shipment was on hold.

But where were the pagers made — and when?

The trademark of Taiwan pager manufacturerGold Apollohas been identified on the remains of the exploded pagers, which appear to belong to the company’s AR-924 model.

On Wednesday, the company released a statement denying that it had manufactured Hezbollah’s pagers and saying it was only its logo that was on the devices.

Instead, the pagers had been built by a Hungarian company called BAC through a licensing deal, the Taiwan firm said.

“The design and manufacturing of the products are entirely handled by BAC,” Gold Apollo said in a statement. “We only provide brand trademark authorisation and have no involvement in the design manufacturing of this product.” BAC has not commented so far.

The evidence so far suggests that Hezbollah acquired the pagers around February when the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, ordered members to stop using cellphones because they could be easily intercepted and monitored by Israeli intelligence.



BAC Consulting is based in Hungary’s capital, Budapest.

Reuters reported that the stated address for BAC is a peach-coloured building in a residential area. While the company’s name is posted there on an A4 sheet of paper, an anonymous source present at the building told the news agency the company does not have a physical presence at the building despite being registered there.

According to LinkedIn, BAC’s CEO is Cristiana Barsony-Arcidiacono, whose profile says she has worked for various organisations, including UNESCO.

Her profile says: “We offer in-depth consulting guiding our client’s journey toward innovation, sustainability, and equity while ensuring connection, and authenticity. Our main services are business development, management consultancy, strategy and partnership planning.”

Pagers,"Nine killed, 2,750 wounded across Lebanon as Hezbollah pagers explode","At least nine people were killed and about 2,750 were wounded byexploding handheld pagersacross Lebanon, the country’s health minister has said.

Firass Abiad said that an eight-year-old girl was among those killed and that more than 200 people are in critical condition after the communication devices exploded on Tuesday, with injuries mostly reported to the face, hands and stomach.

Lebanon’s Hezbollah blamed Israel for the spree of pager blasts, saying it will get “its fair punishment”, according to a statement released by the Iran-backed group which has been exchangingalmost daily cross-border fire with Israelfor almost a year.

There was no comment on the blasts from the Israeli military.

Hezbollah said in an earlier statement on Tuesday that two of its fighters and a girl were killed as “pagers belonging to employees of various Hezbollah units and institutions exploded”.

A Hezbollah official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said theexplosion of the pagerswas the “biggest security breach” the group has experienced since October 7, when Israel’s war on Gaza began following the Hamas-led attacks on Israel.

Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was among those injured by the pager explosions on Tuesday, Iran’s Mehr news agency reported.

US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a regular news briefing the United States was not involved in the incidents and did not know who was responsible.

“We are gathering information on this incident,” Miller said. “I can tell you that the US was not involved in it. The US was not aware of this incident in advance.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut, said it appears the devices were detonated in a coordinated attack, which represented a “major development” in the hostilities between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group.

“This is a major security breach. Hezbollah’s communication devices have been compromised. We have seen pictures from across Lebanon of men lying on the floor wounded, bleeding. We have seen reports of hospitals asking for blood,” she said.

She said “near-simultaneous explosions” were reported in southern Lebanon, in the east of the country and in Beirut’s southern suburbs, where there was widespread panic.



Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had called on his fighters a few months ago to stop using smartphones because Israel has the technology to infiltrate those devices, Khodr said.

“So now they’ve resorted to this different communications system using pagers, and it seems they have been penetrated,” she said.







Elijah Magnier, an independent military and political analyst, said Hezbollah relies heavily on pagers to prevent Israel from intercepting its communications, and he speculated that the pagers would have had to have been tampered with before being distributed to Hezbollah members.

“This is not a new system. It has been used in the past … so in this case, there has been involvement of a third party … to allow access …to remotely activate the explosions,” he told Al Jazeera.

“These explosions … are powerful enough to [severely] hit the psychology of Hezbollah.”

Earlier on Tuesday, Israel announced theexpansion of its official war aimsto include enabling Israelis who have fled areas near the Lebanese border to return to their homes, widening its nearly yearlong fight against Hamas in Gaza to focus on Hezbollah.

The exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon have forced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border to flee their homes.

“The political-security cabinet updated the goals of the war this evening, so that they include the following section: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement early on Tuesday.

The exchanges of fire between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah have killed hundreds of people, mostly fighters, in Lebanon and dozens of civilians and soldiers on the Israeli side.

On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said “military action” was the “only way left to ensure the return of Israel’s northern communities”.

Hezbollah claimed a dozen attacks on Israeli positions on Monday and three more on Tuesday.

Pagers,Do Lebanon explosions violate the laws of war?,"Washington, DC –The explosions of wirelesscommunication devicesacross Lebanon this week in a series of attacks widely believed to have been carried out by Israel likely constitute a breach of the laws of war, experts say.

That includes the possible violation of prohibitions on indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, as the blasts have killed dozens of people and injured thousands more.

“You’re not supposed to booby-trap objects that civilians are likely to pick up and use, or objects generally associated with normal civilian use,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, a lawyer and director of the US-based rights group DAWN.

“And this is exactly why we’ve seen the devastation that we’re seeing in Lebanon,” she told Al Jazeera. “Anybody could pick up one ofthese pagers. We also have no idea who had the pagers, or whether or not they’re legitimate military targets.”

Pagers, walkie-talkies, cellphones and other devices that were apparently associated with members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah exploded in two waves of attacks across Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Hezbollah immediately blamed Israel for the attacks, but the Israeli military has yet to comment.

While many details of the blasts remain unclear, they caused devastation across Lebanon: At least 32 people have been killed, including two children and one medic, and more than 3,000 others have been injured.

The series ofsimultaneous explosionsalso prompted scenes of panic in the country of more than five million people, with medical centres facing a flood of wounded patients and residents running out into the streets, terrified and confused.







While Israel has not confirmed its involvement in the attacks this week, it typically argues that its military operations are justified as part of a fight against “terrorism”.

Israel’s supporters have celebrated the explosions in Lebanon, describing them as “precise”, but the blasts went off around civilians – at funerals and in residential buildings, grocery stores, and barber shops, among other places.

International humanitarian law (IHL) – a set of rules spelled out in global treaties meant to protect non-combatants during armed conflict – prohibits attacks that “are not directed at a specific military objective”.

Whitson said the high casualties of the attacks demonstrate that booby-trapped devices are “inherently indiscriminate”.

“They’re incapable of being directed at a specific military target, and it’s very obvious from what we’ve seen and what was completely predictable that it would injure military targets and civilians without distinction,” she told Al Jazeera.

Whitson added that the explosions were a “deliberate decision on the part of Israel” to create chaos in Lebanon. “This is exactly why booby traps of ordinary civilian objects are illegal – because not only do they cause physical harm and injury, they cause psychological and emotional harm.”

Huwaida Arraf, a US-based human rights lawyer, echoed Whitson’s remarks, saying that the explosions violated the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks as well as a ban on booby-trapping devices associated with civilian use.

That latter curb is laid out in the 1996 Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps, and Other Devices – a UN treaty.

— UNICEF Lebanon (@UNICEFLebanon)September 18, 2024



“It is prohibited to use booby-traps or other devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material,” the protocol states.

According to Arraf, the only way the attacks could be considered lawful is if steps were taken to protect civilians and ensure that the blasts only hit legitimate military targets.

But the devices explodedacross Lebanonwith no prior warning.

“There are Israel apologists arguing that this was not an indiscriminate attack but rather very targeted,” Arraf told Al Jazeera.

“As we are learning, these bombs went off in supermarkets and other public spaces. If the target was Lebanese civilians at large, then sure. But this is no less unlawful and, in fact, meets the textbook definition of state terrorism.”

While Hezbollah has a military wing that has been engaged in cross-border clashes with Israel since the outbreak of thewar in Gazain October of last year, it is also a political group with affiliated organisations that provide social services.

Some of the blasts struck membersof Hezbollahwho are not combatants, according to Lebanese media accounts. For example, Tuesday’s attack killed a medic who worked at Al Rassoul Al Azam Hospital, which is linked to Hezbollah-associated charities.

Arraf said civil servants are to be treated as civilians under IHL unless they are known to partake in military operations. “Would anyone suggest that all Israelis who are affiliated with one of the parties in Israel’s government are legitimate targets?”







On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch said that the restrictions on booby traps were designed to avert the kind of devastation Lebanon is experiencing from this week’s explosions.

“The use of an explosive device whose exact location could not be reliably known would be unlawfully indiscriminate, using a means of attack that could not be directed at a specific military target and as a result would strike military targets and civilians without distinction,” Lama Fakih, the group’s Middle East director, said in a statement.

Fakih also called for an urgent, impartial investigation into the incidents.

Craig Martin, a professor at Washburn University School of Law in the US, was less definitive in his assessment of the attacks.

But he said that they potentially violated some provisions of IHL, including the principle of proportionality and the precaution to avoid harming civilians.

Proportionality is the concept that any harm to civilians by a military action must not be excessive in relation to the “concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”.

“If you don’t know where each of these explosives are, and who – in fact – is going to be injured, it’s hard to see how a very granular assessment of proportionality could have been undertaken, either collectively or in relation to each of these individual attacks,” Martin told Al Jazeera.







He added that it is unclear what the strategic objective of the attack is.

Hezbollah continuedits attackson military bases in northern Israel on Wednesday and the blasts did not appear to have a major effect on its ability to operate.

Beyond direct injuries and the terror that civilians across Lebanon experienced, Martin said the blasts’ “foreseeable” effects on Lebanon’s health system should also figure into discussions about their possible disproportionality.

“The other harm – that absolutely is a concrete harm – that should be factored into the principle of proportionality analysis is the extent to which the attacks paralysed the emergency medical infrastructure of Beirut and elsewhere in Lebanon,” he said.

“I’m guessing that further research will show that people who were not even injured in the attack suffered as a result of what was going on in the hospitals.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/do-lebanon-explosions-violate-the-laws-of-war,NEGATIVE,0.9974263310432434
Pagers,"Components for pagers used in Lebanon blasts not from Taiwan, minister says","Components used in thousands of pagers that detonated on Tuesday in Lebanon in a deadly blow to Hezbollah were not made in Taiwan, Taiwan’s economy minister has said.

Taiwan-based Gold Apollo said this week it did not manufacture the devices used in the attack, and that Budapest-based company BAC to which the pagers were traced has a licence to use its brand.

It was not clear how or when the pagers were weaponised so they could be remotely detonated. The same applies to the hundreds of hand-held radios used by Hezbollah that exploded on Wednesday in a second wave of attacks. The two incidents killed 37 people and wounded about 3,000 in Lebanon.

“The components are (mainly) low-end IC (integrated circuits) and batteries,” Taiwan’s Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei told reporters on Friday.

When he was pressed on whether the parts in the pagers that exploded were made in Taiwan, he said, “I can say with certainty they were not made in Taiwan,” adding the case is being investigated by judicial authorities.

Security sources said Israel was responsible for the pager explosions on Tuesday that raised the stakes in a growing conflict between the two sides. Israel has not directly commented on the attacks.

Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung, also speaking to reporters at parliament, answered “no” when asked if he had met with the de facto Israeli ambassador to express concern about the case.

“We are asking our missions abroad to raise their security awareness and will exchange relevant information with other countries,” Lin said.

As Taiwanese authorities look into any potential link between its sprawling global tech supply chains and the devices used in the attacks in Lebanon, Gold Apollo’s president and founder, Hsu Ching-kuang, was questioned by prosecutors late into the night on Thursday, then released.

Another person also at the prosecutor’s office was Teresa Wu, the sole employee of a company called Apollo System, who did not speak to reporters as she left late on Thursday.

Hsu said this week a person called Teresa had been one of his contacts for the deal with BAC.

A spokesperson for the Shilin District Prosecutors Office in Taipei told the Reuters news agency that it had questioned two people as witnesses and was given consent to conduct searches of their firms’ four locations in Taiwan as part of its investigation.

“We’ll seek to determine if there was any possible involvement of these Taiwanese companies as soon as possible, to ensure the safety of the country and its people,” the spokesperson said.

Iran-aligned Hezbollah has pledged to retaliate against Israel, which has not claimed responsibility for the detonations.

Pagers,Hezbollah pagers explode: Has Israel carried out such attacks before?,"Israel and its spy agency Mossad are accused of orchestratingthe explosion of thousands of pagers that killed and maimedcivilians and Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon on Tuesday.

They are also suspected of being behind a series of explosions of other devices in various Lebanese areas on Wednesday.

The exploding radio communication devices, to which Hezbollah switched to avoid mobile phone hacking, killed nine people including an eight-year-old girl, and injured close to 3,000, including Iranian ambassador to Lebanon Mojtaba Amani.

Mossad and the Israeli army cooperated to plant explosives in the devices, according to Israeli and Western media outlets. Israeli authorities remain silent, news circulating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed everyone not to speak.

The explosions exposed many Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon and, as they filled the hospitals, Israeli operatives had opportunities to gather intelligence.

The method and scale of the attack – which Hezbollah ally Iran branded “mass murder” – are unprecedented but Israel has been carrying out assassinations and sabotage operations for decades.

Here are some of them:







Despite condemnation and escalating regional tensions, Israel has assassinated opponents in ways that may seem far-fetched even in some films.

On July 31, Hamas politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh and top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr were assassinated within hours of each other in Tehran and Beirut respectively, delaying prospects of a Gaza ceasefire again.

Shukr, a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), two children and a womanwere killed in an air strikethat hit a densely populated area in Beirut’s suburbs.

Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed in a residence for dignitaries in Iran’s capital Tehran.

The exact weapon and range have not been officially confirmed, but the projectile that killed Haniyeh was likely a compact, guided anti-fortification missile fired from only kilometres away, avoiding air defences.

However, unnamed Israeli sources claimed in media interviews that a bomb was planted in the room in advance.

Some in Hamas suggested Haniyeh’s use of WhatsApp or an insecure SIM card may have led Mossad operatives to his exact location.

In November 2020, Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was driving with his wife and bodyguards near Tehran when he was assassinated by a satellite-guided machinegun in broad daylight.

A one-tonne machinegun was smuggled into Iran in pieces by Mossad and set up on the back of a pick-up truck parked on the side of the road, according to reports by Israeli and Western media.

Iranian authorities said the gun had smart targeting technologies, only killing Fakhrizadeh in the backseat of the car,leaving his wife sitting next to him uninjured.

The truck exploded to destroy evidence after Fakhrizadeh was dead.

In the decade before Fakhrizadeh’s assassination, at least five other nuclear scientists were murdered to try to hobble the Iranian nuclear programme, some by sticky bombs put on their moving cars by masked agents on motorcycles.

Iran has also blamed Israel formultiple major sabotage attacks against its nuclear facilities, most notably the underground Natanz installations in Isfahan.

Israel and the United States were behind the infamous Stuxnet virus that corrupted systems and destroyed centrifuges, dealing a blow to the Iranian nuclear programme in 2010.

Israel has carried out cyberoperations inside Iran as well, including a cyberattack thatdisrupted services at most fuel stations across the countryin December 2023.

Banks, ports, railway systems, airports and other civilian infrastructure have also been hit over the years.

In a rare move in 2018, Israel claimed to have stolen a trove of documents about the Iranian nuclear programme in the early 2000s.

Netanyahu presented the alleged findings on national television.







Israel has been eliminating opponents in the two neighbouring countries for decades, claiming to target Iranian interests, taking advantage of its air superiority to launch many such operations, using fighter jets and armed drones.

Many senior Iranian, Palestinian and Lebanese military and political figures have been killed since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, includingsenior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouriin a strike on the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh in early January 2024.

The most high-profile attack on Syria since the start of the war on Gaza came at the beginning of April this year, when Israeli missiles destroyed a consular building of the Iranian mission to Damascus, killing 16 people, including two top IRGC generals.

Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation and Israel responded bylaunching multiple quadcopters– from inside Iran – at a military base in central Isfahan, damaging the radar system of a missile defence battery.

Israel gathers intelligence for operations through satellite and aerial surveillance, as well as a network of Israeli and local operatives in many countries. They are also allegedly assisted by intelligence from Western allies, particularly the US.

UsingPegasus spyware, Israel for years extracted secret information from people, government officials, journalists and companies, among others.







Assassinations have been part of the Israeli playbook as far back as the British-backed Zionist movement before Israel was founded byethnically cleansing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948.

In July 1956, Israel killed Egyptian army Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Hafez, who recruited forcibly displaced Palestinians to carry out attacks in Israel, with a parcel bomb.

Israel assassinated many people in the 20 years after the 1972 Munich Olympics – when 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were killed by the Palestinian Black September group – in Italy, France, Cyprus, Greece and Lebanon among other places.

Ali Hassan Salameh, who the Israelis believed was behind the Munich killings, was killed in Lebanon in January 1979, when a radio signal detonated a bomb in his vehicle.

Wadi Haddad, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is believed to have been poisoned by laced Belgian chocolates in East Germany in 1978.

Fathi Shaqaqi, co-founder and leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, was shot in front of a hotel in Malta in 1995.

A year later, chief Hamas bombmaker Yahya Ayyash was killed by explosives planted by Israel in a mobile phone.

Israel has failed sometimes.

During one of the failed attempts to kill Salameh, six of 15 Mossad operatives were convicted by Norwegian authorities for complicity in gunning down a Moroccan waiter they mistook for Salameh. The Israeli operatives were soon released in what became known as the “Lillehammer Affair”.

In 1997, then-Hamas politburo chief Khaled Meshaal was sprayed with poison by Israeli agents posing as Canadian tourists, who were arrested.

Jordan threatened to sever its security agreements with Israel, forcing Netanyahu to courier over the antidote that saved Meshaal’s life.

In exchange for the agents’ release and to resolve the crisis, Israel agreed to release spiritual leaderSheikh Ahmed Yassin, co-founder of Hamas.

In 2004, a wheelchair-bound Yassin was assassinated by missiles fired from an Israeli helicopter that also killed civilians leaving morning prayers at a mosque in the northern Gaza Strip.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/hezbollah-pagers-explode-has-israel-carried-out-such-attacks-before,NEGATIVE,0.9936841130256653
Pagers,"Lebanon explosions raise alarm about supply chain security, safety of tech","The use of pagers and walkie-talkies in back-to-back coordinatedexplosions in Lebanonhas drawn scrutiny to the security of global supply chains and their vulnerability to tampering by governments or other actors.

The utilisation of thousands of electronic devices in the apparent attacks, which are widely believed to have been orchestrated by Israel as part of an operation targeting Lebanon’s armed group Hezbollah, has raised the spectre of everyday communications equipment being weaponised in the future.

Tech companies are likely to see the attacks as a powerful reminder of the importance of securing their supply chains, while the general public’s trust in technology may also take a hit, tech industry and supply chain analysts told Al Jazeera.

“Every company that makes or sells physical devices will be worrying about the integrity of their supply chain,” said James Grimmelmann, Tessler Family professor of digital and information law at Cornell Tech and Cornell Law School in the United States.

“They are likely to consider adding additional safeguards and verifications so that they can better detect and prevent moves like this.”

While Israel has beenimplicated in assassinationsusing tampered communications devices before – including the 1996 killing of Hamas bombmaker Yahya Ayyash via an explosives-rigged mobile phone – the scale of the attacks, involving thousands of simultaneous detonations, was unprecedented.

At least 32 people were killed and more than 3,100 were injured in the explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday, including Hezbollah members and civilians, according to Lebanese authorities.







Brian Patrick Green, director of technology ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in the US, described the attacks as a potential watershed for the public’s trust in their electronic devices.

“Somehow thousands of devices were turned into weapons without anyone noticing it. How widespread are these explosive devices? How did the explosives get into the devices or the device supply chains? This attack raises terrifying questions that were never even considered before,” Green said.

Mariarosaria Taddeo, a professor of digital ethics and defence technologies at University of Oxford, said the attacks set a concerning precedent as they involved interference with the supply chain “not for a specific act of sabotage but for a distributed, highly impactful attack”.

“This scenario has been considered by experts but less so by state actors. If something good comes out of them, this is going to a public debate on control of the supply chain, strategic autonomy over digital assets, and digital sovereignty,” Taddeo said.

While it is unclear exactly how the pagers and walkie-talkies were turned into explosive devices, Lebanese and US officials have told multiple media outlets that Israeli intelligence booby-trapped the devices with explosive materials.

Israel has not commented to either confirm or deny responsibility.

Taiwanese company Gold Apollo, whose brand of pagers were used in the attacks, on Wednesday denied manufacturing the deadly devices, saying they had been made under licence by a company called BAC.

Gold Apollo’s CEO Hsu Ching-kuang told US radio NPR that BAC had paid his company through a Middle Eastern bank account that was blocked at least once by his firm’s Taiwanese bank.

BAC, which is based in Hungary’s capital Budapest, has not responded to requests for comment.

On Thursday, The New York Times, citing three unnamed intelligence officials, reported that BAC was an Israeli front set up to manufacture the explosive pagers.

Icom, a radio equipment maker based in Japan, said it had stopped producing the model of radios reportedly used in the attacks about 10 years ago.

“It was discontinued about 10 years ago, and since then, it has not been shipped from our company,” Icom said in a statement.

“The production of the batteries needed to operate the main unit has also been discontinued, and a hologram seal to distinguish counterfeit products was not attached, so it is not possible to confirm whether the product shipped from our company.”



Patrick Lin, director of Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), said there are important questions about where in the supply chain the devices were compromised.

“Was it during the manufacturing process, or in transit, or at the system operator’s level right before the devices are assigned to individuals?” Lin said.

“If it were done during the manufacturing process, then other technology manufacturers should be more concerned, as the other ways are outside their control. If the pager manufacturer wasn’t a willing accomplice in such a scenario, then their operational security was seriously compromised.”

However the devices may have been tampered with, the attacks could further accelerate moves towards technology that is “homegrown within a nation’s borders for tighter control of supply-chain security, whether it’s smartphones, drones, social media apps, whatever,” Lin said.

Milad Haghani, a supply chain expert at the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said he expects to see a “widespread reckoning” that will lead companies to tighten their supply chain security protocols.

“For tech companies in general, this situation is unprecedented in its scale, and many likely haven’t taken the security of their production processes as seriously before,” Haghani said.

“Many companies may not have been fully equipped to handle such threats,” he said, adding that the explosions in Lebanon will lead to a significant ramp-up in security efforts within organisations.

Smartphone giants such as Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Xiomi and LG are viewed as less vulnerable to being compromised than smaller companies, analysts said, citing reasons including their greater attention to security, the relatively targeted nature of the operation against Hezbollah, and the more limited space in their devices in which to place substances such as explosives.







“There will be curiosity but their production and delivery chains are completely different to small-scale companies, including vendors of counterfeit transceivers. So at least now there’s no reason to consider that they may be affected,” said Lukasz Olejnik, a visiting senior research fellow of the Department of War Studies of King’s College London.

“However, the big companies may be inclined to highlight the differences in their ways of doing things.”

Others expressed less confidence that Big Tech is immune from such concerns, pointing to the fact that companies rely on smaller suppliers that may make for easier targets or that they have cooperated with governments to target individuals in less deadly ways, most notably to spy on their communications.

“The Israeli government has already been accused of essentially using theNSO group’s spywareas a privatised intelligence service, and indeed just this week Apple dropped its suit against NSO out of fear that its security secrets would leak,” Grimmelmann said.

“This is deeply disturbing, and citizens should not allow their governments to literally weaponise consumer technology like this.”

Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Xiomi and LG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Andrew Maynard, a professor at the School for the Future of Innovation in Society at Arizona State University (ASU), said the attacks are bound to shift perceptions of personal electronics “from devices that are absolutely safe, to devices that could possibly be co-opted and used to cause serious harm”.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to see this leading to growing suspicion and anxiety over whether the devices people use on an everyday basis are safe, and serious efforts from major companies to assure their customers that they are,” Maynard said.

“There are also a number of broader ramifications to the attacks. Before September 17, the idea of using personal devices to take out a well-defined group of people wasn’t part of the global zeitgeist. Now it is.”







While supporters and critics of Israel have clashed over whether the attacks should be viewed as a discriminating blow against military targets or a reckless act that put civilians in harm’s way, the blasts have also raised the possibility of other actors taking inspiration from such tactics.

Haghani said that while it would be difficult for most actors to pull off such attacks, they raised the need to ensure that “non-state actors, who might have fewer moral boundaries, don’t exploit supply chains in this way”.

Maynard, the ASU professor, said non-state armed groups could see such tactics as a “plausible way to create fear and push their agendas”.

“In effect, a door has been opened to a new form of terror campaign – one where individuals face the possibility of the device in their pocket – or their child’s hand – becoming an agent of destruction,” he said.

“The counterargument to this is that it is still likely to be exceptionally costly and challenging to take an off-the-shelf phone for instance and weaponize it. But now that the idea is out there, the possibility of this has likely increased.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/9/19/lebanon-blasts-raise-alarm-about-supply-chain-security-tech-safety,NEGATIVE,0.990207850933075
Pagers,Lebanese people talk about fears after pager and walkie-talkie explosions,"Beirut, Lebanon– Electronicdevices exploded in south Beirut and other parts of Lebanonfor a second day on Wednesday, resulting in casualties and fires, a second attack blamed on Israel.

Twenty people were killed and more than 450 wounded in Wednesday’s attack, according to Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health. On Tuesday, thousands of Hezbollah pagers exploded,killing 12 people and wounding nearly 3,000.

The two attacks coming so close together hasleft many in Lebanon worriedabout their use of electronic devices and the state of the country’s security situation.

The attack allegedly targeted mobile phones, laptops, solar energy cells as well as walkie-talkie radios that were purchased at a similar time – about five months earlier – as the exploding pagers.

Devices exploded in cities including Beirut and its southern suburbs, Hermel, Baalbek, Saida, Nabatieh, Tyre, Naqoura and Marjayoun.

Officials were still conducting controlled explosions of suspicious devices found in locations around the country on Wednesday evening.

Thetension and worry it caused among Lebanese peoplewas heightened, as the devices said to be exploding on Wednesday were more “modern” and used more widely.

Event planner Maria Boustany has told her team to ditch the walkie-talkies they use to communicate at weddings and events due to doubts over their safety.

“It may not be the same brand but we really don’t know what’s happening,” she said.

Instead, Boustany said her team would be using WhatsApp to communicate.

“It’s better to be safe,” she said.

The team had not been using pagers.

Outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), relatives or friends of people wounded on Tuesday stood in groups the next day.

Neighbours greeted each other and inquired about others’ loved ones inside the hospital’s doors. Many were wearing black.

Inside, nurses were turning people away who had come to donate blood, telling them that so many people came to donate on Tuesday that they no longer needed blood on Wednesday.







While Tuesday necessitated a “Herculean effort” on the part of Lebanese healthcare, given the massive numbers of injuries, caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the hospitals were “managing” to cope with new injuries on Wednesday.

“We still have 140 patients in house and some are still going to surgeries,” Salah Zeineldine, AUBMC’s chief medical officer, told Al Jazeera. “We’ve frozen all elective … cases.”

Zeineldine noted that of the 140 patients, several are still critical but none are in life-threatening conditions. “A lot [of them] lost fingers or eyes,” he said.

Many of the people in front of AUBMC on Wednesday did not want to speak to the media.

On a nearby kerb, 40-year-old Ali agreed to chat, saying he had come to the hospital to visit a wounded person, without specifing his relationship to them.

A day earlier, he said, he had been in Beirut’s southern suburbs when he heard a series of explosions. “Every five to 10 seconds, I heard another,” he said.

Ali called Tuesday’s attack “stupid”, adding: “The people are strong and fear is the furthest thing from our minds.”

At nearby Clemenceau hospital, men lined the area outside the main entrance, waiting to visit loved ones.

Witnesses said that, while Beirut’s hospitals were busier than usual, they were much calmer than on Tuesday when all medical personnel were requested to report for duty to help treat the deluge of patients.

A doctor who reported for emergency duty at Mount Lebanon Hospital on Tuesday said the roads to the hospital were relatively empty – having been kept empty by authorities – but the vicinity of the hospital was crowded to the extent that they had to abandon their cars wherever they could.

By the time he arrived, the most serious life-threatening injuries had already been transferred to the operating rooms, which were at capacity.

The hospital was full of admitted patients, he said, three floors with at least 20 patients per floor.







He and other doctors began triaging, determining who was in urgent need of surgery to be scheduled, who needed antibiotics or tetanus shots, and who had injuries minor enough that they could be sent home.

All the patients he saw were men in or around their 30s with mild to moderate injuries – mostly to the face and hands.

“These were not nice injuries,” the doctor said. “They were frightening wounds but the patients were all calm. They were like: ‘Finish up with me and I’ll be OK.’

“They were calm … not scared or anxious.”

The attacks have left many Lebanese wondering what will happen next.

Social media was roiled with debates over whether the attacks were impressively precise or indiscriminate and a violation of international law.

Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged near-daily cross-border attacks since last October, Hezbollah saying they are fighting in support of Hamas and would cease fire should one be agreed in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Israel has intensified discussions about expanding the war against Hezbollah.

On Tuesday, Premier Benjamin Netanyahu announced an expansion ofIsrael’s war goalsto include returning families to their homes in the north, which many Israelis believe can only be accomplished through fighting Hezbollah.

The Northern Command’s top general was lobbying for a potential invasion into Lebanon, according to Israeli media. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday the war had entered “a new phase”.

For its part, Hezbollah has promised a response.

Speaking almost as the second attack took place, Hashem Safieddine, Hezbollah’s Executive Council chief, said Israel had initiated a “new confrontation” and the response to Tuesday’s attack would be a “special punishment”.

Pagers,Taiwan drawn into Middle East politics after deadly pager blasts in Lebanon,"Taipei, Taiwan –Taiwan’s crucial tech industry has been unwittingly drawn into Middle East politics after revelations that thousands of exploding pagersused to kill membersof Lebanon’s Hezbollah group were manufactured using the branding of a Taiwanese firm.

Taiwanese tech company Gold Apolloon Wednesdaydenied that it had manufactured the AR-924 model pagers thatexploded en massein Lebanon, saying they had been made by a European company named BAC through a licensing deal.

“According to the agreement, we authorise BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in specific regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are entirely handled by BAC,” Gold Apollo said in a statement.

“We only provide brand trademark authorization and have no involvement in the design manufacturing of this product,” the company added.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had no record of direct exports of the devices to Lebanon and that the pagers may have been modified after manufacturing. Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The New York Times and Reuters news agency, citing unnamed officials, reported that Israeli authorities had placed small amounts of explosive material in the pagers before the detonations.

Israel has not commented.

Analysts in Taiwan expressed doubt that the Taiwanese government or Gold Apollo would have willingly participated in the apparent attack, which Lebanese authorities say killed nine people and wounded more than 2,700 others.

Still, the incident draws unwelcome attention to Taiwan and its globally renowned tech industry, which produces the lion’s share of semiconductors used to power practically all electronics worldwide.

Jhy-Chern Liu, a professor at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, said he was “shocked” at the news and that people on the island were concerned.

“Even though Taiwan has been very close to the US in all aspects, I do not believe that any companies in Taiwan would be involved in a deadly plot like this, considering that Taiwan is an open society and a full democracy. Any hint of ideas like this is simply impossible and unthinkable,” Liu told Al Jazeera.

“I do not think the Gold Apollo company would be so unprofessional or stupid to be involved …,” Liu added.

While Taiwan is unlikely to have been directly involved, the incident nonetheless raises uncomfortable questions for Taiwan’s tech industry going forward, given its importance for global supply chains, said Yachi Chiang, a professor in tech law at National Taiwan Ocean University.

“This incident will be a huge, critical lesson for the industry,” Chiang told Al Jazeera.

“The Taiwan tech industry used to think they are only manufacturers of hardware, so they have nothing to do with politics, they are doing their own business. But not any more.”

The revelations have also brought the fallout of the war in Gaza to Taiwan’s front door.

Taiwan typically keeps its distance from global conflicts and geopolitical controversies except in cases involving China, whose government in Beijing claims the self-governing island as a province.

Since the war in Gaza began in October, Taipei has stayed largely silent on the number of Palestinian deaths, although it did condemn Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel.

Taiwan does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, which, like most countries, does not officially recognise Taipei, but they both have close ties with the US.

While Taipei is one of the most diplomatically isolated governments in the world with just 12 formal allies, it punches above its weight in global influence thanks, in part, to its powerful tech industry.

The island is home to TSMC, which manufactures about 90 percent of the world’s most advanced semiconductor chips, which make up the backbone of Taiwan’s export-dominated economy.

About two-thirds of Taiwan’s exports, which account for about 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), are classified as machinery and electronics, ranging from advanced iPhone chips to small components like the screws used in car engines.

Besides cutting-edge tech, Taiwan’s factories also produce more antiquated technology such as pagers, which run on less advanced chips than smartphones.

Taiwan’s economy is also dominated by small and medium enterprises such as Gold Apollo, which was founded in 1995 and specialises in pagers and small wireless communication devices used by restaurants and hotels.

Chiang said the incident in Lebanon highlighted the need for Taiwanese tech companies to pay more attention to their supply chains, even as Taipei has signed onto initiatives like the US-led Clean Network to keep Chinese tech out of Western telecom infrastructure.

“You may recall the United States, they advocated for the Clean Network, clean infrastructure – this is because in each of the links of this whole supply chain, it could be the weakest link, but we don’t know which link that might be,” she said.

“That’s why it’s necessary to have a whole clean network and whole clean infrastructure – you can see the necessity here.”

In Taiwan, where the public is used to China’s threats to “reunify” with the island by force if deemed necessary, Tuesday’s attack also prompted questions about the island’s security.

Some Taiwanese netizens wondered if pagers could be used in a similar attack by Chinese tech companies in the future.

“What we should worry about is that the other side of the Taiwan Strait will follow the same pattern and attack us,” one user wrote on the popular Reddit-like message board PTT.

“Taiwan just wants to sell things, okay?” another wrote. “How others mess around is the business of the Middle East.”

Pagers,"Hezbollah walkie-talkies exploded too, what to know about Israel’s attacks","One day after thousands of pagers exploded across Lebanon, moreexplosionsof handheld devices, including walkie-talkie radios, mobile phones, laptops and even solar power cells, have killed at least 20 people and injured 450.

Reports on Wednesday of several blasts quickly spread on messaging apps with people sharing images of exploded walkie-talkies and residential buildings on fire.

On Tuesday, some 4,000 pagers belonging to Hezbollah members had exploded over the course of an hour. Twelve people were killed and nearly 3,000 injured.

Here’s what we know:

Well, yes and no.

While fewer devices exploded, they were bigger and have caused more injuries.

Firass Abiad, Lebanon’s health minister, told Al Jazeera that “those who sustained serious injuries were severely affected”.

Information is still trickling in, but several blasts were reported in the southern suburbs of Beirut as well as in the southern city of Tyre on Wednesday afternoon.

Images posted on social media showed vehicles on fire and smoke rising from a residential area as reports came in of walkie-talkie radios and even solar cells exploding.

Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem witnessed one car explode during a funeral in southern Lebanon.

He noted that the explosion seemed to come from within the car rather than externally, as would be the case with a drone strike.







He described chaos on the streets with ambulances racing to pick up the injured and reports of more explosions coming in and spreading panic.

“Probably we are witnessing another wave, … really concerning given that yesterday’s incident already overwhelmed the whole health sector,” Hashem added.

There are reports of several different devices blowing up.

Chief among them are walkie-talkie radios, but there was also mention of mobile phones, laptops and even some solar energy systems.

Several cars reportedly exploded as well, but it is not clear if those were caused by the car itself exploding or something inside it.

A regular walkie-talkie is a handheld, two-way radio device that allows people to exchange messages with the walkie-talkie base or others holding mobile receivers.

They are short-range devices and need to stay close to their base to transmit.

The devices being called walkie-talkie radios are apparently IC-V82s, manufactured by the Japanese company ICOM, which would have a much bigger range than regular walkie-talkies.

The IC-V82 has not been produced for 10 years, ICOM said after the incidents.

Again, the details are not clear yet.

Some observers have wondered if Wednesday’s blasts were similar to what happened with the pagers.

With those, the supply chain might have been infiltrated and the devices loaded with 1 to 3 grammes (0.04 to 0.11oz) of a powerful explosive.

It seems that at least some Hezbollah members believe the explosions are linked to batteries.

Several of them quickly took the batteries out of their radios and tossed them away after one exploded during a funeral in a southern suburb of Beirut, according to the Reuters news agency.

Pagers use radio transmission and reception as does, of course, a radio.

Most of the impacted devices appeared to be communication systems, but there were also some reports of other devices exploding, like solar panels. At least one such explosion injured a girl.

Hezbollah and the Lebanese government have blamed Israel for the explosions. Israel has not commented.







Israel’s long-term strategy is unclear, but the attacks are a notable escalation against Hezbollah and Lebanon.

Analysts have long accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of escalating on one front after another to try to avoid facing any repercussions for his security failures and a corruption case he is on trial for.

His latest has been adding a “new war goal”, namely clearing the northern area by the Lebanese border so Israelis who had to evacuate from there could return.

Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday evening that the army would divert forces and resources from its near-yearlong war in Gaza to the north.

The attacks were a big security breach for Hezbollah as well as a potent tool ofpsychological warfarewith some analysts wondering if they have shaken the group’s image domestically.

Hezbollah’s communications apparatus appeared to remain operational, according to security and political analyst Elijah Magnier, who said after the first attack that thousands of older pagers were unaffected and the group had alternative secure communications in place.

As panic set in, people in Lebanon started disposing of their devices or taking them into shops to be checked.







On Wednesday, before the latest explosions, Hezbollah said it had attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets in the first strike on Israel since the initial attacks, according to Reuters.

“This attack by Israel is being seen in Lebanon as a terrorist attack because it has fed terror,” Al Jazeera correspondent Imran Khan said from Beirut. “People are scared.”

Magnier said Israel had successfully managed to “create confusion among Hezbollah and in society”.

He noted the cascading reports and climate of chaos as a sign that Israel’s strategy to wait more than 24 hours before the second detonations had been a successful one.

“This is exactly the objective of Israel – to create such confusion and prepare perhaps for a phase three,” he said.

“We have to wait and see what they are preparing next because this is not the end of it.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/more-devices-exploding-across-lebanon-whats-happening,NEGATIVE,0.9964510202407837
Pagers,Escalation fears spike as Hezbollah vows retaliation for pager attack,"Fears of escalation have spiked as Hezbollah promised retaliation against Israel which it blames for an attack in which pagerssimultaneously exploded.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Lebanese armed group warned that Israel awaits “a difficult reckoning” for thecoordinated attackon Tuesday, which killed 12 people and injured more than 2,800 in Lebanon and in parts of Syria.

The unprecedented cyberattack has revived fears thatsoaring tensions between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israelcould spiral into full-blown war.

The indiscriminateattack, which Israel has not commented upon but appears certain to have been conducted by Israeli security services, and the rhetoric emerging from Tehran also raises once more concerns that Israel’s war on Gaza threatens to prompt a regional conflagration.







Those worries have seen numerous global and regional states condemn the attack in Lebanon and call for calm, as Hezbollah said in a statement that it holds Israel “fully responsible” and that it will seek revenge.

Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed group which has also stressed that the attack will only increase its determination to press on with its operations against Israel to support Gaza, is due to deliver an address on Thursday.

The Foreign Ministry in Iran, whose own ambassador was injured in the attack, accused Israel of “mass murder”.

President Masoud Pezeshkian pointed his finger at Israel’s allies in the West.

“The incident once again showed that western nations and Americans fully support crime, killings and blind assassinations by the Zionist regime,” a statement on his website read.

In Egypt to discuss the latest efforts to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza,US Secretary of State Antony Blinkendenied that Washington had prior knowledge of the attack and stressed the need to “avoid taking steps that could further escalate conflict”.

Alongside him, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said that the attack would only see his country accelerate its efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave.

The growing risk of escalation drew condemnation and calls for calm on Wednesday.

Jordan’s foreign minister warned that Israel is pushing the Middle East to the brink of regional war.

“I can only condemn these attacks that endanger the security and stability of Lebanon, and increase the risk of escalation in the region,” the European Union’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said.

A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said: “It appears that the organisers of this high-tech attack deliberately sought to foment a large-scale armed confrontation in order to provoke a major war in the Middle East.”

Throughout the almost yearlong Gaza war, Hezbollah hasengaged in a parallel conflictwith Israel along its northern border, with the pair trading near-daily fire.

The exchanges have killed hundreds of mostly fighters in Lebanon, and dozens including soldiers in Israel, while forcing tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border to flee their homes.

Meanwhile, Israel has also carried out numerous presumed assassinations on Lebanese soil, including killing thegroup’s top commander Fuad Shukr.

Hours before its latest coordinated attack on Hezbollah, Israel announced it was broadening the aims of the Gaza war to include its fight against the group along its border.

Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told Al Jazeera that Israel may be sensing “a historic capability to decapitate [the group’s] capabilities as the war in Gaza winds down”.

“The jury is still out on what they really want, but I think the prospect that Israel wants escalation is higher now than it was earlier,” he said.

Concern has also been bubbling regarding the threat of an open conflict between Israel and Iran.

The two have swapped limited air raids in recent months, while Tehran is yet to react to theassassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyehin the Iranian capital in July.







Despite suffering a heavy security blow, Hezbollah says it will not back down in its defence of the Palestinian cause.

“What happened yesterday will increase our determination and resolve”, the group said.

The Lebanese government meanwhile gave indications that it is bracing for higher-intensity conflict.

Speaking to the press on Wednesday, Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said “we have to be ready and alert” and spoke of the need to stockpile medicine and fuel.

The attack shows Israel is “steering away from a diplomatic solution,” Abiad said.

Pagers,Lebanon files complaint against Israel at UN labour body over pager attacks,"Lebanon has filed a complaint against Israel with the United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO) over a string of deadly attacks involvingexploding pagersin September.

Lebanese Labour Minister Mustafa Bayram filed the formal complaint at the UN headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he said the attack was an “egregious war against humanity, against technology, against work”.

“It’s a very dangerous precedent if not condemned,” he said of the attacks, which Lebanon says killed and injured workers.

“We are in a situation where ordinary objects – objects used in daily life – become dangerous and lethal.”

The explosions onSeptember 23were purportedly aimed at targeting the Hezbollah armed group in Lebanon that used the devices to communicate.

The attack was widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied the allegation. Bayram said it was “widely accepted internationally … that Israel was behind this heinous act”.

The minister added that the casualty count was even higher than first reported, explaining that “more than 4,000 civilians fell – between martyrs and injured and maimed – in a few minutes by this attack.”

During a press conference in Geneva, Bayram was asked why he opted to file the complaint at the ILO, to which he replied that the workers who were harmed in the explosions were on the job.

“We deemed it necessary to point out that this runs contrary to work environment, security and safety, contrary to decent work principles … defended by the ILO,” he said.

He added that the Lebanese authorities could still file complaints about pager attacks in other international forums, including the World Trade Organization (WTO).







With the attack on the pagers in September, Israel began a more intense war on Lebanon.

Hezbollah and the Israeli army had already been trading attacks since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza in October 2023.

A week after the pager attack, Israel announced a ground operation in southern Lebanon as well as heavy air strikes on areas in Beirut’s southern suburbs and the eastern Bekaa Valley.

So far, more than3,000 peoplehave been killed in Lebanon and 13,492 injured since last October, according to Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health.

More than a million people have also been displaced due to Israel’s attacks on Lebanon.

In the latest attacks on Wednesday, Israeli strikes killed at least 30 people in Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley, according to the regional governor, while more strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/lebanon-files-complaint-against-israel-at-un-labour-body-over-pager-attacks,NEGATIVE,0.9843512773513794

Pagers,US downplays ability to prevent escalation after Lebanon pager explosions,"Washington, DC –The United States has said it does not want to see further escalation between Israel and Hezbollah after the Lebanese armed group blamed Israel for a series of deadly, coordinatedhandheld pager blasts.

But the administration of US President Joe Biden, which remains Israel’s top military and diplomatic backer, on Tuesday also sought to downplay its ability to tamper tensions between the pair.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday afternoon, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington was not involved in the apparent attack and was not given prior notification that it would occur.

“I will say that our overall policy remains consistent, which is, we do want to see a diplomatic resolution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,” Miller said. “We are always concerned about any type of event that may cause further escalation.”

But when pushed on whether theBiden administration’s influence– theUS provides Israelwith $3.8bn in military aid annually as well as staunch diplomatic support – could be used to prevent a wider war, Miller said that was “not just a question for the United States”.

“Of course, it’s a first … order question to Israel. It’s a question to Hezbollah, but is a question to all of the other countries in the region about what type of region they want to live in,” he said.

“So the United States is going to continue to push for a diplomatic resolution.”







Miller’s remarks come as rights advocates have urged the Biden administration to apply pressure on Israel to end its war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since early October and decimated the coastal Palestinian enclave.

Analysts have repeatedly accused Washington of acting as both an “arsonist and firefighter” by continually refusing to leverage US military aid to its “ironclad” ally despite the risks that a prolonged Gaza war could lead to a wider regional escalation.

Hezbollah, which has been exchanging cross-border fire with Israel since the war in Gaza began, blamed Israel for Tuesday’s pager blasts and pledged that it would get its “fair punishment”.

The Israeli army has yet to comment on the explosions.

The Lebanese health minister said at least nine people were killed, including an eight-year-old girl, when the pagers exploded across Lebanon. About 2,750 people also were injured, including 200 in critical condition.

Asked about the apparently indiscriminate nature of the explosions, Miller at the US State Department declined to comment directly on what happened.

However, he said that, broadly speaking, the US position is that “no country, no organisation should be targeting civilians”.







The explosions took place as the Biden administration continues to say it is pushing to broker aGaza ceasefire agreementbetween Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian faction that governs the territory.

On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was travelling to the Middle East for the latest meeting with mediators.

“President Biden doesn’t have a whole lot of time, the US election is less than 60 days away,” Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett reported from Washington, DC.

“So if [the Lebanon explosions] are something that Israel is in fact responsible for, this is certainly discouraging to the United States.”

The deadly blasts also came less than a day after White House adviser Amos Hochsteinmet withIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to push for de-escalation along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon.







Following the meeting, Netanyahu’s office released a defiant statement saying Israelis would not be able to return to evacuated areas along theLebanon border“without a fundamental change in the security situation in the north”.

Ramy Khoury, a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut, called the Israeli response to the US appeal “par for the course”.

“The Israelis routinely not only neglect what the Americans tell them, but throw mud in their face,” Khoury told Al Jazeera.

“The Americans have very limited capabilities in terms of their diplomatic action. They’ve focused more on military support for Israel and sanctions against Israel’s foes.”

Khoury added that US “diplomatic efforts are not taken very seriously by most people in the region” due to the country’sunconditional support for Israel.

“The US should be a huge diplomatic actor,” he said. “But it is clearly on the side of Israel and everything it does has to fit into the priorities of Israel.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/17/us-downplays-ability-to-prevent-escalation-after-lebanon-pager-explosions,NEGATIVE,0.995087206363678
Pagers,Big Brother without borders: Israel’s psychopathic warfare in Lebanon,"Exactly one week ago, on Tuesday, Israelremotely detonatedhundreds of handheld pagers used by members of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, killing at least 12 people. Two children were among the fatalities of the terror attack, which also wounded thousands and overwhelmed Lebanese hospitals.

The following day,walkie-talkies explodedacross the country, ending 20 lives. Two days after that, on Friday, anair strikeon a densely populated neighbourhood in the Lebanese capital of Beirut killed scores of people. And on Monday, the Israeli military commenced a patently psychopathic bombing spree over various sectors of Lebanon that haskilledmore than 550 people, including 50 children.









In addition to the physical bombardment, Lebanese phones are alsobeing bombardedwith evacuation warnings courtesy of Israel – a form of terror in their own right given Israel’s history of ordering folks to evacuate and then bombing them when they comply.

During Israel’s 34-day war on Lebanon in 2006, for example, 23 residents of the southern Lebanese village of Marwahin were slaughtered at close range by an Israeli military helicopter as they followed Israeli instructions to abandon their homes. Most of the dead were children.

To be sure, the very existence of the state of Israel has always been predicated on mass killing – an arrangement that has produced, inter alia, thecontinuing genocidein the Gaza Strip, where officially more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in less than one year but the true death toll is, no doubt,many times higher.

And yet the sudden onslaught of exploding Lebanese electronic devices and ramped-uppsychological warfareis taking Israel’s destructive efforts in an even more Orwellian direction than usual.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word Orwellian as “characteristic or suggestive of the writings” of British author George Orwell, especially of the “totalitarian state depicted in his dystopian account of the future, Nineteen Eighty-four”. The book was published in 1949 – incidentally one year after Israel’s bloody self-invention on Palestinian land – when the year 1984 was still 35 years away.

By the time 1984 actually rolled around, Israel had already expanded its experiment in inflicting regional dystopia to encompass Lebanon, as well, where the1982 Israeli invasionof the country killed tens of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians. And what do you know? It was this very apocalyptic invasion that occasioned the formation of Hezbollah, thereby ensuring another handy “terrorist” enemy whose acts of legitimate resistance would be exploited to justify Israeli aggression for the foreseeable future.

Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-four is also the source of the phrase “Big Brother is watching you” – a comment on surveillance regimes and one that has long applied to Israel, particularly in light of the state’s position at the vanguard of theglobal spyware industry. As with other components of Israel’s arsenal of repression, the marketability of Israeli hacking technologies is bolstered by the fact that all such expertise is battle-tested on Palestinians.

In anessayfor the Jerusalem Quarterly, titled Strategies of Surveillance: The Israeli Gaze, the late Palestinian sociologist Elia Zureik noted that Israel’s punitive surveilling of Palestinians had predated even the founding of Israel when data on Palestinian villages was compiled in order to facilitate conquest and dispossession.

Nowadays, Israel’sdraconian checkpointsin the West Bank constitute one of the many faces of Big Brother, while in Gaza, Israel’s implementation of an extensive facial recognition programme simply adds insult to genocide.

Over in Lebanon, meanwhile, we are seeing what happens when Big Brother is also capable of making your personal electronic devices explode – a crime that merits categorical denunciation as terrorism but that has nonetheless been hailed as a “sophisticated” attack in certain awestruck Western media outlets.

According to international humanitarian law, it is “prohibited in all circumstances to use any mine, booby-trap or other device which is designed or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering”. As per the law, “‘other devices’ means manually-emplaced munitions and devices including improvised explosive devices designed to kill, injure or damage and which are actuated manually, by remote control or automatically after a lapse of time”.

Then again, international law also prohibits the deliberate targeting of civilians, which has never stopped Israel from doing just that.

In the 2006 war on Lebanon, the Israeli military eliminated approximately 1,200 people, the vast majority civilians, and in the final days of the conflict, firedmillions of cluster munitionsat Lebanon, many of which failed to explode on impact and continued for years to wound and kill. So much for the prohibition on mines and booby traps.

As in the case of the exploding pagers, unexploded cluster bombs are not only weapons in and of themselves; they are also armaments of psychological warfare, designed to keep civilian populations good and terrorised.

With Israel now undertaking to normalise lethal surveillance and unrestrained psychopathy in both Gaza and Lebanon, admirers of last Tuesday’s “sophisticated” attack would do well to keep in mind that dystopia is a slippery slope.

Israel’s fundamental role in shaping surveillance infrastructure and fortifications on the United States-Mexico frontier is proof enough that Big Brother knows no borders. And as walkie-talkies blow up against a background of US-backed genocide, how will anyone ever draw the line?

Pagers,"For Lebanon, war is coming, but not this second","Beirut, Lebanon– Low-flying Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier twice over Beirut as Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah delivered his first speech since two days of attacks saw pagers and walkie-talkie radios explode across Lebanon.

The attacks – which killed Lebanese people, both Hezbollah members and civilians, including at least two children – came months after Nasrallah told supporters to stop using mobile phones because they might be compromised by Israel.

They also occurred amid escalating rhetoric from Israeli officials about intensifying operations on their northern front.

At least 37 people were killed and nearly 3,000 injured in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday.

More than 600 have died since October 8 when Hezbollah and Israel began trading attacks across the border. More than 100 were civilians.

Nasrallah appeared fatigued at the start of his speech on Thursday as he acknowledged the severity of the damage.

He called the attacks that tried to take out 5,000 people simultaneously a “major terrorist operation, an act of genocide and massacre”.







He admitted it was a “major blow … unprecedented in the history of the resistance”, but his energy grew as he gave his address, which included some of his signature provocations against Israel, specifically its prime minister.

“[Benjamin] Netanyahu, … we welcome an invasion. … We consider it an opportunity,” he said.

Referring to Israel’s goal stated on Thursday to make conditions near its border with Lebanon safe enough for residents who have fled Hezbollah attacks to return, Nasrallah said: “I promise you, you won’t be able to bring the settlers back to their homes.”

Strong words aside, Nasrallah didn’t indicate when or where a response would take place.

People close to Hezbollah promised a stunning response after such staggering attacks.

“The response will be gradual, escalating and painful,” Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese political analyst believed to be close to the group, told Al Jazeera.

That defiance cannot be reckless, other analysts said, if Hezbollah wants to avoid taking further losses in morale and personnel.

“The recent Israeli attack on Hezbollah exposed serious weaknesses and vulnerabilities,” Imad Salamey, a professor of political science at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, told Al Jazeera.

“Hezbollah must now be extremely cautious in its response. … I believe Hezbollah’s retaliation will be delayed as it regroups with the goal of regaining the initiative and surprise while also awaiting a potential settlement in Gaza before acting.”

Hezbollah’slast major retaliationwas in response to Israel assassinating the group’s commander Fuad Shukr. That response on August 25 saw more than 300 rockets fired and drones launched at Israeli bases.

“We can certainly say that Hezbollah’s reaction to the assassination of Fuad Shukr was not enough to re-establish deterrence,” Karim Emile Bitar, professor of international relations at St Joseph’s University in Beirut, told Al Jazeera.

“This so-called equilibrium of terror is no longer holding.”

For many in Lebanon, the last few days have been surreal.







“We seem to be living in a Netflix series or in a dystopia,” Bitar said.

“It’s unprecedented in the history of warfare in the Middle East, and we have seen an awful lot of tragic events.”

The strikes on Hezbollah’s communications also made some Lebanese people worry that an Israeli invasion would follow soon after.

Analysts told Al Jazeera that while they do not believe an invasion is imminent, that doesn’t mean Israel will not expand its aggressions against Iran-backed Hezbollah.

“There is definitely a risk of a wider war,” Bitar said.

“It will be extremely difficult for the Iranian axis and for Hezbollah to find the appropriate way of retaliating without giving Netanyahu the pretext he is desperately looking for to wage this all-out offensive.”

Former United States special forces officer Seth Krummrich, who is now at the Global Guardian risk management firm, said the pager strikes sent a “very clear message” to Hezbollah.

But he added this may not achieve Israel’s stated goal of returning displaced Israelis to its northern border because the recent events show the two sides only drifting further away from a negotiated agreement.

“The warring parties are moving farther apart every day, and senior voices in the region are saying behaviour has to change,” Krummrich said. “If Israel ploughs forward, … then this is going to be an extended, horrible conflict.”

Analysts said if there was one thing made abundantly clear from the last few days, it was that the technological edge is overwhelmingly in Israel’s favour.

Nasrallah admitted as much in his speech.

“We acknowledge that the enemy has technological supremacy, especially as it is backed by the United States and the collective West,” he said.

Pro-Hezbollah Telegram groups reported the hacking of some Israeli websites, including the pages of some Israeli municipalities, on Wednesday.

But technological advantages alone cannot win a war, Krummrich said.

“The technological advantage is a mirage,” he said “If you have the will and the people and belief, you still have the ultimate advantage because war presents itself as constantly changing.”

“Both Israel and Hezbollah have that belief, and that is not usually the case in conflict,” Krummrich added. “And that concerns me greatly [because without a negotiated settlement] it’s only going to get worse and worse and worse.”

Pagers,Remote attacks push Hezbollah and Israel to the brink of war,"Lebanon has suffered two days of seemingly random explosions of hand-held communication devices used by Hezbollah members across the country and in Syria. Analysts say this has opened a new chapter in the decades-old conflict between the two sides.

After detonations of pagers and“walkie-talkie” radio handsetsacross two days, the death toll in Syria and Lebanon stands at 37, with thousands injured.

In keeping with many previous attacks, Israel has yet to admit responsibility or comment on events.

In a statement shortly after yesterday’sdetonations, Hezbollah said: “We hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible,” adding that Israel “will certainly receive its just punishment for this sinful aggression”.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a mostly low-level conflict since Israel launched an assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 41,000 people in ostensible retribution for a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7.

In recent weeks, domestic turmoil, speaking directly to the political survival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has conspired with military pressure to confront Hezbollah and the push of 60,000 or so Israeli citizens evacuated from the north after October 7 to return home.

In late July, Israel escalated its long campaign of assassinating its opponents, killing Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran almost simultaneously.

Many expected that those killings might trigger a wider regional war, one inevitably drawing Iran into a conflict that it has so far avoided. However, beyond arelatively managed exchange of firebetween Hezbollah and Israel in late August, no major response has been forthcoming.







Nevertheless, according to analysts, these latest attacks eclipse previous provocations and, cutting as it does to the heart of Hezbollah, may force the retaliation that both its leadership and its allies seem to prefer avoiding.

In February, as the body countof Hezbollah operatives killed by Israel reached the hundreds, the group’s Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah instructed the group’s members to break, bury or lock away the mobile phones they had been using, describing them as more dangerous than Israeli spies.

In their place, the group imported 5,000 low-tech pagers that now seem to have been intercepted and booby-trapped as part of a joint operation byIsrael’s intelligence service, Mossad, and its military.

Attacks on Hezbollah’s communication system appear designed to lever one of Israel’s principal advantages.

“Israel would have been at a disadvantage if it had launched a ground invasion of Lebanon,” Karim Emile Bitar, professor of international relations at l’Université Saint-Joseph de Beyrouth said.

“Hezbollah knows the territory better and [it] has been trained through its participation in the war in Syria.

“They are no longer purely a guerilla movement, fighting an occupation. They’re also an organisation capable of launching attacks,” Bitar continued.

However, he added: “When it comes to defending against new technology and cyberattacks, they are definitely weaker than Israel.”

New reporting from the website Al Monitor suggests that these devices had been earmarked for tampering in anticipation of a wider military action, rather than yesterday’s seemingly random attack.

“Al-Monitor’s sources emphasised that this was not the original plan nor was it the Israeli government’s preferred course of action, opting instead to save such an operation for a full-blown conflict,” Al Monitor said.

Editorials in Israeli outlets such as The Jerusalem Post, which celebrated “chaos in [Hezbollah’s] ranks”, point to heightened confidence in Israel’s military and technological superiority.

But they also hint at a degree of trepidation over the inevitable response of an opponent that has so far withstood the force of what many in Israel regard as its elite military.

However, while some of the general public may be wary, according to former Israeli ambassador Alon Pinkas, those within the political leadership who had been pushing for an assault on Lebanon would be emboldened by the attack.

“The idiots think life is a James Bond movie,” he noted by text.







“They have to retaliate,” Nicholas Blanford, an expert on Hezbollah with the Atlantic Council said of the group’s options.

“I think there’s going to be a lot of grassroots pressure from the support base, from the Hezbollah fighters,” even those not affected directly, to retaliate to what Blanford termed an “unprecedented” attack.

“That’s going to make life difficult for the leadership,” Blanford said, referring both to Hezbollah’s leadership in Lebanon and that of their ally and principal sponsor, Iran.

“The leadership doesn’t want to go to war,” he said.

“The Iranians don’t want Hezbollah to go to war,” he continued, pointing to what he described as the lacklustre response to the killing of Shukr in Beirut.

“It took them almost a month to retaliate, and then the retaliation was fairly feeble, at least in the eyes of the Hezbollah support base, which will make it very difficult for the leadership to carry out another token retaliation,” he said.

However, while the push to escalate may be growing among both Hezbollah’s ranks and elements of the Israeli leadership, the group’s ability to respond, at least in the short term, has rarely been less certain, defence analyst Hamze Attar told Al Jazeera.

With its supply lines compromised and much of the electronic equipment it relies upon now viewed with suspicion, the group’s ability to retaliate is growing questionable.

“This wasn’t just about pagers, this cut to the very heart of Hezbollah,” Attar said.

“Hezbollah now needs to review its entire supply chain. Everything, from their encoders to decoders, remote controls, transmitters, receivers: everything,” he said.

Attar described how the Israeli technique of inserting small explosives next to devices’ volatile lithium batteries had also left every other piece of Hezbollah technology that relied upon their use uncertain.

“This is disruption on a massive scale. Through this attack, they’ve essentially removed thousands of fighters from the battlefield without firing a shot.”

The attacks, Attar said, had “essentially created a new reality in clandestine operations”.

Pagers,‘Civilian objects should not be weaponised’: UN chief on Lebanon blasts,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says civilian objects should not be weaponised aftera deadly wave of explosionsacross Lebanon targeted communication devices used by Hezbollah.

“I think it’s very important that there is an effective control of civilian objects, not to weaponise civilian objects. That should be a rule that … governments should be able to implement,” Guterres said on Wednesday at a briefing at UN headquarters in New York.

Hundreds of wireless paging devices belonging to members of the Iran-backed groupexploded simultaneouslyon Tuesday, hours after Israel said it was broadening the aims of the Gaza war to include its fight against Hamas’s Lebanese ally. The explosions on Tuesday killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded up to 2,800.

Guterres warned that “there is a serious risk of a dramatic escalation in Lebanon, and everything must be done to avoid the escalation”.

“What has happened is particularly serious not only because of the number of victims that it caused but because of the indications that exist that this was triggered, I would say, in advance of a normal way to trigger these things because there was a risk of this being discovered.”

Later on Wednesday,more device blastsacross Lebanon killed at least nine people and wounded about 300, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Health.

Lebanon’s state media reported that walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members blew up in Beirut on Wednesday with reports of similar blasts in southern and eastern Lebanon.







Hezbollah, which has traded near daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in support of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, said it will retaliate for the pager blasts, which it blamed on Israel.

Israel has not yet commented on the explosions.

Meanwhile, Volker Turk, the UN’s human rights chief, said in a statement on Wednesday that those responsible for the deadly wave of explosions across Lebanon “must be held to account”.

“Simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, without knowledge as to who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law and, to the extent applicable, international humanitarian law,” he said.

Pagers,Second wave of blasts hits Lebanon as Israel declares ‘new phase’ of war,"At least 20 people have been killed and 450 wounded in Lebanonin a new wave of blastsrelated to communication devices, the Ministry of Public Health says, a day after thousands of pagers used by Hezbollahdetonated across the country.

The attacks, which were widely believed to be carried out by Israel against Hezbollah, have raised fears that the two sides’ simmering conflict could escalate into all-out war.









Speaking to Israeli soldiers on Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: “We are at the start of a new phase in the war. It requires courage, determination and perseverance.”

He made no mention of the explosions of electronic devices on Tuesday and Wednesday but praised the work of Israel’s army and security agencies, saying, “The results are very impressive.”

Multiple explosions were reported across Lebanon on Wednesday with the state-run National News Agency saying pagers and “devices” exploded in Hezbollah strongholds in eastern and southern Beirut as well as in the eastern region of Bekaa, where three people were wounded.

Hezbollah’s al-Manar TV reported explosions in multiple locations, which it said were the result of walkie-talkies detonating.

Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Tyre in southern Lebanon, witnessed two explosions.

“There was a car that exploded just behind us. At the same time, there was an explosion at another place [nearby],” he said. “I’m currently in the middle of the street. There are a lot of ambulances, chaos everywhere.”

Several blasts took place simultaneously, Hashem said, similar to the explosions on Tuesday.

“But this time, it was mostly walkie-talkies or radios [that exploded],” he said, adding that reports suggested that solar devices and some batteries in cars also detonated. The National News Agency reported that home solar energy systems exploded in several areas of Beirut.

In Wednesday’s attacks, several blasts were heard at a funeral in Beirut for three Hezbollah members and a child killed by exploding pagers the day before, according to journalists with The Associated Press news agency at the scene.

An AP photographer in the southern coastal city of Sidon saw a car and a mobile phone shop damaged after devices exploded inside of them. A girl was hurt in the south when a solar energy system blew up, the state news agency reported.

In Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said a blast was reported in Dahiyeh, a southern suburb of Lebanon’s capital city.

The new round of explosions took place a day after pagers exploded nearly simultaneously in locations across Lebanon, killing at least 12 people, including two children, and wounding about 2,800. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for Tuesday’s attacks.

Israel has not directly commented on the blasts.

The attackshave shaken the civilian populationwith a stream of bloodied people overwhelming hospitals in Hezbollah strongholds of Beirut. Health authorities have called on all available medics to report for duty.







Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s explosions took place after Israel announced the expansion of its war goals to include northern residents returning to their homes near the border with Lebanon.

Tens of thousands of people have left northern Israel since the start of the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas-led attacks on October 7 in southern Israel, where more than 1,100 people were killed and about 250 were taken captive.

Israel has waged a brutal assault on the Gaza Strip since then, killing more than 41,000 people and reducing large swaths of the Palestinian territory to rubble.

Since October 8, Hezbollah has engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces along the Lebanon-Israel border in support of Hamas.

On Wednesday, Hezbollah said Israel was “fully responsible for this criminal aggression” and reiterated it would avenge the latest attacks while saying it would continue its fight against Israel in support of Hamas in Gaza.

Cross-border exchanges with Israeli forces were “ongoing and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre”, Hezbollah said.

Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib warned the “blatant assault on Lebanon’s sovereignty and security” on Wednesday was a dangerous development that could “signal a wider war”.

United Nations chief Antonio Guterres called for “maximum restraint”.

“The secretary-general urges all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation,” his spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said in a statement.

Pagers,US lawmaker Rashida Tlaib slams racist image of her with exploding pager,"Palestinian-American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has condemned as racist a cartoon that depicts her with a detonating pager, days after thousands ofcommunication devices explodedacross Lebanon in attacks blamed on Israel.

“Our community is already in so much pain right now. This racism will incite more hate + violence against our Arab & Muslim communities, and it makes everyone less safe,” Tlaib said of the cartoon published in conservative magazine National Review.

“It’s disgraceful that the media continues to normalize this racism,” the only Palestinian-American lawmaker in the United States Congress wrote on X on Friday.

Created by Henry Payne, the cartoon shows a woman sitting at a desk with a name card reading “Rep. Tlaib” where a device explodes. The woman remarks: “ODD. MY PAGER JUST EXPLODED.”

Thank you, Mayor@AHammoudMI, for speaking up. Our community is already in so much pain right now. This racism will incite more hate + violence against our Arab & Muslim communities, and it makes everyone less safe. It’s disgraceful that the media continues to normalize this…https://t.co/JTn2mur4Yj

The illustration alludes toattacksin Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday when thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded killing at least 37 people and wounding nearly 3,000, including civilians.

After the attacks, Tlaib shared a post by fellow Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez referring to it as a clear violation of “international humanitarian law”.







Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan in the US House of Representatives who is a vocal critic of Israel’s war on Gaza, has often weathered harsh vitriol from Republican and some Democratic opponents, including baseless accusations of sympathies with Hamas.

In November, Tlaib wasformally censuredby the House, a step just below expulsion, for allegedly “promoting false narratives” about the Gaza war and “seeking Israel’s destruction”, charges she rejects.

Tlaib said at the time she “will not be silenced and I will not let you distort my words”.

Tlaibvoiced her supporton Thursday for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, criticising her colleagues in the US Congress for their silence asUS-funded weaponscontinue to fuel bloodshed in the besieged enclave.

“We are living through one of, again, the most documented horrific crimes against humanity in our history. These are children who did not live to see their first birthday. We cannot normalize this,” said Tlaib.

“My colleagues continue to be silent. I wonder if it’s because these babies are Palestinian? They’re children, that’s it,” she added.

Pagers,Iran warns Israel of ‘crushing response’ after attacks on Hezbollah,"Israel will face “a crushing response from the axis of resistance”, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, has told Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, according to state media.

Salami made the statement on Thursday after unprecedented attacks in the previous two days on Hezbollahpagers and walkie-talkies, which killed 37 people andwounded more than 2,900when hundreds of devices were detonated almost simultaneously.

The “axis of resistance” refers to Iran-aligned armed groups in the Middle East, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Yemen’s Houthis and Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Forces.

Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday. Israel has not directly commented on the blasts, but security sources said they were probably carried out by its Mossad spy agency.

“Such terrorist acts are undoubtedly the result of the Zionist regime’s [Israel’s] despair and successive failures. This will soon be met with a crushing response from the axis of resistance, and we will witness the destruction of this bloodthirsty and criminal regime,” Salami said in his message to Nasrallah.







Fears of a regional conflagration reignite

Iran and Israel frequently exchange threats of mutual destruction. Their hostilities peaked in April when Iran launcheddrones and missilesin its first direct attack against Israel in response to a deadly Israeli strike on its embassy in Syria, which killed 13 people.

Tensions ratcheted up again in July when, within hours of one another, Israel killedHezbollah commander Fuad Shukrin Beirut and Hamas’s political leaderIsmail Haniyehwas killed in Tehran after attending President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration.

Many expected those killings might trigger a wider regional war, but so far, no major response has been forthcoming.

In a speech on Thursday, his first since this week’s attacks in Lebanon, Nasrallah said the blasts targeting Hezbollah members are “a declaration of war”, and hepromised retaliationwithout giving a timeline for a response.

Nasrallah conceded Hezbollah had suffered a “major and unprecedented” blow. But he also struck a defiant tone, saying Israel would face a “just punishment”.

As he delivered his televised address, Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier over Beirut.







Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said after the speech that Hezbollah “will pay an increasing price” as Israel seeks to return residents to its northern areas, which were evacuated as a result of tit-for-tat attacks with Hezbollah across the border with Lebanon that began after Israel launched its war on Gaza on October 7.

The exchanges of fire have forced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border to flee their homes.

On Thursday, the Israeli military said it struck six Hezbollah “infrastructure sites” and a weapons storage facility overnight in southern Lebanon, a stronghold of the group.

Lebanon’s official National News Agency also reported Israeli strikes and shelling on several towns in the south.

The Israeli military said two of its soldiers were killed near the border with Lebanon.

On Sunday, Yemen’s Houthislaunched what they saidwas a hypersonic missile at central Israel, causing fires, triggering air raid sirens and sending residents running for shelter in the area around Ben Gurion Airport.

Pagers,The Take: Deadly pager attacks leave Lebanon in shock,"

Lebanon is reeling after two days of coordinated attacks attributed to Israel that detonated thousands of pagers and devices used by Hezbollah members. The simultaneous explosions – in indiscriminate locations across the country – left deaths and thousands of injuries in their wake. Does this unprecedented attack signal a new reality?

Pagers,Hezbollah’s Nasrallah says Israel’s Lebanon attacks crossed ‘all red lines’,"Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says thepager and walkie-talkie attacksagainst its members in Lebanon and Syria this week crossed “all red lines” and the group will retaliate and is undeterred in its fight against Israel in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

In his first televised speech since theunprecedented attacks, which took place over two days and killed at least 37 people, Nasrallah on Thursday called them a “big blow in terms of security and humanity” but said they have failed to bring the group to its knees.

The blasts, which the Iran-backed group blames on Israel, wounded more than 2,900 people, of whom 287 are in a critical condition, and have heightened fears that 11 months of near-daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel will escalate into all-out war.

In keeping with many previous attacks, Israel has yet to admit responsibility or comment on the blasts.

In recent weeks, Israeli leaders have stepped up warnings of a potential larger military operation against Hezbollah, saying they are determined to stop the group’s fire to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to homes near the border with Lebanon.

As Israeli jets carried out sonic booms over Lebanon during his speech, Nasrallah called Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s simultaneous explosions a “terrorist act” and a “declaration of war” against the people of Lebanon and the country’s sovereignty.

He conceded the attacks were “unprecedented in the history of the resistance movement in Lebanon” as well as “in the history of our country” and “our enemy”.

But Nasrallah said Hezbollah would continue supporting Palestinians in Gaza “no matter what the consequences are, what the sacrifices are, what scenarios will unfold”.

“From October 8 until now, the Israeli forces did not pull out any of their military personnel in the north,” the Hezbollah leader said in the speech, warning that Israelis who have evacuated from the area would not be allowed to return.

He said the devices exploded inside hospitals, markets, homes and several areas where civilians were present and Israel had “wilfully” targeted 4,000 pagers and 1,000 walkie-talkies with the aim to kill as many people as possible.

He added that some of the attacks took place in hospitals, pharmacies, marketplaces, commercial shops and even homes, private vehicles and on public roads where thousands of civilians, including women and children, are present.

Nasrallah also stressed the assaults were partially foiled as “many devices were out of service, turned off [or] kept away”.

He added that what happened did not impact the group’s command, control or infrastructure.

“I reassure you our infrastructure has not been touched,” he said.







Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a mostly low-level conflict since Israel launched an assault on Gaza on October 7, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.

In late July, Israel killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran almost simultaneously, triggering fears of an escalation.

Al Jazeera senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said there will likely be further escalation in the coming days or weeks as Hezbollah responds to the attacks.

“He is down, but he is defiant,” Bishara added, referring to the Hezbollah leader. “[But] it’s a major blow to Hezbollah. There is no doubt about that.”

Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Lebanon, said ultimately there was “nothing revealing” about how Hezbollah might respond to the attacks.

“After Nasrallah’s speech, we don’t know what’s really going to happen,” he said.

“But at the same time, there was something that felt ambiguous when he spoke about keeping the accountability or the retaliation within a very small circle. I think he spoke about the investigation within the organisation, within Hezbollah.”

Analyst Sultan Barakat pointed out that Nasrallah did not give any clear indication how the group would retaliate.

“We have an answer from him that he’s definitely going to come back but without saying when and how,” Barakat, a professor of public policy at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera, adding that the speech aimed to present a “partial win” for Hezbollah.

Meanwhile, two Israeli soldiers were killed and several injured in attacks by Hezbollah in northern Israel on Thursday.

The Israeli army also announced new attacks on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon “to degrade Hezbollah’s terrorist capabilities and infrastructure”, adding in a statement that it was part of efforts to return displaced Israelis to their homes in the north.

Pagers,What is Hezbollah?,"A dramatic Israeli attack on Hezbollah has driven speculation that all-out war may be on the books soon between the two.

Thousands of pagers exploded on September 17, 2024, most of them were in the close possession of Hezbollah members. For an hour, one explosion after the other occurred, spreading panic and in some cases killing children who were near their fathers’ pagers.

Hospitals, especially in Beirut, were overflowing with injured people, and an urgent call went out for everyone capable to donate blood to help treat the injured.

Back-and-forth attacks between Hezbollah and Israel have been ongoing since October 8, 2023, a day after Israel launched its war on Gaza.

As observers wait with bated breath to see what happens next, here’s everything you need to know: What is Hezbollah?

Here’s everything we know:

Hezbollah (Party of God in Arabic) is an Iran-backed group that formed in 1982 to fight Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon.

The group, which finds most of its support among Shia Muslims, is one of Israel’s biggest foes in the region.

The group says it has precision rockets that can hit all parts of Israel and, as of 2021, its leader Hassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah had 100,000 fighters.

The United States estimates Iran allocated hundreds of millions of dollars annually to Hezbollah in recent years.

The group, headed by Nasrallah since 1992, is one of the most influential political blocs in Lebanon and is often dubbed “a state within a state” due to its vast political and military network.

When it formed, Hezbollah aimed to get Israel out of Lebanon.

Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon in 2000 after nearly 20 years of fighting.

Hezbollah proclaimed itself the first Arab army ever to force Israel to cede control of territory.

Israel still occupies Syria’s Golan Heights and Palestinian territories it took in the 1967 War.

Hezbollah released a manifesto [PDF] after its formation, highlighting objectives that included defeating Israel and expelling Western colonialist entities from the Middle East.

In a cross-border raid in July 2006, Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers, which it hoped would secure a prisoner swap with Israel.

Israel responded militarily, resulting in a 34-day war also called the July War.

Neither side wasable to prevail militarily, but more than 1,100 Lebanese and 165 Israelis were killed.

Nasrallah has often said the 2006 war was a success for Hezbollah, noting it withstood Israel’s much larger forces.

Hezbollah is widely believed by analysts to be the only non-state actor in the region that could take on Israel.

Hezbollah is a Lebanese organisation, Hamas is a Palestinian group that formed in Gaza in 1987 after the beginning of the first Intifada against Israel’s occupation.

They are separate entities but share the objective of armed resistance against Israel.

Hamas has governed the Gaza Strip since being elected in 2006.

After aHamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, Hezbollah said it was in close contact with Palestinian resistance leadership and that the attack had been a “decisive response to Israel’s continued occupation and a message to those seeking normalisation”, referring to Arab countries rumoured to be about tonormalise ties with Israel.

Given the latest verbal sparring and escalated strikes, there are real fears that that will happen.

And, analysts have long said, Palestinian factions in Lebanon areeager to open a second frontif Hezbollah initiates an attack.

As the unspoken rules of engagement the two sides have stuck to so far get shakier, it remains to be seen if there will be a spark.







The US and other Western countries consider Hezbollah a “terrorist organisation”. Saudi Arabia also considers it a “terrorist” group.

The European Union classifies Hezbollah’s military wing as a “terrorist group”, but not its political wing.

Hezbollah has ministers in government and lawmakers in parliament.

The group became more politically prominent after its close ally Syria withdrew from Lebanon following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005.

Hariri was seen as a symbol of Saudi influence in Lebanese politics.

In 2016, the Hezbollah-endorsedMichel Aounbecame president. Two years later, Hezbollah and its allies won a majority in the country’s first general election in nine years.

In 2022, Hezbollah’s bloc lost its majority but the group continues to feature large the country’s politics.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/10/what-is-hezbollah-a-look-at-the-lebanese-armed-group-backing-hamas,NEGATIVE,0.9929587841033936
Pagers,The ‘brilliant’ way Israel kills innocents,"By now, save her family and friends, the short life and dreadful death of 10-year-old Fatima Abdallah Jaafar will likely have been forgotten.

But the sick circumstance of how, where and why Fatima was killed requires remembering.









It requires remembering because her sudden, disfiguringdeathstands a searing antidote to the almost giddy celebration of the “ingenious” ways Israel devises to assassinate its adversaries.

It is also a halting harbinger of the scores of other innocents who are bound to perish as the Middle East appears destined to be engulfed by an even wider war. In 48 hours alone, 50 children have been killed in Lebanon – all casualties of the latest Israeli strikes.

Fatima and an 11-year-old boy, Bilal Kanj, were killed during the first wave of Israeli attacks targeting Hezbollah fighters involving pagers housing explosives that detonated simultaneously at 3:30pm on September 17 throughout Lebanon and Syria.

Fatima had just arrived home from the first day of the new school year. She was in fourth grade. Her aunt remembered how eager Fatima was to learn English.

“Fatima was trying to take courses in English,” she said. “She loved English.”

Fatima was in the kitchen when a pager, resting on a table, began beeping. She picked up the device, intending to deliver it to her father. En route, it exploded.

Fatima’s small, cherubic face turned instantly into a mangled mess. The room was now awash in the schoolgirl’s blood – an awful testament to the improvised bomb’s lethal force.

At her funeral held in Lebanon’s Bekka Valley, grieving classmates carried a large picture of Fatima aloft. Her mother, walking alongside a tiny flower-draped coffin, wept.

Mourners paused in the town square before heading to a nearby cemetery. There, they prayed while a religious elder appealed to God “for justice”.

Fatima’s death was of little, if any, consequence to thehostof Western journalists and so-called “security experts” who “marveled at the complexity” of Israel’s covert “plot” to infiltrate Hezbollah on such a “colossal” scale.

Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. Still, it is widely believed that the country’s security services were responsible for organising and committing the attacks.

It is, of course, a familiar story. Children – whether they are orphaned, traumatised, dismembered or slain in Gaza, the occupied West Bank or Lebanon – are considered disposable fodder as Israel continues to vent, unchecked, its “killing rage”.

Fatima and the thousands of children in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon who have already been killed and will be killed have been reduced to an inconvenient asterisk in the myopic minds of Israel’s legion of cheerleaders abroad.

Among them is Artur Wilcynski, a former Canadian ambassador and senior security official, who promptly took to X to describe Israel’s ruthless gambit that claimed the budding lives of Fatima Abdallah and Bilal Kanj as “brilliant”.

“Today’s targeting of Hezbollah operatives was brilliant. It struck a major blow against a terror group that has fired thousands of rockets against civilians all while the useless UN mission in Lebanon stands by. There is a price to pay,” Wilcynskiwrote.

That the deaths of Fatima and Bilal were a shocking measure of the “price” that Lebanese civilians had to “pay” did not deter Wilcynski frompostingwhat the retired Canadian diplomat apparently considered a pithy GIF just hours after the deadly explosions began.

The GIF features two popular Looney Tunes cartoon figures. In the short scene, Road Runner frightens Wile E Coyote. The caption reads: “Beep beep.”

Later, in response to a tweet by acclaimed Palestinian writer Mariam Barghouti, pointing out that the victims of Israel’s “premediated” attack included children, Wilcynski posted another GIF – this time, of a movie star in character, applauding.

Wilcynski’s egregious posts triggered a fierce and sustained backlash – particularly given that, only months earlier, he had been appointed the University of Ottawa’s “special advisor” on anti-Semitism.

In a cockeyed bid to explain away his damning posts, Wilcynski claimed that the cartoon GIF was, in fact, “a statement about persistent attempts to kill Jews over the centuries that fail”.

No, sir. Posting a snippet of a cartoon to make “a statement” about the murderous pogroms Jews have endured “over the centuries” is an outrageous affront to the memory of millions of victims – girls and boys, women and men.

Remember, the author of this obscene absurdity was a career and decorated civil servant promoting Canada’s values and interests at home and overseas and was charged with confronting anti-Semitism on a university campus.

My goodness.

Not done embarrassing himself, Wilcynski turned amateur psychoanalyst by suggesting that his online detractors – who chastised him for “joking” about children’s deaths – were guilty of “morbid projection”.

Then, Wilcynski trotted out the predictable, exculpatory bromide that he found the “loss of innocent lives … abhorrent”.

“There has been significant misunderstanding of my use of the word “brilliant”, he wrote on X. “The loss of innocent lives in any conflict is abhorrent & must be avoided. As a retired national security & intel leader, my use of that word was about the complexity & sophistication of an operation.”

Whether Wilcynski is prepared to admit it or not, the shadowy architects of Israel’s “complex” and “sophisticated” “operation” are guilty of killing Fatima and Bilal.

They bear responsibility. They are to blame. The killings should haunt their consciences since they will never be held to account. Instead, they may win medals and promotions. They will be praised by Wilcynski and callous company for their “service” and inventiveness.

Wilcynski’s hurried and self-serving clarification did not work.

On September 18, he took, once again, to a social media platform renowned for its seriousness of purpose, intelligence, and nuance, X, to announce his resignation.

“My posts on the Hezbollah/Israel war caused harm & affected my ability to help combat antisemitism at U of Ottawa. My intent in sharing is irrelevant when it is clear many were hurt by them. I apologize. I resigned as Special Advisor on Antisemitism,” hewrote.

Wilcynski’s posts that caused such “hurt” and “harm” remain, as of this writing, live on X.

Meanwhile, Fatima and Bilal have been buried. They will never graduate. They will never marry. They will never have families of their own to love.

And Fatima will never learn English.

Pagers,The history of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel,"The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel – which have been exchanging fire across the border of Israel and Lebanon since the start of the war on Gaza last October – has descended into “war”, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr has reported from Beirut.

Hezbollahconfirmedthat its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, had been killed in anIsraeli air strikeon residential buildings in Beirut, which Israel claimed were above Hezbollah’s headquarters, on the night of Friday, September 27. Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and other Hezbollah commanders, were also killed in the massive air attack on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh on Friday, the Israeli military claimed.

On Saturday, Israel’s military said jet fighters had also attacked “dozens” of Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley and various areas of southern Lebanon and the attacks are continuing.

The conflict has escalated severely since September 17, when some 2,800 people in Lebanon were injured when their pager devices exploded. At least nine people were killed, among them three children.

Most of the people injured in that attack were members of Hezbollah, which blamed the attack on Israel.

Hezbollah has been trading attacks across the southern Lebanese border with Israel for nearly a year, since October 8 when it began its attacks to deter Israel from its war on Gaza, which has killed at least 41,500 people.

Israel has returned fire, escalating and slowing in turn against one of the region’s most experienced nongovernmental fighting groups, which is well-armed and battle-tested against it.

The conflict between the two is not new, rather it goes back nearly half a century.

Here’s a timeline:

Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982, ostensibly in response to attacks launched on it by the Palestine Liberation Organization from southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s civil war had been raging for seven years by then.

Hoping to install a friendly government in Lebanon, Israel occupied the south and went as far as West Beirut, where the PLO was based, which it put under siege.

After an agreement, the PLO left for Tunisia but Israel’s military stayed in Lebanon, supporting local proxies in the civil war and contributing to the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Right-wing Lebanese militia, in coordination with the Israeli army, killed between 2,000 and 3,500 Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians in two days.

Several Lebanese groups formed to repel the invasion, one was from the Shia Muslim community, traditionally a quiet demographic.

Hezbollah was the brainchild of Muslim leaders, reportedly supported by Iran, and given the mandate of repelling Israel.

Drawing support from disaffected youth and residents of the Bekaa Valley and Beirut’s southern suburbs – marginalised areas with significant Shia populations – Hezbollah quickly became a significant power in Lebanon.

Between 1982 and 1986, a number of attacks against foreign military presences were executed and claimed by various groups, but many were blamed on Hezbollah.

On October 23, 1983, the bombing of several barracks buildings in the capital, Beirut, killed more than 300 French and American peacekeepers.

The bombing was claimed by the Islamic Jihad group, believed by many to be a front for Hezbollah.

By 1985, Hezbollah’s fighting power grew to the point that it, along with allied groups, was able to force the Israeli army to withdraw to the Litani River in south Lebanon.

Israel declared what it called a “security zone” along swaths of the Lebanese-Israeli border.

Policing that security zone was the Christian-dominated South Lebanon Army (SLA), typicallyreportedas an Israeli proxy force, which continued to support the occupation of south Lebanon until Israel’s withdrawal in 2000.

In 1992, after Lebanon’s civil war (1975-1992) ended, Hezbollah entered parliamentary politics, winning eight seats in Lebanon’s 128-seat assembly.

Hezbollah’s seats have increased and the group and its allies now have 62 seats in parliament.

It also runs extensive social programmes in areas where its presence is strongest, increasing its influence.

In July 1993, Israel attacked Lebanon in what it called “Operation Accountability”, known as the Seven-Day War in Lebanon.

The assault came after Hezbollah responded to Israeli attacks on a refugee camp and village in Lebanon by attacking northern Israel, causing casualties.

The conflict killed 118 Lebanese civilians and wounded 500 more, and destroyed thousands of buildings.







Three years later, on April 11, 1996, Israel launched another 17-day offensive intended to force Hezbollah beyond the Litani River and out of striking range of Israeli targets.

What the Lebanese call the April Aggression was called “Operation Grapes of Wrath” by Israel, referencing the 1939 novel by US author John Steinbeck.

There were significant military and civilian casualties on both sides and Lebanon’s infrastructure was badly damaged.

On April 18, Israel shelled a United Nations compound near the village of Qana in occupied southern Lebanon – some 800 displaced civilians were sheltering there.

The attack killed 106 civilians, including at least 37 children, and injured about 116.

Four Fijian soldiers, assigned to the UN interim peacekeeping force, were also seriously injured.

In a 2006 operation into Israeli territory, Hezbollah killed three Israeli soldiers, Wassim Nazal, Eyal Benin and Shani Turgeman, and captured two, Ehud “Udi” Goldwasser and Eldad Regev.

Hezbollah demanded the release of Lebanese prisoners in exchange for the Israeli soldiers. In the end, the bodies of both Goldwasser and Regev were returned two years later in exchange for five Lebanese prisoners.

Later the same month, the July War broke out, lasting 34 days.

Approximately 1,200 Lebanese people died and 4,400 were wounded, mostly civilians. Israel, meanwhile, reported 158 deaths, most of them soldiers.

In 2009, while maintaining its opposition to Israel and its continued support for Iran, Hezbollah updated its manifesto, committing to its integration into a democratic form of government that represented national unity rather than sectarian interests. This was its second declaration, after 1985’s Open Letter which had directly opposite domestic goals.

The 2009 manifesto doubled down on the idea of resistance against Israel while showing how entrenched Hezbollah was becoming in all layers of Lebanon.

Hezbollah entered Syria’s civil war in support of the Damascus regime from 2012, a move criticised by many of its former Arab supporters and also condemned by one of the group’s founders, senior cleric Subhi al-Tufayli.

However, their supporters claim this deployment played a role in preventing the encroachment of armed groups, particularly ISIL (ISIS), into Lebanon, as well as gaining Hezbollah extensive battlefield experience.

In October 2023, Hezbollah launched a rocket campaign on Israel in support of Gaza, which was being bombarded by Israel following a Hamas-led surprise attack on Israel that saw 1,139 people killed and some 250 taken captive. Israel returned fire.







In Lebanon, 97,000 people have been forced from their homes, with 566 people killed, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. At least 133 were civilians.

About 60,000 Israelis were evacuated from the border region of northern Israel. People on both sides have yet to return to their homes.

Israel has carried out strikes and assassinations in Lebanon and Syria, killing several senior Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

Hezbollah played a role in what was regarded as one of the most dangerous points of the conflict after Israel was blamed for striking Iran’s consular building in Damascus on April 1, 2024.

When Iran responded to Israel two weeks later, Hezbollah was prominent in its support of Tehran.

On July 28, 12 Syrian children and young adults were killed on a football field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an incident that kicked off an escalation.

Israel and Hezbollah denied responsibility for the incident but Israel cited the tragedy as the cause for the assassination of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in southern Beirut a few days later.

Shukr’s killing, as well as that of Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, within days, has left the region on high alert.

Hezbollah launched arocket attack in late Augustas the first stage of its response to Shukr’s assassination.

On September 17, 2024,thousands of hand-held pagersbelonging to Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon exploded.

So far, at least 11 people, including three civilians, have been killed as a result of the attack and approximately 2,750 have been wounded.

Hezbollah has confirmed it holds Israel responsible and has promised retaliation.

Pagers,Israeli air attack on Beirut kills 14 as cross-border fire intensifies,"Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health says at least 14 people have been killed and 66 wounded in anIsraeli air attackon a southern suburb of the capital, Beirut.

The National News Agency (NNA) reported that five children were among the casualties from Friday’s attack on a building in Jamous Street. The agency said an F-35 jet hit the residential area with two attacks.

The Israeli military said it has carried out a “targeted strike” in the Lebanese capital targeting top Hezbollah commanderIbrahim Aqiland other senior commanders of the Radwan special forces unit.

Hezbollah later confirmed that Aqil had been killed in the attack.

Aqil has a $7m bounty on his head from the United States over an alleged link to the deadly bombing of a US marines barracks in Lebanon in 1983, according to the US Department of State website.

The Israeli attack marks the second time in less than two months that Israel has targeted a leading Hezbollah military commander in Beirut.







In July, an Israeli air strike killedFuad Shukr, the group’s top military commander.

Friday’s strike hit the sprawling Dahiya district during rush hour as people were leaving work and children were heading home from school.

Local networks broadcast footage that showed a high-rise building flattened just kilometres from central Beirut. First responders combed through the rubble of at least two collapsed apartment buildings to search for missing people.

Health authorities said at least nine of the 66 wounded were in a critical condition.

Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the attack “proves again that the Israeli enemy does not value any human, legal or moral considerations”.

In a brief statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s goals were clear and its actions spoke for themselves.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who has said this week that Israel is launching a new phase of war on the northern border, posted on X: “The sequence of actions in the new phase will continue until our goal is achieved: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.”

For nearly a year, Hezbollah has engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces along the Lebanon-Israel border in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border have been forced to flee their homes due to the fighting.

Earlier on Friday, Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with about 170 rockets, a day after the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, promised to retaliate against Israel for two days ofsabotage attacksthat set off explosives in thousands of communications devices, killing at least 37 people and injuring nearly 3,000.

But Hezbollah said the rockets were in retaliation for Israeli attacks on villages and homes in southern Lebanon overnight.







Rami Khouri, a professor at the American University of Beirut, told Al Jazeera that Israel is on “a rampage”, emboldened by the unwavering US support to “do anything they want”.

He said an escalation in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah appears inevitable but added that he does not believe an all-out regional war to be imminent.

Khouri said Israel has long sought to defeat Hezbollah, which is better equipped than Hamas and has closer ties with Iran.

“The problem is it has tried this many times without success,” Khouri added.

Zein Basravi, reporting from Amman because Al Jazeera is banned in Israel by the government, said the army has put out warnings to the Israeli people after the attack, saying everything is on the table and to be prepared.

“There are now renewed calls for people to stay near bomb shelters,” he added.

The Lebanese group fired about 150 rockets before Israel’s attack on Beirut while about 20 were launched after the air strike.

Israel’s military said rockets came in multiple waves on Friday afternoon, targeting sites along the border with Lebanon.

The Israeli military said the barrage of rockets caused no injuries and rescue services were working to put out fires sparked by falling debris.

It listed the targeted areas as the occupied Golan Heights, the Upper Galilee region and the town of Safed.

Videos from northern Israel posted online showed rockets being intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome system as sirens were heard in the background.

The military said its air defences took down some of the rockets while others fell in open areas.

Pagers,"In Israel, some want war with Hezbollah, others are worried","As the people of Lebanoncome to terms with the attackson communication devices that killed and maimed many, the Israeli public seems divided between elation over the attacks and nervousness over potential repercussions.

In a region where nerves are at breaking point as Israel’s war on Gaza approaches a year, this escalation is the latest in a series of concerning developments.

In addition to killing at least 41,000 people in its war on a blockaded enclave, Israel has traded threatening repartee with Iran, bombed Yemen in retaliation for a Houthi drone attack, and traded fire near-constantly with Hezbollah throughout.

On Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon, thousands of communication devices belonging to Hezbollah exploded in what appeared to be a series of coordinated detonations across Lebanon and Syria.

At the time of writing, 32 people have been killed, including two children, and thousands injured, many maimed or permanently disfigured, as a result of the attacks.

The stakes are lost on few within Israel, sources said, where elation over the novelty and ingenuity of the attacks freely mixes with concern over their consequences.







Few regard the threat posed to Israel by Hezbollah to have been significantly reduced by the attacks.

Israel has been massing troops to the north – ostensibly in a bid to allow the return of 60,000 residents evacuated from there amidst the tit-for-tat attacks between Hezbollah and Israel.

“These were daring attacks,” Mitchell Barak, a pollster and former aide to senior Israeli political figures, said from Jerusalem.

“If they were carried out by Israel,” he said – referencing Israel’s tendency to not comment on such attacks – “they’ve reinforced our reputation as ‘start-up nation’, innovative, daring and imagination.”

Barak stressed that both the unique nature of the attack and the level of infiltration required to carry it out had embarrassed Hezbollah.

“This was big,” he said. “Bigger than anything we’ve seen throughout the war. Possibly even bigger than the preemptive strike on the Egyptian air force in 1967 [which started a war].”

“No place is safe for them now. They’re going to want to respond to that, but they may find out that a US-brokered ceasefire is their best bet, because who knows what surprise could be next,” he said, hinting more Israeli attacks may be to come.

While media reports suggest that the precise timing of the attack may not have been of Israel’s choosing, the detonations nevertheless appear to have occurred at a fortuitous moment for it.

On Wednesday, the Israeli military redeployed its 98th Paratroopers Division from Gaza to the border with Lebanon, augmenting the Northern Command, which, until 2000, had occupied parts of Lebanon.

Later that day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Israeli military chief Herzi Halevi and others issued statements suggesting thata war with Hezbollah may be inevitable.

“It’s not clear what’s going to happen,” Israeli analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg said.

“On the one hand, among the public, many people are still giddy from the movie-style nature of the attacks on Hezbollah, so there isn’t any great craving for war.

“On the other hand, this is Hezbollah. This is the Big Bad. The call to strike and strike while they’re weak – particularly among the right – is hard to avoid.”

To many,including many within Hezbollah itself, war appears almost inevitable.

Across the region, analysts talk of the need for Hezbollah to retaliate against the strikes.

However, despite maintaining a mostly steady exchange of fire with Israel during the course of the war on Gaza, Hezbollah’s leadership in Lebanon and allies in Iran have gone to pains to avoid escalating the conflict.

“Right now, there’s the most expensive game of chicken in the world taking place across the region,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said from Tel Aviv.

“Netanyahu would welcome a war, but he cannot let anyone think he started it,” he said.

“It’s always framed as a kind of inevitability; one that the Israeli leadership can’t be held responsible for.

“They’re creating their own self-fulfilling prophecy.

“There’s no strategy, no vision, nothing. They’re just working it out day by day and assuming war will follow,” Goldberg added.

For now, the explosions in Lebanon have not changed anything in the Israeli parliament’s discourse, said Ofer Cassif, a member of parliament in Israel, representing the left-wing Hadash coalition.

Little can be expected from parliament, which is paralysed between the extreme right and their opponents on the left.

“Politics and society in Israel are polarised,” Cassif said, explaining that the attacks in Lebanon were unlikely to change many opinions.

“There are those on the right – let’s call them what they are, fascists – who want a bloodbath, conquest and occupation.

“Opposing them are different forces who have been against the massacre in Gaza, calling for its ending and the release of the hostages. Between these two forces, the centre, as it were, vanishes,” he said.

“I don’t think these terrorist attacks will change anything,” he added, explaining that he was using that term for the detonations in Lebanon as he would any explosion in a public space.

“It’s very strange how they see the attacks here. People talk about the attacks in terms of Hezbollah’s command structure and the implications of this or that.

“Nobody in Israel seems to talk about the terror inflicted upon the people of Lebanon. I mean, can you imagine it?” Goldberg said in Tel Aviv.

“Some will see them as too little, too late, and those on the left, like me, will continue our struggle against the danger of yet another war that will only bring more destruction, death and agony to the region,” Cassif said.

Pagers,At least 45 killed in Israeli strike on suburb in Lebanon’s Beirut,"The death toll from anIsraeli air attackin Beirut’s southern suburbs has risen to 45 people, including three children and seven women, Lebanese authorities say.

“The number of dead has risen to 45 people,” Lebanon’s health ministry said on Sunday, updating an earlier toll of 38 from the Friday attack.

It said “work continues to remove the rubble for the third day in a row” and that DNA sampling would be used to determine the identities of some of the bodies.

The strike, whichwrecked two buildingsin the Lebanese capital’s Dahiya district during rush hour on Friday, also injured about 60 people.

The three children killed were aged four, six and 10, according to Abiad. Emergency personnel was still searching for 17 people under the rubble.

“[The rescue operation] could continue for another day or so,” Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari reported from Beirut.

“There is still a sense of shock and fear,” she added. “Many of the shops in this area are closed, there are very few people present as many have chosen to pack up and leave.”







Minister of Public Works and Transport Ali Hamieh told Al Jazeera Arabic that the bombing of a residential building constituted a “war crime” and that Israel was “dragging the region into a war”.

Israel’s military said it carried out a “targeted strike” against senior members of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Forces in the Beirut suburb. An Israeli military spokesperson said on Saturday that “at least 16 Hezbollah militants” were killed in the attack.

Hezbollah confirmed that two of its top commanders,Ibrahim Aqiland Ahmad Mahmoud Wahabi, along with 12 other members, were killed. In July, an Israeli air strike killedFuad Shukr, the group’s top military commander.

Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi said Lebanon had entered a “decisive” phase after the attack on the residential suburb, telling a news conference on Saturday that everything must be done to prevent further violations of Lebanese territory and avoid further deterioration of the security situation.

Friday’s air attack on the densely populated area followed explosions of thousands ofpagers and walkie-talkiesin Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, which was also blamed on Israel and killed at least 39 people while wounding close to 3,000 others.



Late on Saturday, Hezbollah said it launched dozens of rockets at the Ramat David air base, east of Haifa, in response to the killing of civilians in Lebanon. Sirens were activated across northern Israel.

If confirmed, the assault would be the farthest the group’s firings have reached inside Israel since the start of the ongoing clashes in October of last year.

The Israeli military said 10 rockets were launched form Lebanon and most were intercepted.

The Israeli military had said earlier in the day that dozens of its warplanes had been striking southern Lebanon “extensively”.

Hezbollah had also launched dozens of retaliatory rockets into northern Israel throughout Saturday.

For nearly a year after Israel attacked Gaza, Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon have traded crossborder fire with the Israeli army. But the exchanges have escalated since late August.

Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported that Israeli warplanes had launched “a large-scale air attack” on Saturday evening over southern Lebanon.

The Israeli military said about 90 rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanon and that it struck more than 400 rocket launchers in Lebanon. It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was killed or wounded in the back-and-forth attacks.

“This exchange is the most intense since the two sides started engaging in crossborder fire on October 8, a day after Israel began its latest war on Gaza,” Al Jazeera’s Jabbari reported from Beirut.

The Israeli army announced updated safety guidelines for areas north of Haifa, including caps on gatherings of 30 people in open spaces and 300 in enclosed spaces.

The Israeli attacks on Lebanon have serious implications for international law, said Ibrahim Fraihat, professor of international conflict resolution at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies.

“What we are seeing in Lebanon takes the disrespect of international humanitarian law to a [new] level,” Fraihat told Al Jazeera. “These violations are being normalised by the silence of the West.”

He warned that the escalation of tensions in Lebanon was bound to divert attention from Gaza, allowing for more human rights violations to take place there.

Nearly a year into itswar on Gaza, Israel believes it can deal serious damage to the Lebanese group by “doubling down”, according to Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Jordan.

“They think that forcing Hezbollah through monstering them with military strikes, in multiple areas, on multiple fronts, of varying ferocity, will force it to make some kind of tactical retreat,” he added.

Pagers,Israel kills Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut: What does this mean for Hezbollah?,"Hezbollah’s leader for the past 32 years,Hassan Nasrallah, has been killed in an Israeli air strike on Lebanon’s capital Beirut on Friday evening.

Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and other Hezbollah commanders were also killed in the massive air attack on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh, the Israeli military claimed.

Just more than a week ago, Israel also killed senior Hezbollah commanderIbrahim Aqilin Beirut. These events come just two months after Hamas’s political bureau chief,Ismail Haniyeh, was killed by Israel in Iran.

The deaths of Nasrallah and other leaders in these unprecedentedattacks on Lebanonand during the massdetonation of pagersand handheld radios belonging to Hezbollah commanders earlier this month have left the group facing a potential power vacuum.

Israel has claimed this as a huge victory, but observers fear an escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran, backs Hezbollah. So what will happen next?

Nasrallah, 64, became Hezbollah’s third secretary-general in 1992, after his predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi, was killed by Israeli missiles.

Hezbollah (Party of God in Arabic) is anIran-backed groupformed in 1982 to fight Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon. It finds most of its support among Shia Muslims.

Nasrallah reached the peak of his popularity in Lebanon and beyond in 2006 after a war with Israel. His speeches, which combined political and religious elements, also contributed to his widespread appeal.

Critics, however, have also viewed Nasrallah as a leader of a Shia party fighting for Iranian interests, particularly after he sent fighters to help crush a 2011 uprising in Syria against Iran’s ally, President Bashar al-Assad.

Since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, Nasrallah has given televised speeches extending support for Hamas, while Hezbollah has exchanged cross-border missiles with Israel. In hislast speech on September 19, he addressed the pager attacks in Lebanon.





Hezbollah’s seven-to-eight-member shura council is expected to convene to decide who will now lead the party.

Hashem Safieddine, head of Hezbollah’s executive council, is believed to be among the choices as the group’s new secretary-general.

As executive council head, Safieddine oversees Hezbollah’s political affairs. He also sits on the Jihad Council, which manages the group’s military operations, and is Nasrallah’s maternal cousin.

Following Israel’s recent pager explosions,Safieddine saidIsrael had initiated a “new confrontation” and the response to the attack would be a “special punishment”.

In a statement on Saturday, in which it confirmed the death of Nasrallah, Hezbollah said it would continue its military operation in support of Gaza and the defence of Lebanon.

It launched five rocket attacks into northern Israel following the announcement that Nasrallah had been killed, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Imran Khan, reporting from Marjayoun, Lebanon.

While Hezbollah has been hit hard in the short term, analysts say it is unlikely that the group will be badly affected in the long run as one leader can be replaced with another and the group maintains its vast military arsenal and strength.

Beirut is considered to be Hezbollah’s “weakest point” as it is also where Western embassies and people who are affiliated with Western intelligence agencies are, said Mohammad Marandi, ‏‏a professor at the University of Tehran. Overall, however, “Israel does not have the capability to defeat Hezbollah militarily”, Marandi told Al Jazeera.

Analysts say the group now faces strategic choices amid a temporary leadership vacuum rather than a full blow to its survival.

“Hezbollah is not going to disappear,” said Yezid Sayig, senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Programme. It will “exercise strategic patience” even if Iran does not sweep in to defend them now, he added.

Experts do believe, however, that Hezbollah has made other mistakes that have weakened it relative to Israel.

“The big mistake that Hezbollah has made is to allow the Iranians to use them too much as a proxy,” said Sultan Barakat, senior professor in public policy at Hamad Bin Khalifa University. “Hezbollah were very effective when they fought for the liberation of the Lebanese land – for their own people.”

For the last year, however, Iran has given them little agency around how to use weapons they were given, while the group has miscalculated how much violence Israel is willing to exert, not just on the people of Gaza, but on the Lebanese people as well, he told Al Jazeera.

At the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday – before the latest strikes – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had one main message when he told members: “We are winning.” Israel is claiming this devastating assault on Hezbollah as a major victory.

Experts largely agree that Israel will continue on the offensive.

“Israel views it has momentum on its side following Nasrallah’s death and would want to take maximum advantage of a leadership vacuum,” Ali Rizk, a security and policy analyst, told Al Jazeera on Saturday.

The perceived success of its assault on Hezbollah may also sway domestic public opinion in Netanyahu’s favour, according to Mohamad Elmasry at the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies.

“Israelis who were opposing Netanyahu were opposed to his failures in Gaza, not being able to eliminate Hamas and not being able to bring hostages home, but they were not an antiwar crowd,” Elmasry said.

However, Israel may not necessarily achieve its stated goals of eliminating resistance and creating calm. In the past, escalated attacks have worked against them by breeding more resistance and opposition to Israel, Elmasry told Al Jazeera.

A continued offensive would also require continued supply of American ammunition, according to Elijah Magnier a military analyst in Brussels. In his first statement after the assassination, United States President Joe Biden said Washington supported Israel’s military strikes against Hezbollah, and described Nasrallah’s killing as “justice” for hundreds of Americans he accused Hezbollah of killing.

While Nasrallah’s killing has added to fears of an Iranian response, experts say the country now faces an even more delicate balancing act between standing up to Israel and avoiding a spillover of war in the region.

“Iran will probably not opt for an all-out escalation,” said Rizk. He added that the country will likely continue its usual approach of “fighting via proxies, including allies in Iraq and Yemen” before entering into any direct confrontation with Israel.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian issued a statement on the killing of Nasrallah on Saturday, saying it “will only further strengthen the resistance”.

He added that the international community will not forget that the order for this “terrorist attack” was issued from New York, likely referring to Netanyahu’s presence at the UN General Assembly on Friday.

Pezeshkian also said the US cannot deny complicity in Nasrallah’s killing as it has continued to supply weapons and military aid to Israel since the war on Gaza began nearly one year ago.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-killed-what-does-this-mean-for-hezbollah,NEGATIVE,0.990506112575531
Pagers,UN General Assembly overwhelmingly calls for end of Israeli occupation,"The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has overwhelminglyadopted a resolutioncalling on Israel to end its illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories within a year, a move that Palestine hailed as “historic”.

The nonbinding measure passed a 124-14 vote on Wednesday, with 43 countries abstaining.



The UNGA demanded that “Israel brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which constitutes a wrongful act of a continuing character entailing its international responsibility, and do so no later than 12 months”.

It also called on Israel to make reparations to Palestinians for damages incurred by the occupation.

The UNGA, whose mission includes promoting “respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms”, includes every sovereign country in the world, so Wednesday’s vote underscores the depth of the international opposition to the Israeli occupation of Palestine.

The resolution backed anadvisory opinionby the International Court of Justice (ICJ) – the UN’s top court – which found that Israel’s presence in the Palestinian territories is unlawful and must end.

Thecourt ruledin July that Israel is abusing its status as an occupying power, stressing that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal.







The UNGA vote comes amid Israel’s devastatingwar on Gaza, which has killed more than 41,250 Palestinians. The ICJ has issued rulings ordering Israel to take steps to prevent genocide in Gaza and allow adequate humanitarian aid intothe territory.

The United States, which claims to pursue atwo-state solutionto the conflict, joined Israel in opposing the UNGA resolution on Wednesday – as did Czechia, Hungary, Argentina and several small Pacific island states.

The resolution was submitted by Palestine – a permanent observer state at the UN.

Palestinian Authority PresidentMahmoud Abbaswelcomed the resolution and urged countries across the world to take steps to pressure Israel to adhere to it.

“The international consensus over this resolution renews the hopes of our Palestinian people – who are facing a comprehensive aggression and genocide in Gaza and the West Bank, including Jerusalem – to achieve its aspirations of freedom and independence and establishing a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” Abbas said.

Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem inthe 1967 warand subsequently annexed the entire holy city in 1980.

International law prohibits the acquisition of land by force.

Israel has also been building settlements – now home to hundreds of thousands of Israelis – in the West Bank in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which bans the occupying power from transferring “parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”.







Most of the international community considers the occupation illegal.

But the US argues that Palestinians and Israelis should negotiate a resolution to the issues without external pressure – a standard that Washington does not apply to other conflicts, including the Russian occupation of parts of Ukraine.

Several US allies – including France, Finland and Mexico – voted in favour of Wednesday’s resolution. The United Kingdom, Ukraineand Canadaabstained.

Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, an advocacy group, slammed the abstention as “a cowardly refusal to stand up for international law and Palestinian freedom”.

“All states are obliged to help bring an end to Israel’s illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories as soon as possible, but Canada just abstained,” the group said in a social media post.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/un-general-assembly-overwhelmingly-calls-for-end-of-israeli-occupation,POSITIVE,0.8586207628250122

Pagers,Israel intensifies air raids on southern Lebanon amid escalation fears,"Israel has intensified attacks on southern Lebanon, launching dozens of air raids amid fears of a wider escalation in the region.

Israeli warplanes targeted the towns of Mahmoudieh, Ksar al-Aroush and Birket Jabbour in the Jezzine area on Thursday, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported.

Three unnamed Lebanese security sources told the news agency Reuters it was some of the most intense bombing since the start of the war in Gaza in October when Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah started trading cross-border fire.

The Israeli military said its air force struck approximately 100 rocket-launchers, as well as other infrastructure. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties.

In a Thursday briefing, the Israeli defence minister said Hezbollah would “pay an increasing price” as Israel seeks to make conditions near its border with Lebanon safe enough for residents who have fled the cross-border attacks to return.

“The sequence of our military actions will continue,” Yoav Gallant said.

In a speech earlier on Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said thepager and walkie-talkie attacksagainst its members in Lebanon and Syria this week crossed “all red lines” and the group would retaliate.

In recent weeks, Israeli leaders have stepped up warnings of a potential larger military operation against Hezbollah, saying they are determined to stop the group’s fire to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to homes near the border.







In his firstspeechsince the device attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, Nasrallah acknowledged that Hezbollah had suffered an “unprecedented” blow from the blasts, which killed 37 people and wounded nearly 3,000 over two days. Nasrallah said Hezbollah would continue operations against Israel “until the aggression on Gaza stops”.

Hamas said it “highly appreciates” Hezbollah’s support and Nasrallah’s stance frustrated Israel’s “plans to undermine the support front of our people and resistance in the Gaza Strip”.

Israel has not commented on thedevice explosions.

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas would “lower the temperature” in the region but also said the US was “unwavering” against any Iran-backed threats.

A preliminary investigation by the Lebanese authorities found the devices were implanted with explosives before arriving in the country, according to a letter by the Lebanese mission to the United Nations that was seen by Reuters.

The authorities also determined the devices, which included pagers and handheld radios, were detonated via electronic messages, according to the letter sent to the UN Security Council.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a mostly low-level conflict since Israel launched an assault on Gaza on October 7, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.

In late July, Israel killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut, and hours later, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran, triggering fears of an escalation.

Pagers,US senator to Arab American advocate: ‘You should hide your head in a bag’,"Washington, DC –A US senator has launched ad hominem attacks against a prominent Arab American community advocate during a congressional hearing intohate crimesin the United States, which have surged in the shadow of Israel’s war on Gaza.

The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday aimed to address the rise of hate crimes in the country.

But several Republicans dedicated their time to bashingcollege studentswho have protested for Palestinian rights amid the Gaza war, and many took aim at the event’s sole Arab American witness – Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute.

“You support Hamas, do you not?” Louisiana Republican John Kennedy asked Berry.

She unambiguously said “no” as she tried to refocus the conversation on the domestic issue of hate crimes, rather than foreign policy.

“I’m going to say thank you for that question because it demonstrates the purpose of our hearing today,” Berry told the senator, suggesting that it effectively shows the rise in hate and dehumanisation she has been decrying.

But Kennedy would not drop his line of questioning. “You support Hezbollah too, don’t you?” he asked, referring to the Lebanese armed group.

Again, Berry responded by calling the question “disappointing”.







The senator went on to grill Berry over her opposition to a decision by the US Congress tocut fundingto the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which she had called “an incredible moral failure”.

When Berry defended her support for UNRWA, which provides vital services – including healthcare and education – to millions of Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, Kennedy asked her one more time whether she supports Hamas.

Although Berry had clearly said she does not support Hamas or Hezbollah, Kennedy said the witness could not bring herself to say that she did not back the groups.

“You should hide your head in a bag,” he told Berry.

Advocacy groups say the US has seen an uptick in hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims since the start of the war on Gaza last year.

In the Chicago area, a six-year-old Palestinian American boy wasfatally stabbedby a neighbour in a hate-motivated attack in October.

Three college students wearing keffiyehswere shotin Vermont in November, leaving one of them paralysed from the chest down.

But Republicans on the Judiciary Committee seemed incensed that Tuesday’s hearing was about all hate crimes, not focused solely on the anti-Semitism that Israel’s advocates say Jewish students are suffering on college campuses due to Palestinianrights activism.

Demonstrationsand encampments sprung up on dozens of US university campuses earlier this year, with students urging their colleges to divest from Israel amid the offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 41,250 Palestinians.







Israel’s supporters have accused the campus protests of endangering the safety of Jewish students – a charge that activists vehemently deny.

They have stressed that their goal is to end their universities’ complicity in what they describe as a genocide against Palestinians.

Pagers,"Who was Ibrahim Aqil, the Hezbollah commander targeted by Israel?","Israel has hit a residential area in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut in an attempted assassination ofsenior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil.

Hezbollah confirmed Aqil was killed on Friday, hours after the Israeli military said it had “eliminated” him in the attack on the Dahiyeh area.

The attack killed at least 14 people and wounded 66 others, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said, in a preliminary toll.

Aqil, a senior leader in Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force with a $7m reward on his head from the US Department of State, was reportedly in a joint meeting between Hezbollah and an unnamed Palestinian group when the Israeli attack levelled at least two buildings.

Witness footage showed piles of grey rubble where one building once stood and thick dust spilling into the street and covering parked cars, as Lebanese Civil Defence forces dug in search of survivors.

The attack inflicted another blow on Hezbollah after the group suffered an unprecedented attack earlier this week in which pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded, killing 37 people and wounding thousands.

It marked the second time in less than two months that Israel has targeted a leading Hezbollah military commander in Beirut. In July, an Israeli air strike killedFuad Shukr, the group’s top military commander.

Killing Aqil, second-in-command of Hezbollah’s armed forces, would be another major blow to the group.

Aqil joined Hezbollah in the 1980s, and was responsible for the group’s attacks outside of Lebanon, according to the Israeli military.

Like most senior Hezbollah military officials, Aqil has been a shadowy figure, making no public appearances or statements.

According to US officials, Aqil, also known as Tahsin, served on Hezbollah’s highest military body.

He waswantedin the US in connection to his role in the 1983 bombings of the US Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, and of the US Marine Corps barracks, which killed 241 US personnel.

The attacks were claimed by the Islamic Jihad Organization, a Hezbollah cell, of which Aqil was a senior member.

Aqil also directed the taking of American and German captives in the 1980s, according to US officials.

The Radwan Force are at the forefront of Hezbollah’s cross-border fighting with Israel.

Aqil was injured during the pagers explosions on Tuesday and was discharged from the hospital earlier on Friday, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/20/who-is-ibrahim-aqil-the-hezbollah-commander-targeted-by-israel,NEGATIVE,0.9707186818122864
Pagers,US Election 2024,"CNN has banned a conservative commentator after he verbally attacked British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan by referring to a series ofexploding handheld devicesin Lebanon that targeted Hezbollah.

“I hope your beeper doesn’t go off,” Ryan James Girdusky said during a heated debate with Hasan, a prominent broadcaster and outspoken critic ofIsrael’s war on Gaza, on the show CNN Newsnight with host Abby Phillip on Monday.

In a statement, the network said: “There is zero room for racism or bigotry at CNN or on our air.”

Nearly 40 people were killed and thousands wounded in two days ofunprecedented attacksin September when pagers, walkie-talkies and other handheld communication devices exploded across Lebanon, which were blamed on Israel.

Guests on CNN Newsnight were debating the upcoming United States presidential election and thecontroversial Madison Square Garden rallyof Republican candidate Donald Trump, including remarks made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe about Puerto Rico.

Hasan, founder of new media company Zeteo, criticised the rhetoric at the rally during which several speakers, including Trump, made racist and sexist comments aimed at several minority groups, including Black Americans, Latinos and Jews.

At one point, Hasan acknowledged that the accusation that Trump and his supporters are Nazis is “inflammatory”.

“But if you don’t want to be called Nazis, stop doing, stop saying,” Hasan said before he was interrupted and talked over by Girdusky, who went on to note that Hasan himself was called an “anti-Semite more than anyone at this table”.

“I am in support of the Palestinians, so I am used to it,” Hasan said.

Girdusky then replied, “I hope your beeper doesn’t go off”, in an apparent reference to themass attacks in Lebanon.

“Did you just say I should die? Did you just say I should be killed?” Hasan responded.







Phillip, the host, chastised Girdusky and apologised to Hasan following a commercial break while noting that Girdusky had been removed from the panel of guests.

“There is a line that was crossed there, and it’s not acceptable to me,” Phillip said.

CNN also said in its statement, “We aim to foster thoughtful conversations and debate including between people who profoundly disagree with each other in order to explore important issues and promote mutual understanding.”

Pagers,Lebanon’s Hezbollah fires missile at Mossad HQ near Israel’s Tel Aviv,"Hezbollahhas fireda ballistic missile targeting Mossad’s headquarters near Tel Aviv, the Lebanon-based group said.

Warning sirens sounded in Tel Aviv on Wednesday as a surface-to-surface missile was intercepted by Israeli air defence systems after it was detectedcrossing from Lebanon, the Israeli military said.

Hezbollah said that the building targeted was where the Israeli intelligence agency planned the recentattacksusing pagers and other wireless devices. The launch came amid Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon, which has killed at least 500 people and forced tens of thousands to flee.

It is the first time that the Iran-backed armed group has claimed a ballistic missile strike since October when hostilities with Israel were triggered by the war on Gaza.

“The Islamic Resistance launched a ‘Qader 1’ ballistic missile at 6:30am (03:30 GMT) on Wednesday, 25-9-2024, targeting the Mossad headquarters in the outskirts of Tel Aviv,” Hezbollah said in a statement. “This headquarters is responsible for the assassination of leaders and the explosion of pagers and wireless devices.”

The group added that the strike was carried out in support of the people of Gaza and “in defence of Lebanon and its people”.

The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel.

Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation from the Israeli side.

There were no reports of damage or casualties in Israel and the military said there was no change to civil defence instructions for central Israel.

The Israeli Air Force said in a post on X that its planes had struck the launcher from which the missile was fired in the area of Nafakhiyeh in Lebanon.







The Israeli army reported on Wednesday that Hezbollah had also launched attacks on the occupied Syrian region of Golan Heights and near Mount Carmel in northern Israel.

It added that the defence systems intercepted rocket and unmanned air vehicle attacks in the morning.

Reporting from Marjayoun in Lebanon, Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said that it appears that Hezbollah has ramped up its firing of rockets at Israel.

He suggested that the missile fired at Tel Aviv was meant as a “message”.

“It’s only one missile, so it’s more than likely to be a message from Hezbollah that they still have ballistic missile capability,” Khan reported.

“The Israeli army says that their missile defence system intercepted it. The fear for the Israelis is that the missile defence system simply gets overwhelmed.”

Meanwhile, Israel continued overnight and into Wednesday to pound Lebanon.

The Israeli military said it conducted a series of air strikes in four waves, one of the largest campaigns in its history, with 250 fighter jets dropping 2,000 munitions.

Israel’s war on Gaza has drawn in Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups from across the Middle East.

The shift of Israel’s focus from Gaza to Lebanon in recent days has revived fears that a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah could erupt, or even a conflagration stretching across the region.

Pagers,US approves $567m in military support for Taiwan,"United States President Joe Biden has approved $567m in new defence support for Taiwan, the White House has said.

In a brief statement on Sunday, the White House said Biden had delegated the secretary of state “to direct the drawdown of up to $567 million in defense articles and services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training, to provide assistance to Taiwan”.

It provided no further details.

While the US does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it is Taipei’s most significant international backer and arms supplier. China has repeatedly demanded Washington stop selling weapons to Taipei, which it claims as its territory.

InApril, the US approved billions of dollars in military aid for Taiwan as China stepped up military and political pressure on the island. Beijing accuses Washington of meddling in its “internal affairs” with its support for the democratic island.

Taipei has complained of delayed US arms deliveries, including for upgraded F-14 fighter jets.

Pagers,Why is Israel attacking Lebanon?,"Over the last 24 hours, Israel has unleasheda series of air strikesacross Lebanon.

Hundreds of Lebanese people are dead, many are wounded and thousands are displaced as they scramble to try to figure out safe areas to get their families to.

Calling this part of its “new phase” of the war on Gaza, the Israeli army said it struckmore than 1,000 targetsin Lebanon – claiming they were Hezbollah strongholds or military facilities placed in people’s homes.

Israel has just killed at least 558 Lebanese people.

Among the dead are 50 children and 94 women, while about 2,000 people were wounded, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health said.

More than 10,000 people have been forced from their homes in the most ferocious onslaught Lebanon has experienced since its civil war of 1975-1990.

The first Israeli strikes on Lebanon were reported on Monday at 6:30am, hitting anuninhabited area near Byblos, north of Beirut.

More than 1,300 strikes on what Israel claimed were Hezbollah military targets followed. The attacks are ongoing.

Satellite mapping of the strikes by Al Jazeera shows attacks across Lebanon, with the highest concentration in the south and the Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah’s influence is considered strongest.

Before the attacks, some 80,000 phone calls from the Israeli army to Lebanese people – predominantly in the south – were reported, urging them to evacuate their homes and find “safety”.

The result was panic, chaos and bottlenecks, with the main coastal road to the capital, Beirut, gridlocked for several kilometres as residents tried to flee an impending attack.

Israel says it is attacking Hezbollah so it can return its displaced citizens to the north.

On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced the redeployment of “forces, resources and energy” towards the north and Hezbollah as the war entered a “new phase”, seeming to imply the war on Gaza was winding down.







According to Gallant, this was part of a bid to return the 65,000 Israelis he had ordered evacuated in the early days of the conflict in anticipation of Hezbollah attacks on their homes near Lebanon’s border.

That big Hezbollah attack never happened but Israel and Hezbollah have been maintaining a steady exchange of fire over Lebanon’s southern border since October 2023.

Hezbollah has promised to keep up its attacks until Israel reaches a ceasefire agreement with the group’s ally Hamas in Gaza.

In anews conference on Monday night, Israel’s military spokesperson did not rule out a land invasion of Lebanon, saying: “We will do whatever is necessary to bring back home all our citizens to the northern border safely.”

It appears so.

On September 17, a day before Gallant’s “new phase” announcement, hundreds of pagers belonging to Hezbollah members were detonated in an attack widely believed to have been undertaken by Israel.

Israel did not comment.

The following day, another attack hit Hezbollah’s walkie-talkie radios. The two attacks killed 37 people, including two children, and wounded and maimed thousands more.

The attacks compromised the group’s communications and, according to analysts, undermined its morale.

Exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah have escalated since, with a devastating Israeli strike in southern Beirut on Saturdaykilling 45peopleand wounding many more.

Very.

Israel and Hezbollah’s alliances could pull other countries in.

Israel’s ally, the United States, announced it was deploying additional troops to the area, without specifying how many and for what purpose. The US currently has about 40,000 troops in the region.

Hezbollah and Iran have worked in tandem since Hezbollah’s founding as a response to Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982.

Israel has pitched its battles with groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of a wider battle against Iran.

Israel, while it has never admitted to having nuclear weapons, is estimated to have an arsenal of 90 nuclear warheads.

Iran, while not yet nuclear-armed, is considered to be close to it after an agreement to limit the country’s nuclear programme was dissolved by former US President Donald Trump in 2018.

Regardless, Iran has one of the region’s largest and most powerful militaries as well as a network of alliances with groups including Yemen’s Houthis and Gaza’s Hamas.

Both the US and Iran have repeatedly shown themselves to be aware of the risks any escalation might pose.

Despite Israeli provocations – such as the April 2024 air strike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, and the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July – Iran’s response to Israel has so far been tepid.

Retaliation to the April air strike was telegraphed long in advance and was mostly intercepted. No response to Haniyeh’s killing has been forthcoming.

The US, despite its unflagging support for Israel, has also shown itself to be aware of the risks of escalation.

US diplomats continue to facilitate indirect talks between Hamas and Israel to reach a ceasefire, with Biden evenannouncing a ceasefire deal in May, which at the time he attributed to Israel.

However, it wassubsequently rejected.

For many in Israel, after decades of tension, war with Hezbollah is inevitable.

As the war on Gaza rumbles on and the death toll there soars past 41,455, many have accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging and escalating the conflict for his political ends.

Groups representing the families of those taken captive by Hamas on October 7 have accused the PM of derailing ceasefire talks – concerns echoed even by Biden, in June.

“Right now, there’s the most expensive game of chicken in the world taking place across the region,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said from Tel Aviv, speaking before the latest attack.

“It’s always framed as a kind of inevitability, one that the Israeli leadership can’t be held responsible for. They’re creating their own self-fulfilling prophecy.”

Pagers,At least 38 people killed in dozens of Israeli strikes on eastern Lebanon,"At least 38 people have been killed in multiple attacks around Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley as Israel ramps up strikes on eastern Lebanon, according to the regional governor.

Bachir Khodr, governor of the Baalbek Hermel governorate, said on Wednesday that about 40 Israeli strikes on the province killed 38 people and injured 54 others.

Meanwhile, at dusk, more Israeli strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs. This came after the Israeli army issued forced evacuation warnings for three areas in southern Lebanon.

Israeli military spokesperson said on X that residents in the southern suburbs of Burj al-Barajneh, Laylaki and Haret Hreik must leave, adding, “You are located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah, against which the [military] will act in the near future.”

An hour after the warnings, there were at least four Israeli strikes in the area. There was no immediate report on possible casualties and what was targeted.

For the past year, Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah have been exchanging tit-for-tat attacks. The fighting intensified in late September following adeadly attack on pagersin Lebanon, and Israel began a limited ground operation into Lebanese border villages.

Wednesday’s attacks on Lebanon came after Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Naim Qassem said he did not think “political action” would end the war.

“When the enemy decides to stop the aggression, there is a path for negotiations that we have clearly defined – indirect negotiations through the Lebanese state and Speaker [of parliament Nabih] Berri,” said Qassem in a recorded address marking 40 days since his predecessor,Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in a strike.

“We have tens of thousands of trained resistance combatants,” the Hezbollah chief added.

Meanwhile, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Wednesday that Israel’s attacks on Lebanon were becoming “crimes against humanity”.

Mikati told Lebanon’s cabinet that Israel was obstructing international efforts to end the fighting and that he held the international community responsible for Israel’s “relentless war” against his people.

Speaker of the House Berri met United States and Saudi ambassadors in Lebanon on Wednesday to discuss political developments, his office said without elaborating on details.

US efforts to stop the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which included a 60-day ceasefire proposal, lost momentum last week in the run-up to the US election, in which former President Donald Trump wasre-elected.

According to the Israeli army, since Wednesday morning, 120 rockets have been fired from Lebanon to Israel.

Earlier in the day, Hezbollah said it targeted a military base near Israel’s main airport near Tel Aviv. The Israel Airports Authority said the attack did not disrupt operations.

Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said that since the fighting began last year, more than 3,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, with the majority occurring in the past six weeks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/6/at-least-38-people-killed-in-dozens-of-israeli-strikes-on-eastern-lebanon,NEGATIVE,0.9929670095443726
Pagers,"Hezbollah has been dealt a heavy blow, but it can still win against Israel","With the assassination of Hezbollah’s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, on September 28, Israel has brought the ongoing conflict to a critical juncture. The killing, which involved the dropping of dozens of 2,000-pound bombs on the densely-populated southern suburbs of Beirut, came on the tail of a violent aerial campaign that killed more than 500 people in the span of 24 hours. That was preceded by unprecedented attacks on Hezbollah’s rank and file using booby-trapped pagers and other communication devices.

All of this has provided Israel with a significant tactical advantage. If sustained alongside other tactical operations, these efforts could weaken Hezbollah’s ability to respond effectively. The attacks have dealt a major blow to the chain of command of the Radwan Force, which has not yet been deployed in this conflict, and whose involvement is contingent upon the appointment of new commanders as well as the strategic progression of the war. The assassination of Ali Karaki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, although of symbolic significance, does not appear to affect Hezbollah’s capacity to continue expanding the range of fire on Israeli cities.









Israel’s ultimate goal with these attacks is to decouple its war on Gaza from the conflict in Lebanon – that is to force Hezbollah to stop supporting Hamas by attacking northern Israel. The Israeli government is using escalation as a means to achieve this goal. A successful decoupling, the Israelis believe, would create a rift among the members of the axis of resistance, which Hamas and Hezbollah are both part of.

But there is a risk that this Israeli approach will backfire. Israel may, in fact, find itself in a situation similar to 2006, when it was the stronger side but still lost its confrontation with Hezbollah due to the paradox of escalation. This is because, in asymmetric war, relatively weaker entities can win by simply employing strategic patience, prolonging the war and forcing their stronger opponent to expend significant resources, ultimately depleting them.

It is important to point out that Hezbollah cannot back down from this confrontation, even at a heavy cost in terms of its leaders’ lives. The stakes are extremely high; if it were to retreat, it would not only lose the trust and confidence of its supporters, but it could also jeopardise the strategic deterrence it has built since the 2006 war with Israel. That is why, the surviving Hezbollah leadership is likely to fight to the end.

In the present case, all Hezbollah has to do is mobilise its remaining capabilities to continue its rocket attacks on northern Israel, which will prevent the Israeli army from securing the return of evacuated residents, and resist Israeli attempts to push its forces north of the Litani River through a ground offensive.

Even if the Israeli army does not face fierce resistance, whatever advances it makes in the “limited ground operation” it just declared may be temporary. It would, therefore, face the choice of whether to expand the operation or not.

Hezbollah continues to respond to Israel’s escalation with a restrained approach, hoping to provoke it into initiating a full-scale invasion. For Hezbollah, an escalation into ground warfare offers considerable tactical advantages.

The presence of Israeli ground troops would limit the effectiveness of Israel’s air force. For example, the F-35 would not be used in areas where Israeli troops are clashing with Hezbollah due to the risk of Israeli soldiers dying in such bombardment. Other tactical aircraft may also have limited use, as Hezbollah may be equipped with anti-aircraft missiles.

Additionally, Hezbollah’s forces are more familiar with the challenging terrain of southern Lebanon, giving them a major advantage. Over the years, Hezbollah has also developed a robust logistical and military infrastructure designed to support prolonged ground warfare in this area.

Furthermore, for Hezbollah, fighting Israeli troops on the ground offers an opportunity to further solidify its image as a resistance group among the Arab public – an image that was relatively eroded due to its involvement in the Syrian civil war.

An open long confrontation with Israel would reposition Hezbollah as the leading resistance faction in the Arab world, bolstering its image as a staunch defender of Palestinian and Arab interests. This renewed standing would likely enhance its influence across the region and could strengthen its ability to recruit volunteers and gain support from Arab and Muslim communities.

Israel will likely try to avoid engaging in a prolonged, open confrontation that requires redeployment of its troops deep across the border into Lebanon. High personnel losses could lead to mounting pressure on the Israeli government to pull out, presenting Hezbollah with a victory.

However, the current Israeli strategy of intense bombardment to force Hezbollah to accept a ceasefire on Israeli terms has its limits. While the current US administration is readily replenishing Israel’s depleted arms and ammunition stocks, it is doing so at an ever-increasing cost.

Although the US establishment remains in full support of Israel, a significant segment of American voters on both sides of the political spectrum opposes this support for ethical and economic reasons. Whoever gets elected in the US presidential election will likely feel compelled to put an end to Israel’s endless escalation, possibly by threatening to cut weapons supplies. That is why, Israel is in a hurry to establish new facts on the ground in the region before the elections.

On the other hand, for Hezbollah and other resistance movements, this is fundamentally a war of attrition that will continue, even if Israel manages to achieve some early successes. Although Hezbollah has faced considerable losses over the past two weeks, it still has the potential to declare another victory over Israel. Similar to Hamas in Gaza, survival alone can be considered a success. These are likely the calculations being made in Beirut, as well as by its strategic supporters in Tehran.

In the end, Israel’s attempts to create a rift within the axis of resistance may have the opposite effect. Recent history suggests that instead of causing division, the escalation of Israeli operations bolsters public support for the resistance while also reinforcing the unity among its members in Lebanon, Palestine, and beyond.

Pagers,Lebanon’s Hezbollah says senior leader killed amid Israeli bombardment,"Lebanon’s armed group Hezbollah has announced the death of one of its top commanders amidIsrael’s intense bombardment of the country.

Hezbollah confirmed that Ibrahim Muhammad Qubaisi had been killed in a post on Telegram early on Wednesday, hours after the Israeli military said he had been “eliminated” in an air strike on Ghobeiri in Beirut’s southern suburbs.

Israeli officials said that Qubaisi, also known as “Hajj Abu Musa”, led a number of Hezbollah’s missile and rocket units and had been responsible for a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed.

Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said that the Israeli strike had killed six people and injured 15 others.

Israeli attacks since Monday have killed at least 569 people and wounded 1,835 others in Lebanon, according to Lebanese health authorities.

“It’s a very tense atmosphere, a lot of people are very worried,” said Al Jazeera’s Oliver Marsden, reporting from Beirut.

“You also have the tens of thousands of Lebanese people fleeing from the south, heading north, here to Beirut.”







The escalation of fightingacross the Israeli-Lebanese border, which has seen low-level skirmishes since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October, follows last week’s mass detonation of pagers and walkie-talkies targeting Hezbollah members in Lebanon.

Hezbollah has launched hundreds of rockets into Israel in recent days, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s anti-missile defences.

The Lebanese group fired about 300 rockets towards Israel on Tuesday, injuring six civilians and soldiers, according to the Israeli military.

Israel’s bombing campaign has forced thousands of people to flee southern Lebanon and raised fears of a new all-out conflict in the Middle East just as Israel’s war in Gaza is approaching the one-year mark.

The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the escalating conflict.

On Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Lebanon was “at the brink”.

“We should all be alarmed by the escalation. Lebanon is at the brink.

Pagers,Israel and Hezbollah trade intense fire as thousands flee south Lebanon,"Israel and Hezbollahtraded heavy firea day after the Israeli military launched a wave of air strikes across Lebanon that have killed at least 569 people so far, fanning fears of an all-out war.

Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad said on Tuesday that the revised number of deaths since strikes began on Monday morning included 50 children and 94 women, with 1,835 wounded.

Earlier the health ministry had reported that at least six people were killed and 15 wounded in an Israeli strikeon the southern Beirut suburbof Ghobeiry on Tuesday.

The Israeli military, which reportedly hit a five-storey building in the usually busy neighbourhood, announcedthe targeted strike– the second in the area in as many days – and said it was targeting a Hezbollah commander.

Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon reported on Tuesday that “two beloved members of the UNHCR family in Lebanon” had been killed the previous day.

The UNHCR identified them as staffer Dina Darwiche, who was killed with her young son in attacks on the Bekaa region, and contract cleaner Ali Basma, killed in an attack on Ain Baal municipality in south Lebanon.

“[The] UNHCR is outraged by the killing of our colleagues, and we extend our deepest sympathies to their families and loved ones,” the agency said.

Hezbollah said on Tuesday that it launched a barrage of rockets at Israeli air bases, including the Megiddo airfield near northern Afula, and at an explosives factory about 60km (37 miles) into Israel.

Later, the armed group reported that it had twice targeted the Dado military base in northern Israel with a total of 90 rockets and attacked the Atlit naval base south of Haifa with drones, among other targets.

The Israeli military said sirens sounded in the early evening in the northern city of Safed, where Dado is located, and nearby areas. It did not say whether the base was hit.

Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters that Hezbollah fired approximately 300 rockets at Israel on Tuesday.

The Israeli military said the airforce conducted “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and dozens of launchers that were aimed at Israeli territory.

The new strikes came after Israel said it launched more than 1,600 projectiles into Lebanon on Monday, first hitting areas in the south of the country and then expanding its bombardment to the Bekaa Valley in the east and the capital Beirut, in what is the largest flare-up of violence since the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.

Lebanese environment minister Nasser Yassin said 27,000 people were registered as displaced by the bombing campaign launched by Israel on Monday.







The strikes have drawn global condemnation andcalls for de-escalationas world leaders meet in New York for theUnited Nations General Assembly.

Tens of thousands of people were forced from their homes on Monday and overnight “and the numbers continue to grow”, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Matthew Saltmarsh told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday, adding that “the toll on civilians is unacceptable”.

As people escaped the south of the country towards Beirut, highways were gridlocked through the night.

Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from two schools turned into shelters in Beirut, said the facility could house about 120 families, but more displaced people were streaming in.

The caretakers “said that people have been coming here in a state of shock – they are confused, they are angry, they are worried and they are not sure how they will get by tomorrow”.

Nearly 150 schools have been allocated to be turned into shelters by the government.

Families with children were not only coming in from southern Lebanon, but also from a southern suburb of Beirut that was attacked twice by Israel, leaving many “internally displaced even within the capital”, Jabbari said.

Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Civil Defence tackled 176 fires caused by the Israeli strikes. It said it responded to blazes in agricultural land in Harf Miziara and Qartaba and in a landfill in Mashha, among others.

Minister of Health Firass Abiad said the Israeli air strikestargeted medical centres, ambulances and the cars of people trying to escape. The attack sent shock waves through the country and beyond.

More than 30 international flights to and from Beirut were cancelled, according to the Rafic Hariri International Airport’s website.

Qatar Airways said it has suspended flights to and from Beirut until Wednesday. Germany’s Lufthansa, Air France and Delta Air Lines of the United States have also suspended flights to Beirut in recent days, with some carriers’ services to Israel and Iran also affected.



The near-daily, cross-border fighting between the Israeli military and the Lebanese armed group since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October has displaced tens of thousands of residents on both sides.

The fighting escalated after thousands ofpagers and walkie-talkies explodedacross Lebanon last week in attacks also blamed on Israel. Close to 40 people were killed and nearly 3,000 maimed and injured, including women and children, in those explosions. Israel has neither denied the attack nor claimed responsibility for it.

On Friday, Israel struck Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing 59 people including Hezbollah’s second-in-command of the group’s armed wing,Ibrahim Aqil.

The Israeli military’s Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has said the army will “accelerate offensive actions today [Tuesday] and reinforce all units”, The Jerusalem Post reported.

“We must not give Hezbollah a break,” Halevi was quoted as saying at a situational assessment, according to the newspaper.

Pagers,UN warns escalating Israel-Hezbollah violence risks devastating conflict,"A senior United Nations official has told the Security Council that further violence between Israel and Iran-aligned groups Hamas in Gaza andHezbollah in Lebanonrisked igniting a far more damaging conflict.

“We risk seeing a conflagration that could dwarf even the devastation and suffering witnessed so far,” UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the 15-member council on Friday, which met about attacks this week on Hezbollah.

“It is not too late to avoid such folly. There is still room for diplomacy,” she said. “I also strongly urge member states with influence over the parties to leverage it now.”

As its war in Gaza nears one year old, Israel killed at least 14 people and wounded 66 in anair raid on the Lebanese capital Beiruton Friday.

The Israeli military claimed that atop Hezbollah commanderand other senior figures in the Lebanese movement were among the dead, and pledged to conduct a new military campaign until it secures the area around the Lebanese border.

Hezbollah has not confirmed the deaths of any commanders on Friday.

Israel’s air raid followedtwo days of attacksin which Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies exploded, killing 37 people and wounding thousands. Those attacks were widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.







On Friday, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told the Security Council that the attack on Hezbollah communications devices violated international law and could constitute a war crime.

Turk said it was “difficult to conceive” how the attacks on Hezbollah’s communications devices “could possibly conform with the key principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions in attack, under international humanitarian law”.

He added that he was “appalled” by the attacks using communication devices.

“This has unleashed widespread fear, panic and horror among people in Lebanon, already suffering in an increasingly volatile situation since October 2023 and crumbling under a severe and longstanding economic crisis. This cannot be the new normal,” he said.

Turk called for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation and for those who ordered and carried out the attacks to be held to account.

Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told the council that the US expects all parties to comply with international humanitarian law and take all reasonable steps to minimise harm to civilians, especially in densely populated areas.

“It is imperative that even as facts emerge about the latest incidents – in which I reiterate, the United States played no role – all parties refrain from any actions which could plunge the region into a devastating war.”

Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border since Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel in October in support of Gaza, where Israel is waging a devastating war that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.

Pagers,"What’s happening between Israel, Hezbollah as war on Gaza nears one year?","A longstanding, simmering conflict between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah is escalating.

Overnight on Sunday, exchanges following devastating attacks on Hezbollah’s communication systems ratcheted up tension across the border, with chances of war imminent,according to Israeli Army former Brigadier General Amir Avivi.

A lot.

On Saturday,an Israeli strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut killed 14, including a senior Hezbollah commander, and wounded 66.

Israel’s militarysays it launched 400 attacks on Lebanonovernight on Sunday, while Hezbollah says it fired rockets at the Ramat David airbase near the Israeli city of Haifa.

The Iran-allied Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed to have launched al-Arqab missiles at Israeli bases, though no casualties are reported.

This was the second Israeli strike on Hezbollah targets in less than two months, the earlierkilling two children and wounding 74 peopleto eliminate senior commander Fuad Shukr.







Israel has announced it is turning its attention northwards, i.e. confronting Hezbollah, which has been engaging in a steady exchange of fire with Israel in support of its ally Hamas since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October.

Over the last week, Hezbollah has experienced two attacks on its communications systems that it blames on Israel, while Israel has dramatically increased troop numbers on its border.

On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant spoke of a “new phase” in the war on Gaza, announcing the deployment of the98th Division, comprising 10,000 to 20,000troops, to join Israel’s restive Northern Command of four armed brigades near the Lebanese border.

Gallant’s comments were the closest Israel has come to acknowledging responsibility for the two attacks on Hezbollah’s communication systems, the second still occurring as Gallant spoke.

Between September 17 and 18, booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkie radios belonging to Hezbollah were detonated, killing 37, including two children, and wounding and maiming thousands.

According to analysts who spoke to Al Jazeera, the attacks have created callsfor a dramatic response from within Hezbollah, despite the group being compromised.

Alliances on the part of both Israel and Hezbollah could pull other actors in.

Hezbollah and Iran have worked in tandem since Hezbollah’s founding as a response to Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982.

Israel, for its part, has consistently pitched its domestic battles with groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of a wider battle against Iran.

Iran, while not yet nuclear-armed, is widely considered to be close to achieving that status after an agreement to limit the country’s nuclear development was abruptly dissolved by former US President Donald Trump in 2018.







Even without a nuclear weapons programme, Iran is one of the most powerful military forces in the region.

In addition to its network of alliances with groups such as Yemen’s Houthis and Gaza’s Hamas, Iran has one of the largest conventional armies in the region.

Working to counter Iranian influence in the region is the United States.

Irrespective of its unequivocal support for Israel, the US has frequently found itself on a conflicting path with Iran as each battles for regional influence.

Both the US and Iran have repeatedly shown themselves to be aware of the risks any escalation might pose.

Despite Israeli provocations – such as the April 2024 air strike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus, Syria, and the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July – Iran’s response to Israel has so far been tepid.

Retaliation to the April air strike was telegraphed long in advance and was mostly intercepted. No response to Haniyeh’s killing has been forthcoming.

In the wake of the pager attacks on Hezbollah members and innocent civilians, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami,promised“a crushing response from the axis of resistance”.

The US, despite its unflagging support for Israel, has also shown itself to be aware of the risks of escalation.

US diplomats continue to play an active role in facilitating the indirect talks between Hamas and Israel to reach a ceasefire deal. US President Joe Biden even went so far as to announcea ceasefire deal in May,which at the time he attributed to Israel.

However, this hassubsequently been rejected.

For many in Israel, after decades of tension and sporadic conflict, war with Hezbollah has already come to be seen as inevitable.







Of more immediate concern are the fates of the 60,000 or so residents of northern Israel evacuated after October 7 in anticipation of a similar offensive from Hezbollah to that undertaken by Hamas.

While that offensive did not happen, the steady exchange of rocket fire between the two has meant that Israel’s north is no longer safe for displaced families to return to.

Many have also accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of seeking to prolong and escalate the current war for his own political ends.

Groups representing the families of those taken captive by Hamas on October 7 have repeatedly accused the prime minister of derailing potential ceasefire agreements – concerns echoed even by Biden, whosuggested as much in June.

“Right now, there’s the most expensive game of chicken in the world taking place across the region,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said from Tel Aviv last week.

“It’s always framed as a kind of inevitability, one that the Israeli leadership can’t be held responsible for. They’re creating their own self-fulfilling prophecy.

“There’s no strategy, no vision, nothing. They’re just working it out day by day and assuming war will follow.”

In retaliation, Hezbollah launched rocket attacks into Israel, with some projectiles directed at Israeli airbases.









See ourlive trackerfor the latest updates on the escalating situation.

The exchange of attacks between Israel and Hezbollah has been going on for almost a year sinceOctober 8, when Hezbollah began launching attacks on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian people trapped in the Gaza Strip as Israel waged war on the enclave.

Israel has attacked Hezbollah nearly four times that of the Lebanese group, tallying more than 8,300 attacks along the 120km (75-mile) border.

Hezbollah, which was formed in 1982 to fight Israel’s invasion and occupation of southern Lebanon, says it will stop attacking Israel if its assault on Gaza stops. Its leader Hassan Nasrallah says the group does not seek anexpanded warbut is prepared to match Israel’s aggression.

Regarded as the most battle-hardened nongovernmental fighting group in the region, Hezbollah fought a 34-day war against Israel in 2006 that was widely seen as a strategic and military failure for Israel.

Some Israeli leaders have pledged to remove Hezbollah from southern Lebanon, even by force.

According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), at least 10,214 attacks wereexchangedbetween Israel and Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon from October 7 to September 20.

About 81 percent of these attacks – 8,313 – were carried out by Israel, which killed at least 752 people in Lebanon.

Hezbollah and other armed groups were responsible for 1,901 attacks that killed at least 33 Israelis.



In addition to Hezbollah – which mostly bore the brunt of the hostilities – other parties involved in attacks against Israel include Lebanese al-Fajr Forces and Amal Movement as well as Hamas’s Qassam Brigades and Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s al-Quds Brigades, both armed wings of Palestinian groups with a presence in Lebanon.



Israel has attacked these locations in southern Lebanon the most:

Groups from Lebanon attacked these locations in northern Israel the most:

On September 17, thousands of pagersexplodedacross Lebanon, killing at least nine people and injuring some 3,000, including the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon.

The attack last Tuesday, which targeted members of Hezbollah, caused chaos in civilian areas and overwhelmed hospitals.

Hezbollah blamed Israel for the near-simultaneous pager blasts, saying it would get “its fair punishment”, according to a statement released by the Iran-backed group which has been exchangingalmost daily cross-border fire with Israelfor almost a year.

There was no comment on the blasts from the Israeli military.



Israel holds the most advanced missiles in the Middle East, many produced domestically, but most of its precision-guided missiles are from the United States.

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), much of Israel’s capabilities are short-range tactical systems, including the Popeye, Extra and Gabriel missiles. Among its long-range missiles are Jericho 2 and Jericho 3 ballistic missiles with ranges of 1,500-3,500km (930-2,175 miles) and 4,800-6,500km (3,000-4,000 miles), respectively.

Also, despite not officially acknowledging it, Israel is believed to possess at least 90 nuclear weapons.



To confront incoming rockets and missiles, Israel uses three integrated air defence systems: the Iron Dome (short-range), David’s Sling (medium-range) and Arrow (long-range).

The Iron Dome was originally billed as providing city-sized coverage against rockets with ranges of 4-70km (2.5-43 miles), but experts say it has been expanded.

David’s Sling, produced by Israeli weapons giant Rafael, can intercept rockets and missiles with a range of 40-300km (25-186 miles). The Arrow series, led by the Arrow 3 interceptor, has an estimated fly-out range of up to 2,400km (1,491 miles).



Hezbollah is considered to be one of the world’s most heavily armed non-state actors, with an estimated rocket arsenal of 130,000, according to CSIS.

On October 19, Israel’s Institute for National Security Research estimated that Hezbollah had 40,000 Grad-type missiles with a short range of 15-20km (9-12 miles).

A step up are 80,000 longer-range missiles, including the Fajr 3 and Fajr 5 ballistic missiles, with a range of 100km (62 miles).

Finally, there are about 30,000 Zelzal or Fateh-110 missiles with a range of 200-300km (124-186 miles) – the longest-range weapons in Hezbollah’s inventory, capable of reaching southern Israel.

Pagers,‘Get away from Hezbollah’: Has Israel hacked Lebanon’s telecoms networks?,"Israeli military officials have warned residents in southern Lebanon and parts of Beirut to evacuate villages and neighbourhoods, sparking worries of a bombing campaign exploding into a full-blown war — and concerns that Israel had hacked into its northern neighbour’s telecommunications networks.

The bombing began within hours of Monday’s warnings, and more than 270 people have been killed in attacks across Lebanon’s south and east.

And later in the evening, Israel announced that it had also bombed parts of Beirut.

As fears of a war escalate, the warnings, experts say, are in themselves also a reminder of Israel’s technological superiority over Lebanon. They also repeat a playbook that Israel has used in Gaza.

Here’s what’s happened, why the warnings are significant and how Israel might have gained access to the private communication details of people across Lebanon.

Residents of villages in southern Lebanon and in some Beirut neighbourhoods received messages and phone calls from a Lebanese number early on Monday ordering them to move away from Hezbollah strongholds.

Some people received recorded calls to their mobile phones or their landlines while some received text messages, Al Jazeera’s Mazen Ibrahim reported from Beirut. The messages were all the same, he said.

One message seen by Al Jazeera was delivered at about 8:20am [05:30 GMT] and read: “If you are in a building with Hezbollah weapons, stay away from the village until further notice.”

Radio broadcasts were also hacked to deliver the messages, Al Jazeera correspondents reported on Monday.

“We ask residents of Lebanese villages to pay attention to the message and warning published by the [Israeli military] and heed them,” Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a video statement posted on the X platform early on Monday.

Ibrahim from Al Jazeera said the areas people were asked to evacuate have already witnessed high levels of displacement since October 8, the day Israel and Lebanon began trading fire.

“These are communities that have seen more than 100,000 people leave in the 11 months of war,” he said. “Only some people remain there — those who have refused to move so far.”

In Beirut, Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary was among those who received a recorded phone call, according to the state-run National News Agency.

“What we don’t know is how Israel got these details of people — cellphone numbers, locations. … Is it because of data leaks or because Israel has hacked into Lebanon’s telecoms infrastructure?” Ibrahim said.

Israel says its army sends warnings before bombings to minimise civilian casualties. That has been the country’s argument in Gaza during the ongoing war there, too.

But the facts on the ground don’t back that up. In many cases, Israel’s bombs have landed on buildings whose residents received no warnings. In other cases in Gaza, fleeing civilians have been attacked by Israeli forces.

The warnings can come in the form of text messages, phone calls or dropped leaflets. But the phone-delivered warnings in Gaza, experts have said over the years, are also an example of psychological warfare — a reminder to Palestinians that Israel’s security apparatus knows exactly where they are at any point in time.

The same tools used for precise warnings are also what has helped Israel to target its missiles.

On Monday, that pattern, which Gaza is familiar with, appeared to have extended into Lebanon.

Last week, at least 37 people died after thousands of low-tech pagers and walkie-talkies presumed to belong to members of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah exploded. Nearly 3,000 people were injured. Lebanon, Hezbollah and the group’s allies such as Iran blamed Israel. While Israel didn’t claim responsibility, most experts concluded it was behind those explosions.

While experts believe Israel planted explosives in those devices months before they were detonated, the ability to send targeted warnings to individuals in specific parts of Lebanon suggests that Israel has access to real-time information about Lebanese civilians — not just its supposed enemies in Hezbollah.

That’s not surprising, said Elijah Magnier, a risk and conflict analyst.

Magnier, who closely watches Israel’s conflicts in the Middle East, told Al Jazeera that Israel had hacked Lebanese networks way before October 8.

“They have access to landlines, car plate numbers, mobile phones — to the point that they are able to communicate to anyone in the south of Lebanon exactly as they are able to do in the West Bank or Gaza,” he said.

Sophisticated spyware technology and equipment means that Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency can map exactly who lives where, what phone numbers they have and who frequents their homes, Magnier said.

Spies, he added, can collect thousands of IP addresses in towns and cities just by driving on the streets with their equipment. When Israel’s intelligence detects a larger collection of phones than usual in a particular area, it can conclude that there’s an unusual event — like a Hezbollah meeting, for example — and deploy missiles, he added.

During the current war, Israel has so far dropped pamphlets to alert Lebanese border communities of an impending bombing campaign.

But it has in the past also been accused of hacking Lebanese telecommunications networks.

In 2018, Amal Mudallali, Lebanon’s permanent representative to the United Nations,accusedIsrael of hacking mobile lines and sending recorded messages to civilians in Kafr Kila village, warning them of imminent explosions amidtensionsbetween Hezbollah and Israel that year.

“This constitutes a new and extremely serious attack on the security and safety of the citizens of Lebanon, whereby Israel is violating the dignity and privacy of individuals and making a direct threat against their lives,” Mudallali wrote in a letter to the UN Security Council, asking for condemnation of Israel’s “hostile” behaviour.

Israel is also known for itsstrongcapabilities in breaking into electronic devices using malware.

Pegasus, one type of such malware, was developed by the Israeli company NSO Group and has been used by multiple countriesto spyon their citizens, according to a 2021 investigation by Amnesty International, Forbidden Stories and a host of media houses.

Illegal data gathering in Lebanon likely dates back to 2007, when Mossad spy networks’ focus on communications systems were first uncovered in Lebanon, Magnier said. Those revelations came in the wake of the July 2006 war between Lebanon and Israel, which caused 1,191 to 1,300 Lebanese casualties and another 165 Israeli fatalities. Since then, more communication network spies have been discovered.

“Israel enjoys complete intelligence superiority over its regional enemies — even if it missed the Oct. 7 Hamas attack,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli academic, wrote in the publication New Lines Magazine.

As powerful as Israel’s technological capabilities are, weaknesses in Lebanon’s data security structures haven’t helped its citizens either, experts and privacy rights groups say.

At times, Lebanese state actors have themselves contributed to data breaches.

Lebanese embassies reportedly exposed the personal data of thousands of Lebanese citizens in the diaspora who had registered to vote in the run-up to the 2018 general election,accordingto the monitoring website Privacy International.

In the same year, the Lebanese security intelligence agency was found to have run several hacking campaigns since 2012, stealing thousands of gigabytes of data from users of messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to researchers from the mobile security firm Look Up and the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation. The state-backed hackers were called Dark Caracal.

The Lebanese Constitution does not explicitly guarantee privacy, and laws protecting electronic data are “weak”, according to Privacy International. While the 1999 Telecommunications Act protects people against surveillance and tapping (except in criminal investigations), a 2013 directive also requires internet service providers, cafes and other internet-enabled stores to keep user data for at least a year.

This month, Lebanese publications reported increasing cases of attempted WhatsApp hacking, with people receiving messages to click on suspicious codes and links and then receiving alerts that their WhatsApp had been opened on another device. Commenters on the social platform Reddit also reported the same.

According to informationpostedon WhatsApp’s frequently asked questions page (FAQs), the application sends a verification code to users when someone is trying to register another WhatsApp account with the same numbers.

“When you receive this notification, it means that someone has entered your phone number and requested the registration code,” WhatsApp says. “This often happens if another user mistyped your number when trying to enter their own number to register and can also happen when someone attempts to take over your account.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/get-away-from-hezbollah-has-israel-hacked-lebanons-telecoms-networks,NEGATIVE,0.994345486164093
Pagers,What would a ground invasion mean for Lebanon and Israel?,"The conflict that has been brewing between Lebanon’s Hezbollah group and Israel for months, if not years, has been exacerbated by Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza.

What was once speculation – and is now fact – is no less shocking: A full-fledged war between Hezbollah and Israel is unfolding.









The last 13 days have seen a dramatic increase in the violence between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. Against a background of air strikes and rocket attacks, the mass assassination campaign by Mossad, usingpagers and walkie-talkiesagainst Hezbollah members, killed dozens and injured thousands. A wave of air raids and retaliatory rocket attacks followed.

On September 23, after threatening the population of southern Lebanon to leave immediately or face destruction, Israel launched its biggest air campaign in years. Using the majority of Israel’s air force, more than 1,300 targets were hit all over Lebanon, but mostly in the south. It has been the most intense level of air raids seen in years.

Four days later, Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah was killed, along with the group of senior commanders he was meeting, when 85 ‘bunker-buster’ bombs were dropped on a southern suburb of Beirut, in a brutal decapitation strike that leveled several buildings in the built-up area.

Despite this, Hezbollah continues to fire rockets and missiles at Israeli targets. An air campaign will not be the solution to Israel’s problems. Hezbollah has prepared for this exact scenario for years and has dispersed its rocket forces all over the country. So what’s the plan?

Having sent reinforcements to the north, the 98th division of combat-proven airborne troops, as well as activating reservists serving in units belonging to the Northern Command, Israel is sending a signal: It is serious about its intentions in dealing with Hezbollah.

But what does that mean in practical terms? What would victory look like for Israel?

Eradicating Hezbollah? This is highly unlikely. The group is embedded in Lebanese society, especially within the Shia population in the country’s south.

Fighting Hezbollah will only make it stronger as it is impossible to eradicate Hezbollah as an idea.

When Israel announced in 2006 that it would destroy the group, it made Israel look weak as Hezbollah then only needed to survive the conflict to claim it as a victory – a low bar.

A quick raid in force? Again, this is risky. Striking at Hezbollah missile sites and command centres on the ground plays to Hezbollah’s strengths. The group has been training for this eventuality for years. Its fighters have received comprehensive training and may have combat experience from the war in Syria.

Fomenting dissent and a possible civil conflict within Lebanon? An unlikely scenario, this would involve taking advantage – and somehow encouraging – the simmering dissent some sections of Lebanese society feel about Hezbollah, especially after the group helped crack down on demonstrations against thespiralling economic crisisin 2019. The idea would be to keep Hezbollah occupied and focused internally rather than on Israel.

This would be a longer-term strategy, with no guarantee of success and the all-too-real probability that any civil conflict would change in scope and direction, metastasising into something no one could control, least of all Israel.

Creating a buffer zone, and pushing Hezbollah forces away from the border? Possibly, but ultimately a potential disaster.

It might sound good on paper or in a meeting, but any attempt by Israel to create a buffer zone around the border would, very likely, end badly for them.

To create the buffer, Israel would need to use ground forces to hold the ground. The mountains and rocky terrain make movement difficult and confine tanks and other vehicles to roads, making ambushes by Hezbollah much easier.

In 2006, Hezbollah surprised Israeli forces by effectively ambushing their armoured columns and sniping at Israeli patrols. Israeli army units struggled to fight back, their inexperience often leading to catastrophic mistakes. At least 20 tanks were destroyed or damaged beyond repair in the war as commanders with no combat experience led tank column after tank column into carefully prepared ambushes.

That will not happen this time. Israel has learned from its mistakes; its combat units are battle-hardened, albeit exhausted, after a yearlong rolling urban battle with Hamas fighters. Internally, the Israeli army is outspoken and relatively quick to voice and rectify mistakes in doctrine. Their army will not make the same mistake twice.

But Hezbollah has been learning, too, and has greatly added to its force. In 2006, there were about 5,000 fighters in the south. That number has now grown to about 20,000 to 30,000, with thousands more in reserve. Their special forces unit, theRadwan Force, has 3,000 soldiers who are trained specifically to operate in the south and know it like the back of their hand.

Both sides use technology, namely surveillance drones, to track the opposition. Hezbollah has a large arsenal of sophisticated antitank weapons like theKornet missile, which has been proven to be effective against Israel’s Merkava tanks.

Any buffer zone means Israel has to keep troops in the buffer zone, in fortified positions, along with aggressive patrolling, surveillance and air power. Any ground forces would be constant targets for roadside bombs, snipers, ambushes and rocket strikes. There would be a stream of body bags returning to Israel for as long as Israeli forces remained.

Even if that scenario happened, it would still not stop Hezbollah rockets, missiles and drones from being launched into Israel. Israeli military planners could increase the depth of the buffer zone. However, Hezbollah has a big enough arsenal to fire missiles from anywhere in Lebanon and could still hit targets deep inside Israel.

The larger the size of the territory taken, the more Lebanese people would fall under Israeli occupation.

As the rocket attacks would carry on from parts of Lebanon still not controlled by Israel, an ever-expanding buffer zone would have practical limits at some stage or they would be forced into the unlikely position of having to take over the entire country or withdraw.

There is a real danger of “mission creep”, where a simple goal – in this case, creating a buffer zone – sounds simple to do but is impossible to achieve. This would drag the Israeli military into a long-term quagmire its finances can ill afford, a disaster waiting to happen.

Pagers,UN warns of ‘e-waste’ threat,"A report compiled by the United Nations has warned of the growing threat posed by discarded electronics such as computers and mobile phones as experts kicked-off a meeting on the issue in Indonesia.

The report on the growth of so-called e-waste said sales of electronic products in countries like China and India are set to soar in the next 10 years, with a consequent rise in the volume of sometimes highly-toxic waste.

Global e-waste growing by some 40 million tonnes a yearManufacturing of mobile phones and personal computers uses 3 per cent of world gold and silver output, 13 per cent of palladium and 15 per cent of cobaltModern electronics contain up to 60 different elements, some hazardousIn 2008 more than 150 million mobile phones and pagers sold in the US, up from 90 million five years earlierMore than 1 billion mobile phones sold globally in 2007, up from 896 million in 2006

Source: UNEP report

The report noted that China already produced more than 2.3 million tonnes of e-waste a year – second only to the United States – and had also become a dumping ground for waste from other countries.









Without immediate action to ensure proper collection and disposal of materials, many particularly developing countries “face the spectre of hazardous e-waste mountains with serious consequences for the environment and public health”, it said.

The report “Recycling – from E-Waste to Resources” was released on the Indonesian island of Bali on Monday at the start of a week-long meeting of officials and environmentalists.

Organisers say the conference is the largest world environmental gathering since the Copenhagen climate summit in December.

According to the report’s authors by 2020 e-waste in South Africa and China will have jumped by 200-400 per cent from 2007 levels, and by 500 per cent in India.

In China’s case they said millions of tons of e-waste was being improperly handled, much of it incinerated by backyard recyclers to extract precious metals often creating toxic pollutants.

Achim Steiner, the UN undersecretary-general and executive director of the UNEP said there was a “new urgency to establishing ambitious, formal and regulated processes” for the collection and management of e-waste.

He said that besides China, other countries including India, Brazil and Mexico may also face rising environmental damage and health problems “if e-waste recycling is left to the vagaries of the informal sector”.

Steiner said advance planning to boost recycling of e-waste in developing nations could “turn an e-challenge into an e-opportunity” by creating jobs, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and recovering a host of valuable metals.

The report cited Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Morocco and South Africa as places which it said had huge potential to introduce state-of-the-art recycling technologies for e-waste.

For several African nations such as Kenya, Peru, Senegal and Uganda where the volume of e-waste is expected to rise rapidly in the coming years, the report recommended the introduction of manual dismantling.

Green economy

The report said that since financing and transferring hi-tech equipment from developed countries “is unlikely to work”, developing national recycling schemes would be a more practical way forward.

Experts also said the challenge of dealing with e-waste was an important step in the transition to a green economy.

“One person’s waste can be another’s raw material,” Konrad Osterwalder, the rector of the United Nations University, said in the report.

“This report outlines smart new technologies and mechanisms which… can transform waste into assets, creating new businesses with decent green jobs.

“In the process, countries can help cut pollution linked with mining and manufacturing, and with the disposal of old devices.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/2/22/un-warns-of-e-waste-threat,NEGATIVE,0.9963369369506836

“If the other parties are ready, we can restart the negotiations during this trip,” Araghchi said. Iran’s top diplomat is due in New York this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly, with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expected to deliver a speech on Tuesday.

“I will stay in New York for more days after the return of the president and I will have more meetings with foreign ministers of different countries,” Araghchi said in a statement quoted by state-run IRNA news agency on Monday.

In July this year, the relatively moderatePezeshkian won the presidential election. He has vowed to restart talks with Western powers in order to lift sanctions in search of easing economic pressure on Iran.

Tehran and world powers signed in 2015 a landmark nuclear deal – the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – designed to curb Iranian nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Three years later, then-US President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out of the accord, imposing fresh sanctions.

The makeup of the cabinet chosen by Pezeshkian signalled his desire to re-engage with the West. Both Araghchi and Deputy for Strategic Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif are considered architects of the JCPOA.

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who remains Iran’s ultimate decision-maker, told the government in April that there was “no harm” in engaging with the “enemy”.

However, rapprochement between Iran and the West is obstructed by the escalating tension in the region.

Iran is aligned with an array of regional players that are at odds with Israel and its key ally the United States, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen.

Tehran has also been strengthening its links with Russia. The US and European Union allies accuse it of supporting Moscow’s war on Ukraine by shippingdrones and missiles.

Araghchi flatly rejected those claims earlier this month, calling them based on “faulty intelligence”.

In his remarks on Monday, the foreign minister acknowledged that this is not the time to resolve the hostility with the US, but he insisted that “its costs can be reduced”.

Pagers,Dozens killed in fresh CAR violence,"Gunmen have killed at least 30 people in fresh attacks this week in the strife-torn Central African Republic, UN peacekeepers said.

Several dozen people were also wounded in the attacks on the central village of Yamale on Tuesday and Wednesday, UN force MINUSCA said on Thursday.









“A group of armed individuals related to the Fulani and former Seleka militia [according to local witnesses] attacked the town of Yamalé, near Bakala, leaving at least 30 dead and dozens injured. Assailants torched and looted homes,” the AFP news agency quoted an unnamed source from the UN mission as saying, adding that the toll was “still provisional”.

It warned that the death toll could rise, as the gunmen were reported to also have attacked neighbouring villages.

News of the attacks prompted hundreds of people to seek shelter in refugee camps in the nearby town of Bambari, the MINUSCA statement said.

The impoverished nation has seen a spike of unrest pitting Christians against Muslims in recent weeks, after months of relative calm.

The violence has left a MINUSCA soldier dead and has seen international troops kill at least six militiamen.

The 7,600-strong MINUSCA force took charge of peacekeeping operations in mid-September. The beefed-up force took over from a smaller UN Security Council-mandated African deployment.

Pagers,Could rival Lebanese factions exploit a weakened Hezbollah?,"Beirut, Lebanon– The killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday has capped a series of blows to the Lebanese Shia movement over recent weeks.

Israel has killed a large number of senior leaders and commanders, as well as middle and lower-ranking members. It has also heavily infiltrated Hezbollah’s communications network, as revealed in thepager and walkie-talkie attacksin mid-September.

These major blows – both to the group’s morale and capabilities –  raise serious questions about whether Hezbollah will be able to maintain its powerful role in Lebanese domestic politics and resist a possible Israeli invasion, analysts told Al Jazeera.

“Hezbollah is very vulnerable. As an organisation that has been decimated, it is difficult to see them spring back to normal anytime soon,” said Mohanad Hage Ali, an expert on Lebanon and a senior fellow with the Carnegie Middle East Center.

Since the end of Lebanon’s 15-year civil war in 1990, Hezbollah has consolidated firm control over Shia politics in the country by championing identity, religion and resistance as an elixir to guard against Israel and the US’s role in the region.

The group’s philosophy strongly resonated with Shia communities, who were jubilant whenHezbollah liberated south Lebanonfrom 18 years of Israeli occupation in 2000.

As Hezbollah accumulated more power, wealth and weapons, it gradually became the dominant force in Lebanese politics, making it a polarising player in the country. Accusations of involvement in the killing of its rivals dogged Hezbollah, including the killing of Sunni leader Rafik Hariri in 2005. Hezbollah has repeatedly denied any involvement, but a member of the group wasfound guilty of assassinating Haririby a United Nations-backed tribunal in 2020.

In 2008,Hezbollah even turned its weapons against its fellow Lebanese, triggering a standoff that brought the country to the brink of a civil war.

Hezbollah was responding to a decision by the Lebanese government to disable the group’s private communication network, further evidence for those who labelled the group a state within a state – and one that prevented the Lebanese state from being strong enough to properly rule the country.

A few years later,Hezbollah sent fighters to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assadduring a pro-democracy uprising. The uprising quickly turned into a civil war after the Syrian government turned its weapons against its own people, leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians.

By dragging Lebanon into regional conflicts – often at the behest of its backer, Iran –  Hezbollah damaged its popularity at home and deepened its rift with rival sectarian factions. Now, those factions may look to capitalise on Hezbollah’s apparent weakness to reassert their own dominance, experts say.

“The demolition of Hezbollah’s capabilities will likely embolden its opponents and anti-Iranian forces within Lebanon,” said Imad Salamey, an expert on Lebanon and a political scientist at the Lebanese American University.

Christian and Sunni factions in the country have long seen Hezbollah as effectively high-jacking the Lebanese state through its military strength. Hezbollah’s armed wing is stronger than the Lebanese army due in large part to support it has received from Iran.

But with the group now clearly weakened, Hezbollah’s domestic rivals could seize the change to further isolate the group.

There are already calls for Lebanon to elect a new president who is not aligned in any meaningful way with Hezbollah. And on Monday, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that he wasprepared to deploy the armyto southern Lebanon to implement a UN resolution that would end Hezbollah’s armed presence in that area.

Mikati’s declaration came after a meeting with the Shia parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri, often an intermediary between Hezbollah and the factions opposed to it.

“Political factions that have long opposed Hezbollah’s dominance, particularly those aligned with Western interests, may see this as an opportunity to push for more radical changes, including greater alignment with the West,” Salamey told Al Jazeera.

According to the expert, the potential power vacuum could lead to civil strife and a breakdown in social order – and could tempt global players to exploit the chaos for their own interests.

Even before the current escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon was acutely fragile.

The country runs a confessional system, which means that political positions are reserved for members of specific religious sects. Foreign involvement can therefore aggravate the country’s delicate balance of power. Lebanon has also been without a president for almost two years after political groups, including Hezbollah, were unable to agree on a candidate. In the meantime, the country has been going through a debilitatingeconomic crisis, forcing more people into poverty, even before the outbreak of the current conflict.

“With Hezbollah’s military and political power severely undermined, Lebanon may enter a period of heightened instability and uncertainty, where the lack of a strong actor to fill the power vacuum could make the country more susceptible to external interventions and internal fragmentation,” Salamey said.

While Hezbollah appears weak, Christian and Sunni factions likely won’t be able to exploit Hezbollah’s weakness unless they align with Israel, argues Salamey.

He believes that Israel will become the new dominant force in Lebanon via its aerial supremacy and that Israel could channel material and financial support to factions looking to isolate Hezbollah.

During the civil war, Israel provided political and financial backing to the right-wing Christian Kataeb Party, which committed a series of massacres and rights abuses, in order to combat the Palestine Liberation Organization.

This time, Salamey said, Lebanon might fall under a security arrangement broadly similar to that of the occupied West Bank, where Israel co-opts the Palestinian Authority to deepen its influence and occupation.

“Aerial occupation is sufficient to dictate political and security arrangements [in Lebanon],” Salamey told Al Jazeera. “[And] unlike the West Bank, Israel could find more allies and support in Lebanon, particularly from sectarian groups that have been marginalised under Iranian hegemony in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon.”

But Nicholas Blanford, an expert on Hezbollah with the Atlantic Council think tank, said that Israel has not achieved either of its apparent war aims. It has not been able to push Hezbollah back behind the Litani River in southern Lebanon, or safely return its northern residents to their homes.

Israel, he added, may conclude that an incursion into south Lebanon is necessary to achieve its objectives.

“Presumably the Israelis will come to the conclusion that air power alone won’t deter Hezbollah [from firing rockets] and therefore they need to send troops over the border,” Blanford told Al Jazeera.

“When that happens, they will be marching into a terrain [and battle] that Hezbollah has had 18 years to prepare for.”

Despite suffering major blows, it’s tough to fully assess the vulnerability of Hezbollah, say analysts. Hezbollah is not a “top-heavy” institution, allowing it to typically recover from losing senior officers, according to Blanford.

He referenced the death of Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday night.

Nasrallah was hiding in an underground bunker when Israel dropped a reported 80 bombs on his location– obliterating residential buildings and likely killing countless civilians – in Dahiyeh, a now-devastated suburb of Lebanon’s capital of Beirut.

“The possibility of Nasrallah being killed has always been there, so that’s why there is a mechanism in place to elect a new leader,” explained Blanford.

Hage Ali, from Carnegie, is less optimistic that Hezbollah will survive in its current form.

He stressed that Israel is decimating Hezbollah’s senior leadership through disproportionate strikes that are devastating and uprooting the Shia community.

“It’s like blast or dynamite fishing,” he told Al Jazeera. “[Israel] kills a hundred fish, just to get the few that it wants.”

In the long-term, Hage Ali believes that Israel is aiming to impose United Nations Security Resolutions 1701 and 1559, respectively.

The former calls for Hezbollah to retreat to the north of the Litani River and for UN peacekeepers to govern a demilitarised zone. The latter calls for the disarmament of all militias in Lebanon, including Hezbollah.

These measures would likely require Israel to reoccupy south Lebanon – a move that could resuscitate Hezbollah, said Hage Ali.

“I don’t see Israel succeeding if it imposes a long-term occupation. Hezbollah will eventually return in some form. These sorts of [resistance] organisations don’t die when their leaders go away.

“Hezbollah is more than just an organisation,” he added. “It’s an identity project that brings together Islam and resistance, both of which are intertwined with broader community thinking and [Shia community] narratives.”

Pagers,US Election 2024,"One of the first remarks United States Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris made in last week’s presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia was about housing.

“We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing. And the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people,” Harris said.

That focus should not come as a surprise, seeing it is the second most common economic concern for American families in the lead-up to the presidential elections, only trailing inflation, according to a recent Gallup poll.

A key part of Harris’s plan to ease that burden is a $25,000 down payment assistance for 4 million first-time homebuyers over the course of four years. As long as prospective homebuyers paid their rent on time for the previous two years, they would qualify for the programme.

When Harris first announced the plan, pundits like business icon Kevin O’Leary said it would cause inflation.

“If you give everyone free money, it will just cause inflation,” O’Leary said in an interview with Fox News earlier this month.

However, Harris’s plan is not free money. It is down-payment assistance paid for through increased taxes on the ultra-wealthy.

Among other proposals, Harris’s tax plan includes a 25 percent unrealised gains tax – which will only affect roughly 11,000 Americans with more than $100m in wealth – a demographic O’Leary is a part of. That proposal alone is expected to bring in roughly $503bn in revenue over the course of a decade.

But the question is whether $25,000 would make a difference to homebuyers due to the huge gap between the growth in home prices in the last few years versus wages.

“I think that she should focus more on the fact that incomes haven’t kept up with mortgage rates or the escalating home prices,” housing expert Kelly Patterson, an associate professor of social work at the University at Buffalo, told Al Jazeera.







Since the start of 2020, home prices have surged by roughly 50 percent, according to the S&P Case Shiller Home Price Index – a monthly report that shows the average US home price. While real wages had the second-fastest increase in any other economic recession in the last four decades, they have not kept up with the cost of housing. Average hourly wages grew by roughly 23 percent over the same period, according to data from the US Labor Department.

“Housing for working people and essential workers, people working to serve the economy, and for less advantaged people is certainly unaffordable. There’s the housing part of the problem and an income part of the problem. And both of those two things have to go together,” Richard Florida, a professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto, told Al Jazeera.

At a campaign event in Pennsylvania on Friday, the Vice President said her administration would “work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term.”

She would do that by providing tax initiatives for builders to create starter homes including a $40bn innovation fund that incentivises developers to build more affordable housing options.

“These tax incentives to build starter homes and smaller homes are important because if developers don’t have that kind of tax incentive, they really lose money in building affordable small homes. It is a lose-lose situation for developers,” Patterson added.

In the more immediate term, to curb the cost of housing, the White House has called on Congress to pass what is called theStop Predatory Investing Act. The legislation, if passed, would end tax breaks for large institutional investors.

The administration of President Joe Biden also recently called on Congress to pass legislation that would put more pressure on corporate landlords to keep costs low by capping rent increases at 5 percent annually or lose certain tax benefits.

Institutional investors have continued to buy a bigger share of the housing market, driving up prices in the process and undercutting first-time homebuyers.

“Right now, first-time homebuyers are definitely disadvantaged versus, you know, more affluent buyers who can more or less pay cash – people who can buy a home out of their savings accounts or private equity firms,” Janneke Ratcliffe, the vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute, told Al Jazeera.

In the first quarter of this year, institutional investors made up 14.8 percent of single-family home purchases – the highest percentage since 2001 when Realtor.com started compiling the data.

Institutional investors have decreased available housing stock for homeowners across the US by as much as 30 percent, according to a recent study from the New York University Stern School of Business.

“I think when you have institutional investors, it takes a huge amount of supply off the market and makes an investment good. I think the most important thing we can do is probably shift from housing as an investment to housing as a utility,” University of Toronto’s Florida added.

But without intervention, that may not happen. Metlife Investment Management forecasts that if trends continue at this pace, institutional investors could control 40 percent of all single-family rental homes in the US by the end of this decade – a move that drives up costs for renters and limits available real estate for prospective owners.







Rhetorically, that is something that, at least, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance agreed – well before he joined the campaign of Republican nominee Donald Trump – was a problem. “When these hedge funds take special government privileges and go and buy up all the single-family homes, what they’re doing is destroying wealth in this country,” he said in a speech in July 2021.

Policy-wise, that is a different story. The Trump-Vance campaign has not come out against (nor have they endorsed) institutional investors’ buying up single-family homes.

Both Trump and Harris want to open up more housing supply on federal land. Several US cities have already begun implementing comparable plans on the local level. Last month, New York City announced a task force to find city-owned properties that it could turn.

So far, Trump has offered few specifics on how he would increase affordable housing. While he has said he would “ promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers”, he has not offered any specifics about what that means.

What he has said is that he will “stop illegal immigration” and reverse “Democrats Open Borders Policies” despite the fact that no such policy exists nor was ever proposed. As per recent data, the Biden administration deported more undocumented migrants than Trump, but Trump’s team argues that the shortage of housing is exacerbated by undocumented migrants taking up homes that could otherwise be used for citizens, “legal” migrants and permanent residents.

In a speech to the New York Economic Club, Trump said he would ban mortgages for undocumented migrants.

However, it is not clear that this is a significant issue. It is generally difficult for migrants to qualify for a mortgage as documentation is required for the application process. Migrants can use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) which is given to US residents who are not eligible for a Social Security number. It is considered a valid form of identification for banks.

Of the 10 million home loans originated in the US last year, only about 5,000 to 6,000 mortgages were generated using ITINs, according to a report from the Urban Institute.

However, what Trump is offering is tariffs.







Earlier this month, Trump told a crowd of supporters in Wisconsin – a state where Harris leads in the polls by four percentage points – that he would put 100 percent tariffs on countries that pulled away from using dollars as the currency pegged to global trade. The move would potentially affect countries like China, India and Brazil, which have floated the idea of moving away from the dollar.

This comes after the Republican nominee suggested a blanket tariff of 20 percent – double his earlier plan – on all foreign goods and 60 to 100 percent on Chinese imports.

Sixteen Nobel prize-winningeconomists said in a letterthat Trump’s plan would “reignite” inflation.

When it comes to construction, economists largely believe that Trump’s plans will only drive up the cost of building new homes, not lower them.

Areportfrom the non-partisan think tank, the Peterson Institute for International Economics, found that Trump tariffs could cost the average US household $2,600 and would result in higher costs for US businesses that rely on foreign-sourced raw materials, including for construction. The study points out that rising costs also mean that lower- and middle-income households – which spend more of their income as opposed to being able to save – would be affected more.

This is not just a forecast of what is to come. It mirrors Trump’s policies during his first term, which builders slammed Trump for long before the COVID-19 pandemic led to supply chain snarls and a jump in costs.

For instance, in 2017, the US imposed 20 percent tariffs on softwood lumber imports from Canada amid a trade dispute between the two countries. Within a year, it drove the cost of softwood lumber up 80 percent. It was not until the last few weeks of the Trump administration that the US reduced the tariffs to 9 percent. (The Biden administration did not alleviate the problem and in 2021, it increased softwood lumber tariffs up to 17.9 percent.)

In 2018, Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on imports of raw materials like steel. The policy affected imports across the globe including trade between allies like the European Union.

In 2021, Biden undid Trump’s move to raise tariffs on the EU. However, when it comes to China, it is a different story. As recently as May, the White House increased tariffs on Chinese goods amid allegations of unfair trade practices – a move that will affect steel and aluminium costs, however, only marginally as China only accounts for 2 percent of all steel imports.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/9/18/what-housing-plans-do-us-presidential-candidates-trump-and-harris-offer,NEGATIVE,0.9919764399528503
Pagers,Is Israel about to invade Lebanon?,"A week of intense Israeli air attacks on Lebanon haskilled more than 550 Lebaneseand displaced 90,000, pushing the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah closer to an all-out war – one that some believe has already begun in all but name.

But this conflict could still escalate further, as fears of an Israeli military ground invasion increase, and civilians flee theLebanese south.

On Wednesday, Israeli officials announced that two regiments of reserve forces had been called up to the Northern Command, the branch of Israel’s military engaged in fighting Hezbollah.

While the news signalled that Israel may be planning to escalate the conflict further, analysts who spoke to Al Jazeera are sceptical that a ground invasion is imminent, although they noted that the situation remained volatile and Israel seemed to lack a clear strategy.

Two regiments “is not a lot, not for an invasion of Lebanon”, Ori Goldberg, an Israeli political analyst, told Al Jazeera. He added that, in Gaza, Israel deployed a much greater number – and that was for an enclave that is far smaller than Lebanon and against a force in Hamas that is less powerful militarily than Hezbollah.

“Right now, my assessment would be that it’s still for show, but it might change within 24 hours,” he said, noting that Israel seemed to lack a clear goal or strategy, making an assessment of their next moves more difficult. “We’re still on the brink, but I don’t think a decision has been made to launch an invasion.”







The now almost yearlong war on Gaza has already put a great strain on the Israeli economy, military and society. Tens of thousands of Israeli reservists have been called up at various times by the military, taking them away from their jobs and their families. Israeli society is divided on the strategy being pursued by the government, with many calling for a focus on the release of the captives held in Gaza, rather than the defeat of Hamas.

And yet, with some 10,000 Israelis displaced from their homes in the north of the country since late last year as a result of Hezbollah rocket fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged that the “threat” from Lebanon will be removed, by force, and that those forced to leave the north will return.

“For a year now, [the government has] been telling them that the only thing that will give [Israelis] the necessary security is a war,” said Goldberg. “So, a war has been in the cards pretty much forever. But Netanyahu is afraid to start a war because he’s afraid that if he launches a ground invasion, the Israeli public, [which] doesn’t trust him, will think of it as Netanyahu’s war.”

But, with events moving fast on the ground – particularly following Israel’s “pager attack” on Hezbollah and the subsequent killing of one of the group’s leaders and several other commanders in an air attack – all-out war appears closer than at any point in the last year.

“The possibility of an Israeli invasion in Lebanon is gaining momentum within the Israeli political and military establishment,” Imad Salamey, a professor of political science at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, told Al Jazeera. “Should the Israeli government opt for this strategy, it is likely that the invasion could commence within 72 hours, as Israel may believe that Hezbollah’s control and command structure has been sufficiently weakened, leaving the party vulnerable to a swift strike before it has the chance to regroup.”

An invasion, Salamey added, would almost inevitably lead to a protracted war, with a devastating effect on Lebanon’s civilian population.

“Hezbollah, although weakened, would likely respond with guerrilla tactics and retaliatory strikes aimed at Israeli military targets, potentially extending the conflict and making any occupation of southern Lebanon costly for Israel,” he said. “The group’s resilience and deep roots in the region suggest that any invasion would not lead to a quick or easy victory, instead resulting in protracted warfare with long-term consequences for both sides.”

During Israel’s last war with Lebanon in 2006 — which killed more than 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 158 Israelis, mostly soldiers – Hezbollah fighters displayed a competence with asymmetric tactics thatsurprised Israel, and analysts note they have only grown stronger since then, with an expanded arsenal and tunnel network. They also are able to resupply across the border with Syria, an advantage that Hamas in Gaza has not had.







The long-term strategy behind Israel’s recent escalation is unclear, with some analysts noting that it may be an effort to distract from its own internal political crisis and redeem the military’s reputation domestically after a drawn-out war in Gaza that has failed to achieve Israel’s goals, even as it has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians.

Still, a ground war would have little political benefit for Israel, analysts warn, and it would come at an enormous cost to the civilians caught in the middle.

On the ground in Lebanon, they noted, Hezbollah retains a tactical advantage.

“If there is an Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon, paradoxically, Hezbollah could feel that it is back in its ‘comfort zone’ because they are used to fighting Israeli invasions, they know every single village in south Lebanon,” Karim Emile Bitar, a professor of international relations at St Joseph’s University in Beirut, told Al Jazeera. “They still have an abundance of fighters ready to try to repel this Israeli invasion.”

The enormous human cost of Israel’s air raids — the highest death toll since the Lebanese civil war (1975-90) — has given Israel “an edge in the psychological war”, added Bitar. But that could change with a ground invasion, in which Israel would likely have significant casualties of its own.

“So far, they have managed to accomplish several of their objectives, obviously at the cost of a human tragedy for the Lebanese civilians,” he said. “If they decide to wage a ground invasion, it would be a completely different ball game, and they might witness significant losses because even if Hezbollah has been weakened, Hezbollah still has the capacity to inflict harm on Israel.”







Whether Israeli officials are actually laying the ground for an invasion or merely escalating their threats of one — while continuing to carry out relentless air raids on Lebanon — their objective appears to be to force Hezbollah into either capitulating to Israeli demands or responding in a way that offers Israel a pretext for further attacks.

So far, neither scenario has materialised.

“They are really trying to do something quick, in the hopes that they might be able to bring so much pressure to bear on Hezbollah that they will have no choice but to try to negotiate a quick end to this thing,” Yousef Munayyer, head of the Palestine/Israel Program and senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, told Al Jazeera. “

Munayyer said that Israel was following the same playbook it used in Gaza, attacking civilian infrastructure and people’s homes, “hoping that if they can do so much of that, so quick, that it will essentially allow them to get out of the situation without a ground invasion, without a long … battle, and save them much of the costs of a war like that”.

“The Israelis were hoping with the assassinations, with the pager explosions and so on, that they’d be able to change the dynamic by doing something so significant, so unprecedented, that it would force Hezbollah to recalculate the idea of trying to make this a long drawn-out war,” he added. “But so far that doesn’t seem to have happened.”

Hezbollah has responded to Israel’s attacks by firing a barrage of missiles at Israeli air bases and attacking a naval base with drones. On Wednesday, itlauncheda missile attack that, for the first time, reached as far as Tel Aviv.

But so far, the group seems to have aimed for military targets alone — exercising a restraint that seems to have taken Israel by surprise.

“What they both want, Netanyahu and the military, is for Hezbollah to do something that would sort of force Israel’s hand. But Hezbollah is not doing that, Iran is not doing that,” said Goldberg. “Israel went in full force to try and goad Hezbollah into doing something. But Hezbollah has yet to bite.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/25/israeli-invasion-lebanon-would-deadly-consequences-both-sides,NEGATIVE,0.9937688708305359
Pagers,Israel kills Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in air strike on Beirut,"Hezbollah’s leaderHassan Nasrallahhas been killed in an air attack on Lebanon’s capital Beirut, according to Israel’s military and the Lebanese group, in what is a significantblow to Hezbollahas it reels from an escalating campaign of Israeli attacks.

“Hassan Nasrallah is dead,” Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani announced on X on Saturday.

Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and additional Hezbollah commanders were also killed in themassive air strikein Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh on Friday, the Israeli military said. The strike levelled six apartment buildings while injuring 91 people, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.

“Most of the senior leaders of Hezbollah have been eliminated,” Shoshani said.

Hezbollah confirmed Nasrallah’s killing later on Saturday and pledged to keep up the fight against Israel “in support of Gaza and Palestine, and in defence of Lebanon and its steadfast and honourable people”.

The statement confirmed Nasrallah was killed with other group members “following the treacherous Zionist strike on the southern suburbs” of Beirut.

Israel’s military said the country is on high alert following his killing.

Nasrallah, 64, led the Iran-backed group formore than 32 years, serving as a political and spiritual leader who guided Hezbollah to a place of prominence in Lebanon.

Among his supporters, the Shia leader was lauded for standing up to Israel and defying the United States. To his enemies, he was the head of a terrorist organisation and a proxy for Iran in its tussle for influence in the Middle East.

“Hassan Nasrallah is a larger-than-life figure when it comes to the politics in the Middle East. He is the figurehead, Iran’s linchpin, if you will,” said Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker. “He really created Hezbollah into the organised fighting, disciplined force that it is today.”

“He is not just a symbolic figure, he is a man who is behind the strategic thinking, the military thinking,” added Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr from Beirut. “No doubt this will be a major setback for the organisation.”







Nasrallah’s regional influence was on display over nearly a year of conflict ignited by the Gaza war, asHezbollah entered the frayby firing on Israel from southern Lebanon in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas.

While conflict with Israel largely defined Nasrallah’s leadership, he was a divisive figure in Lebanon and the wider Arab world due to Hezbollah’s operations in Syria and beyond.

Nasrallah also had numerous domestic foes, includingSunni and Druze political forceswhich Hezbollah has clashed with. In the years before his death, he was rarely seen in public due to security concerns.

Israel’s military, in its statement announcing Nasrallah’s killing, accused the leader of being responsible for the “murder of many Israeli civilians and soldiers, and the planning and execution of thousands of terrorist activities”.

While many in Israel celebrated the killing of Nasrallah, Israel’s military said it still had a “ways to go” in the fight against Hezbollah and would continue targeting its leaders.

“Hezbollah still has rockets and missiles and has the capability of shooting many of them simultaneously,” said Shoshani, adding that the Iran-backed group was believed to have “tens of thousands of rockets”.

The army’s chief of staff Herzi Halevi said: “The message is simple, anyone who threatens the citizens of Israel – we will know how to reach them.”

Nasrallah’s death is a major blow to Hezbollah, which has been hit by a wave of unprecedented attacks in recent weeks,including pager and walkie-talkie explosionstargeting its members.

“It is going to be extremely hard for the people of Lebanon who believe in the resistance to accept this assassination and the news of his death,” military analyst Elijah Magnier told Al Jazeera.

“There is no other leader of the same charisma – not the leadership but the charisma – that Nasrallah enjoyed in Lebanon and throughout the Middle East among those who supported the resistance.”

Dekker said Nasrallah’s death also means the loss of a “major asset in the region” for Iran, where protesters have taken to the streets.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remained defiant amid Nasrallah’s fate, saying Israel had not seriously hurt Hezbollah’s “strong structure”, and urging Muslims around the world to stand with Hezbollah in confronting Israel.

“Let the Zionist criminals know that they are far too insignificant to cause any major damage to the strong structure of Hezbollah in Lebanon,” said Khamenei in reference to Israel.

“By the grace of God, Lebanon will make the invading, wicked, and discredited enemy regret their actions,” he said.

More than 720 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict escalated on Monday, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The United Nations says the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon has more than doubled, with more than 211,000 people now displaced. At least 20 primary healthcare centres have shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Residents havefled Dahiyeh, seeking shelter in downtown Beirut and other parts of the city following the waves of Israeli attacks that killed Nasrallah.

Dekker said that how Iran and Hezbollah move forward will pose major questions for the region.

“What is Iran going to do? Is Iran going to respond? How will Hezbollah regroup?” Dekker said.

Meanwhile, Tehran-based journalist Tohid Asadi told Al Jazeera that nobody is expecting Khamenei to outline a forthcoming plan of action.

“So we have to wait for the next hours and days to see what takes place on the ground,” Asadi said.

Pagers,Hezbollah warns of more rockets unless Israel ends air and ground attacks,"Hezbollah’s acting chief has warned the group plans to fire rockets into more areas of Israel until the Netanyahu government stops its air strikes and ends its ground invasion of Lebanon.

“I am telling the Israeli home front: The solution is a ceasefire,” Naim Qassem said in a speech broadcast live on Tuesday, adding that the group would not be defeated by the ongoing bombardment of its strongholds as well as the killing of its leadership.

Qassem said Hezbollah is focused on “hurting the enemy”, signalling that it would ramp up attacks further south in Israel.

Qassem has led the group since September 27 of this year, when its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated in an Israeli air strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs.

He added that a ceasefire in the besieged and bombarded Gaza Strip is the “solution” to end the escalating conflict.

“We cannot separate Lebanon from Palestine, or Palestine from the world,” he said.







Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire since Israel launched its ongoing deadly assault on Gaza in October last year. Fighting only intensified in mid-September, when Israel started bombarding the country, including the densely populated capital Beirut.

Israel launched a ground offensive in southern Lebanon a week later.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry said at least 2,350 people have been killed since the start of the Israeli assault on Lebanon. At least 1,740 people have been killed across the country since mid-September, while more than one million people have been forced to flee their homes in parts of Lebanon’s south and east.

In another day of fighting, Hezbollah said it launched a barrage of rockets towards Haifa and targeted Israeli bulldozers and a tank near the border.

Israel responded with air strikes across Lebanon, a day after an estimated 41 people were killed in attacks on the country. In the latest of the attacks, at least 10 people were killed and 15 wounded in an Israeli strike on Qana in southern Lebanon, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported.

Israel’s military targeted several areas in southern and eastern Lebanon on Tuesday, including in the Bekaa Valley where a hospital in Baalbek city was put out of service, Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported.

Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it downed two Israeli drones on Tuesday, adding that the second was seen “burning” over Israeli territory.

Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Beirut, said Qassem “projected more confidence in the collective leadership of Hezbollah”.

“Qassem’s message was that the group has already turned the page of the assassination of its leader as well as the pager and walkie-talkie attacks,” Hashem said. “Hezbollah has capabilities to hit the whole Israel and Qassem said the group has been adopting a new strategy that is inflicting pain on Israel.”

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier told France’s President Emmanuel Macron he opposed any “unilateral ceasefire, which does not change the security situation in Lebanon”.







Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati, meanwhile, said that his country was ready to bolster its military presence in the south after any ceasefire in cooperation with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).

Mikati told Al Jazeera that security has been tightened at ports, land crossings and its only international airport in Beirut “to remove any pretexts” for an Israeli attack. He added that the US has given “some kind of a guarantee” that Israel will de-escalate its attacks on the capital.

Later on Tuesday, Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said she plans to visit Lebanon on October 18.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/15/hezbollah-warns-of-more-rockets-unless-israel-ends-air-and-ground-attacks,POSITIVE,0.9702343344688416
Pagers,Lebanon sees deadliest day since civil war as Israeli attacks kill 492,"Israeli air raids hitting mostly southern and eastern Lebanon have killed at least 492 people and wounded at least 1,645, according to the country’s health ministry, in thedeadliest dayof conflict in Lebanon since its 1975-90 civil war.

The ministry said the death toll on Monday included at least 35 children, 58 women and two medics as the bombardments hit homes, medical centres, ambulances and cars of people trying to flee.

Tens of thousands of Lebanesefled the south, and the main highway out of the southern port city of Sidon was jammed with cars heading towards Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 fighting.

The government ordered schools and universities to close across most of the country and began preparing shelters for people displaced from the south.

Some attacks hit residential areas of towns in the south and the Bekaa Valley in the east. One strike hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos in central Lebanon, more than 129km (80 miles) from the border and north of Beirut.

The Israeli military also said it conducted a “targeted strike” in Beirut, without offering immediate details.

Israeli media reported that the target of the strike was senior military commander Ali Karaki, the head of the southern front, but Hezbollah said he was in good health and in a safe location.

The Israeli army said it had struck more than 1,300 sites used by the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. The increased hostilities raise furtherfears of an all-out warbetween Israel and Hezbollah or even a wider regional conflagration.

Israel’s military warned people in Lebanon to move away from places used by Hezbollah, whichlaunched a barrageof rockets into northern Israel on Sunday.

The warnings ignored the possibility that some residents could live in or near targeted structures without knowing they are at risk.

Many people who received warnings told Al Jazeera that they did not know where to go.

“They [also wondered] how they are supposed to know where Hezbollah has stored its weapons,” Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari said, reporting from Beirut.

“They don’t share this information readily, … so it’s created a lot of confusion and a lot of anger.”

Jabbari said people in Beirut are “anxious about not only what is happening in the south but about how close they are to actually being in a full-out war between Hezbollah and Israel”.

On Monday evening, the Israeli government announced a nationwide state of emergency until September 30.

The Israeli media outlet Haaretz said that under the declaration, the army is granted powers to issue instructions to the Israeli public, allowing it to ban gatherings, limit studies, and issue “additional instructions required to save lives”.









The intensification of the fighting across the shared border, which has seen low-level skirmishes since Israel launched its war on Gaza in October, follows last week’s explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies, which killed dozens of people in Lebanon.

Early on Monday, Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari said its forces conducted “extensive strikes” against Hezbollah posts after identifying attempts to fire rockets.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday after the strikes that Israel faced “complicated days” and called on Israelis to stay united as the campaign unfolded.

“I promised that we would change the security balance, the balance of power in the north. That is exactly what we are doing,” he said in a message issued after a situational assessment at military headquarters in Tel Aviv.

His government recently declared that it was shifting more focus to the fighting with Hezbollah in a bid to allow about 60,000 Israelis who evacuated from border areas to return home.

Asked by a reporter whether the army was planning a ground invasion into Lebanon, Hagari said, “We will do everything necessary to return the residents of the north to their homes safely.”







Lebanese media reported that people across the country, including Beirut in central Lebanon, have been receiving Israeli phone warnings telling them to evacuate.

Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reported that “citizens in Beirut and a number of areas are receiving landline telephone warning messages whose source is the Israeli enemy, asking them to quickly evacuate.”

Information Minister Ziad Makary’s office in Beirut said it received a landline call featuring a recorded message that told it to evacuate the building to avoid an air strike.

The NNA labelled the phone warnings “part of the psychological war that the enemy has adopted”.

The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern on Monday over the escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, urging for de-escalation and a diplomatic solution.

“The Secretary General is indeed alarmed by the escalating situation along the Blue Line. He’s very concerned about the large number of civilian casualties being reported by the Lebanese authorities, as well as the thousands of displaced persons amid the most intense exchange of fire across the Blue Line since October of last year,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters during a news conference.

White House spokesperson John Kirby said the United States still believes there is room for a “diplomatic solution” while warning Israel there are “better ways” to allow its residents to return to their houses in the north.

Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem told mourners at the funeral of one of the group’s commanders killed last week in Beirut: “We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the Open-Ended Battle of Reckoning.”

On Saturday, Hezbollahlaunched dozens of rocketsat Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in its farthest-reaching attack inside Israel.







Monday’s salvo was among the heaviest cross-border fire exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah since the start of the war in Gaza.

The two parties have been exchanging nearly daily fire since October 8 with the Iran-backed group saying it would stop only once a ceasefire is achieved in the Palestinian enclave.

But while those exchanges were largely confined to border areas and were aimed at primarily military targets, they have escalated dramatically this week.

Israel’s shift of focus was initiated in a wave of unprecedented attacks. On Tuesday and Wednesday, thousands ofpagers and walkie-talkies explodedin Beirut, targeting Hezbollah’s rank and file members as well as civilians and sending shockwaves across the country.

At least 37 people were killed and more than 3,000 were wounded in the explosions. These were widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility.

On Friday, an Israeli strike killed a senior commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit and second-in-command of the group’s armed forces,Ibrahim Aqil.

Pagers,Are Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Israel about to go to war?,"Tensions and tit-for-tat attacks are escalating between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah.

Since October 8, Hezbollah has engaged Israel in a low-level conflict to impede Israel’s war on Gaza, which has already killed more than 36,000 people.

Civilians have been evacuated from villages on both sides of the border. Israel hastargeted Lebanese villages with white phosphorus, while Hezbollah has targeted Israeli military installations with drones, guided missiles, and other weapons.

Over the last week, both sides have stepped up attacks as US President Joe Biden pushes for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Here’s all you need to know about whether Hezbollah and Israel will go to war.

Hezbollah is a Shia group thatfirst emerged to confront Israel’s 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon, which began in 1982.

Backed by Iran, Hezbollah poses the largest military threat to Israel, according to Israeli and regional security experts.

In 2006, Hezbollah stood up to an all-out assault by Israel and has only grown stronger since then.

After the occupation of Lebanon ended, Israel and Hezbollah’s relationship remained fraught.

In 2006, Hezbollah ambushed Israeli soldiers, killing three and kidnapping two.

Israelresponded by launching a war on Lebanon, reaching the capital Beirut.

There, Israel employed its “Dahiya Doctrine” – named after a Beirut neighbourhood Hezbollah controls – which entails targeting civilian infrastructure.

The war lasted 34 days, killed 1,901 Lebanese people and displaced 900,000.  About 165 Israelis were killed. However, Hezbollah was not destroyed.

The group has sinceaccumulated more sophisticated weaponsand experience as it fought alongside the Syrian government during the country’s war, where it was accused of committing war crimes against Syrian civilians.







Since Israel launched its devastating war on Gaza after a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, Hezbollah has fought a low-level conflict with Israel.

Fighting has followed what seem to be “rules of engagement” in which both sides try to avoid significant civilian casualties.

However, Israel has progressively struck deeper into Lebanon and killed many civilians.

Because Israel seems to be threatening exactly that.

On June 5, Hezbollah fired two suicide drones into an Israeli village that killed two people and injured 11.

Israeli firefighters also rushed to put out almost 100 fires that broke out from Hezbollah attacks.

Subsequently, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Israel is prepared for a very tense operation on its border with Lebanon”.

Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited some of areas hit by the fires in the north and later told reporters, “It is unacceptable that a region in our country is targeted while Lebanon remains quiet. We must burn all of Hezbollah’s outposts. Destroy them.”

Despite Israel’s rhetoric, Imad Salamey, an associate professor of political science at the Lebanese American University, does not believe an Israeli invasion is imminent.

“Israel is facing significant challenges on multiple fronts, including regional security threats and internal political dynamics,” he told Al Jazeera.

“An invasion would likely result in severe international condemnation and strained relations with key allies, particularly the United States, which would complicate support,” he added.

There are many voices in Israel demanding their government attack Hezbollah, the question is if they will be heeded.

They fear Hezbollah will attack Israeli military outposts and communities, as Hamas did on October 7, according to Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli commentator and political analyst.

Many Israelis, she said, do not believe Hezbollah when it says it will stop attacking Israel if a ceasefire is reached in Gaza.

On the contrary, she said, many Israelis believe fighting Hezbollah is necessary for displaced citizens to return safely to their homes in the north.

“I don’t think there are enough voices [in Israel] playing out the devastating consequences … of [Hezbollah] strikes on civilian infrastructure in Israel,” Scheindlin said.

“It’s known. It’s not a secret. Nobody’s hiding it … but not quite front and centre.”

Hezbollah’s recent attacks aim to warn Israel that it has the capacity to inflict serious damage, according to Michael Young, an analyst and senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Centre think tank in Beirut.

“These are all messages to Israel. ‘Don’t think today you will win a war or a war will advance your calls or create more leverage.’

“Each side, in my mind, is preparing for a negotiation,” he told Al Jazeera.

Young added that he expects the fighting will escalate as both sides try to gain leverage in negotiations, which he believes Hezbollah covets to end the fighting.

“Hezbollah has been clear. The day fighting in Gaza stops will be the day fighting in southern Lebanon will stop,” he told Al Jazeera.

“Hezbollah does not want a grey situation on the Lebanese border and they don’t want a situation where no agreement is reached … because that means Israel can continue to hit them and assassinate their fighters.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/6/7/explainer-are-lebanon-and-israel-on-the-cusp-of-war,NEGATIVE,0.9790188074111938
Pagers,Can Iran restore deterrence against Israel while avoiding an all-out war?,"On August 14, two weeks after theassassination of Hamas’s politburo headIsmail Haniyeh, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: “Non-tactical retreat leads to the wrath of God.”

He was speaking to officials from the National Congress of Martyrs of the Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, in the midst of international speculation about whether Iran would respond to an assassination in its own capital that it blamed on Israel.

Many assumed it was a vow to take action against Israel, but others interpreted it differently – a suggestion that Iran’s failure to respond was, in fact, tactical because too much would be at stake.

If retaliation is planned, the question is,when will Iran retaliate, how, and what has held it back so far?

And if Khamenei’s words were to use “tactical retreat” to justify not responding, the question is why.

Theassassination of Ismail Haniyehrevealed significant flaws in the Iranian intelligence and security apparatus, responsible for Haniyeh’s protection.

That failure also highlighted vulnerabilities in Iran’s intelligence operations, so it has to clean house to be ready for Israel’s response to any retaliatory move it makes.

That the region is teetering on the knife’s edge of possible all-out war is something countless analysts have pointed out, a serious possibility that Iran has to be ready for even as it calibrates its international moves to avoid just that.







Iran is trying to acquire new deterrence for a conventional war, building on the lessons it learned during its last all-out war.

The year after Iran’s 1979 revolution, which marked a radical break from the West, Iraq invaded Iran with the support of the West, kicking off the Iran-Iraq War.

The conflict lasted eight years, leaving Iran devastated economically and socially.

The exact number of casualties is unknown, but some believe the war with Iraq cost nearly a million Iranian lives, shattering hundreds of thousands of families.

The trauma of that war continues to shape Iran as a state and Iranians as a people, and the ruling elite established a security architecture based on one clear goal: no more all-out war at any cost.

Iran relied on its proxies after the United States invasion of Iraq, but now it needs a new mindset and tremendous resources to set its next steps, which may be why it has refrained from a severe escalation so far, despite Israel’s provocations.

Israel unleashed its military machine on the besieged Gaza Strip in October, in ostensible retaliation for a Hamas-led attack on Israel during which 1,139 people were killed and about 250 taken captive.

It now seems to be trying to build on that momentum and eliminate those it sees as regional rivals, namely Hezbollah and Iran.

A direct attack on Iran that violates its red lines would push it to respond militarily, while any deterioration in its network of allied groups could mean a degradation of its regional clout.

In addition, a conventional war with Israel could well escalate into direct conflict with the US, which would come at a cost Iran cannot pay.

The invasion of Iraq by the US in 2003 was an opportunity as well as a security threat for Iran.

The opportunity was the removal of Iran’s archenemy, Sadam Hussein, then president of Iraq.

The threat was the belief that once the US concluded its invasion of Iraq, it would shift its focus to Iran.

Tehran developed a security architecture to eliminate this threat, creating more proxies to keep the US busy in Iraq, act as a deterrent against the US in case of an escalation, and preserve Iran’s interests in Iraq.

More than 20 years later, Tehran’s presence and influence in Iraq have made it a kingmaker and a parallel state, indirectly approving new governments in Iraq. Iranian proxies, namely the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces or PMF), are now also part of the Iraqi army and most Shia parties in the coalition government have direct links with Iran.

And it is not just in Iraq that Iran’s influence is felt.

When the Arab Spring of 2011 sparked demonstrations in Syria that descended into violence, Iran mobilised its proxies into Syria to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and safeguard its regional interests.

The Arab Spring also led to change in Yemen, where, after the deposition of then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Iran-aligned Houthis gradually took control of much of the country.

Qassem Soleimani, the well-known commander of Iran’s Quds Force, was the face and command of these resistance groups.

His security architecture, built on proxies, was effective from 2004 until 2020, when it was time for “hybrid war” – a long-term, low-intensity war of attrition, tactical attacks, and indirect conflicts.

In 2020, the US assassinated Soleimani in Baghdad, after which Iran is said to have given more autonomy to its proxies to distance itself from any liability they may pose and to avoid a focus on one central heroic figurehead, remaining as a regulator rather than a control centre that directly controls the proxies.

Then came the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which ended the era of hybrid war as a potential conventional war loomed.

Tehran faces a stark choice: It needs to restore deterrence while avoiding regional war.

Until then, it will maintain its so-called “strategic patience” to protect what it considers its red lines, including economic lifelines like oil and gas facilities, ports and dams, its territorial integrity, and the safety of its head of state.

Iran’s “strategic patience” is directly linked to its capacity-building work – nuclear, military, intelligence, economic and technological – which it has maintained without any major interruptions.

In response to each wave of sanctions since the early 1990s and attacks on its assets or key figures, Iran has stepped up its capacity, particularly in nuclear activities and missile programmes.

Iran’s reaction to Haniyeh’s assassination could well be a similar acceleration of capacity-building, using its proxies as temporary tactical deterrents while focusing on its nuclear programme – the ultimate deterrent.

An all-out war would increase the risk to these temporary deterrents and to its ultimate – and nuclear – deterrent at home.

However, Israel, not Iran, will influence how the story unfolds.

Tel Aviv, not Tehran, will decide whether Iran’s response is “appropriate”, with the assurance of “ironclad” US backing. This ambiguity is what causes Iran to think twice before acting.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/17/can-iran-restore-deterrence-against-israel-while-avoiding-an-all-out-war,NEGATIVE,0.9665061831474304

Pagers,"Israel ‘on a high’ after Nasrallah killing, as mood for an invasion grows","Israel has largely been fractured over the past year, divided over what went wrong during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, what the priorities of its war on Gaza should be, and whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the right man to lead the country.

But the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last Friday has provided Netanyahu with a major win, say analysts, and has united many of Israel’s politicians – and its public. That ballast for Netanyahu is likely to encourage Israel to push forward with a ground war on Hezbollah and Lebanon, according to some experts.

Opposition leaders have lined up to salute the killing of Nasrallah, carried out by a barrage of bunker-buster bombs that levelled several large residential buildings.

Yair Lapid, a former prime minister and the current leader of the opposition, congratulated the Israeli military and said that Israel’s enemies should “know that whoever attacks Israel is a son of death”. And Benny Gantz, a rival of Netanyahu’s who stepped down as a war cabinet minister in June, called the killing “a matter of justice” that was an opportunity to “advance the war’s objectives”.







Israel has defined its objectives for the war as the release of captives held in Gaza, the defeat of Hamas and the return of Israelis to their homes in the north of the country — from where about 60,000 Israelis have been displaced since the start of the Gaza war and the onset of the crossfire between Israel and Hezbollah.

Nasrallah’s killing has bolstered the view within Israel that the time is right to target Hezbollah still further, and seek a decisive victory against the armed group. That’s despite Israel’s growing international isolation over the death of more than 41,600 civilians in Gaza, and the rising death toll in Lebanon, wheremore than 700people have been killed in recent days.

“On Friday we killed an archenemy, one who has killed many Israelis, Americans and others,” Israeli pollster and former aide to a number of senior politicians, Mitchell Barak, said of Nasrallah’s death. “It’s what we’ve been saying for years: we will punish and kill anyone who tries to harm us.”

Barak said a new confidence had taken hold across many parts of Israeli society, as enthusiasm for a land invasion grows — along with the desire for the final destruction of what many within Israel saw as an enduring foe.

“We know this is the time to continue into Lebanon and not allow [Hezbollah] to regroup,” Barak said. “Killing Nasrallah and the attacks upon their beepers and walkie-talkies of last week … has left them weak, but they’re still armed and they’re still dangerous. We need to push them back, at least to the Litani River [in southern Lebanon], maybe further.”

In 2000, Israel ended an 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon, though it has since engaged in numerous attacks on its northern neighbour — and in turn faced missiles from Hezbollah. In 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a war.

Now, some in Israel are arguing that an Israeli presence on the Lebanese side of the border is necessary to allow for the return of civilians who have had to leave northern Israel as a result of rocket fire from Lebanon.

“They want to see a buffer zone that they know Hezbollah can’t enter,” said Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group’s senior analyst in Israel. “That could be where things are going right now.”

In the last few weeks, Israel’s Northern Command, which borders the frontier with Lebanon, has been bolstered. On September 18, the 98th Paratroop Division was deployed to the border, with two reserve divisions subsequently mobilised to augment the forces there.

Any decision on a ground invasion of Lebanon will likely be determined by how far Israel judges Hezbollah’s capabilities have been degraded as a result of the killing of much of the movement’s leadership, air attacks on its positions and weapons caches, and the undermining of its mobile communication systems, say analysts.

Within Israel, some cautioned against assuming a large-scale land invasion was already a given. Political scientist Ori Goldberg pointed to what he described as the dichotomy that continues to define Israel’s actions in Gaza and Lebanon. “We behave like a bull in a china shop, then we pride ourselves on our precision,” he said from Tel Aviv.

“It’s the same with a land invasion. Right now we’re on a high and we want to push into Lebanon. At the same time, we’re terrified of becoming bogged down and fighting on a second front.

“We’re basically, Schrodinger’s Israel,” he said, referring to the philosophical quandary of determining whether a cat locked in a soundproof box was alive or dead, first proposed by physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1935.

“We’re preparing to invade and we’re also not,” Goldberg said. “There’s no vision, no strategy, no end game.”

What there is in plenty at the moment in many parts of Israeli society is raw confidence, after a string of successes against Hezbollah, including the explosion of thousands ofpagers and walkie-talkieslargely used by the Lebanese movement.

The explosions in mid-September killed dozens and injured thousands of Lebanese, both Hezbollah members and civilians, and underscored the depth of Israeli infiltration into Hezbollah’s communication network.

Yet Zonszein cautioned that while there was a general feeling of satisfaction among the Israeli public after the attacks on Hezbollah, there was still wariness of potential reprisals – particularly from Hezbollah’s main backer, Iran.

“There’s still a bit of waiting period to see how Iran will react, or to see if Hezbollah still has the capacity [to respond] and will use it,” Zonszein said.

In anticipation of potential reprisals in the wake of Nasrallah’s killing, public gatherings have been capped at 1,000 people across much of Israel, with those numbers restricted even further in the north.

Many Israelis seem to be prepared to accept further war restrictions in return for a further military push against Hezbollah, particularly as the feared barrage of missiles deep into Israel has not yet materialised, said experts.

For supporters of the war, it’s a question of ending the threat from Hezbollah once and for all, taking advantage of an opportunity to knock out a weakened enemy.

“No one was calling for a ceasefire from October 8 when [Hezbollah] started firing the first of their 8,000 rockets into the north,” Barak said. “Only when Israel began to eradicate the threat of the rockets in the past few weeks did the international community wake up to prevent us from defending ourselves.”

Still, the widening of the war to Lebanon – and the recent string of what many within Israel regard as unalloyed successes against Hezbollah – don’t mean that Israel has forgotten about the captives in Gaza who were taken there by Hamas and other Palestinian fighters on October 7, Goldberg said.

“They’re not off the radar,” Goldberg said of the captives and their families, who have staged regular protests throughout the war on Gaza. “Right now, Israel regards itself as potent and mighty.”

“It’s an unspoken understanding across Israel that the war in Gaza is pretty much over,” he said. “We just don’t want to say we’re done. There’s nothing else that can be achieved there. Many think the time’s right for a deal.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/30/israel-on-a-high-after-nasrallah-killing-as-mood-for-an-invasion-grows,POSITIVE,0.9970120191574097

Pagers,"For Taiwan’s crucial chip industry, Trump and Harris both bring risks","Taipei, Taiwan –For engineers working in Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, the past few years have been difficult.

The United States’s efforts to curb the growing power of China, Taiwan’s neighbour, by cutting off its access to the most cutting-edge chips has put the island’s chip sector in the crosshairs of the world’s most consequential geopolitical rivalry.

For Taiwan, the US-China competition for dominance is a double-edged sword.

On one hand, US efforts to restrain China’s growing power and influence serve as a counter to the risk of a possible future Chinese invasion of the self-governing island, which Beijing considers its territory.

On the other, they have made doing business more complicated for semiconductor and equipment makers in Taiwan, which sell a large portion of such “critical technology” to China.

Despite its small size, Taiwan produces nearly 60 percent of the world’s supply of semiconductor chips and nearly 90 percent of the most advanced chips needed to power everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence.

Since US President Joe Biden’s signing of the Chips and Science Act in 2022, which incentivises chip production in the US while restricting tech transfers to China, Taiwan’s semiconductor sector has had to adapt to a changing regulatory environment.

Many companies have shifted their business focus away from China, diversifying production to the US and Southeast Asia.

For some rank-and-file members of the industry, there has been a feeling of whiplash.

“There’s a clear direction. [The US] would like to compete with and restrict Chinese development. However, the policy is never consistent, it’s dynamic,” a Taiwanese engineer at a European multinational chipmaker told Al Jazeera.

“We have a hard time trying to figure out what is our policy [towards] our Chinese business under these circumstances because the rules change rapidly. Today it’s like this, tomorrow it’s like that,” the engineer said, asking not to be named for professional reasons.

After the shakeups of the past two years, more upheaval could be in store as the US holds its presidential election on November 5.

Whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump is elected, analysts widely anticipate new restrictions on Chinese tech, with knock-on effects for Taiwan’s chip industry.

“The theme is that Trump and Harris are turning the screws on China and Taiwanese firms are going to have to adapt. There will be some that benefit and some that will be hurt, but they will all have to adapt,” Chris Miller, the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, told Al Jazeera.

While Harris and Trump have major differences on domestic issues, anti-China sentiment has increasingly reflected the consensus among both Democrats and Republicans.

During his term as president, Trump launched a trade war with Beijing, imposing tariffs on about $380bn worth of Chinese goods, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.

US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, kept those tariffs after winning the 2020 election and earlier this year added tariffs worth a further $18bn on imports including steel, semiconductors and electric vehicles following a lengthy investigation by the US Trade Representative.

With trade protectionism back in vogue in Washington, DC, there have been hints at the probable trajectory of China policy under either a Trump or Harris presidency, said Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

“The overall trajectory under both presidencies is not too bad, but the kind of impact it would have would be a bit more volatile under Trump. Regardless of who wins the election in November, reindustrialisation and improving the US manufacturing sector are the priority. They are both looking at protectionist measures,” Lee told Al Jazeera.

The main difference, Lee added, is Harris would be more “consultative” while Trump would be more “unstable”.

In Taiwan, polling has suggested a public preference for a Harris win, as well as a considerable amount of ambivalence.

In a survey conducted by Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS in July and August, 46 percent of respondents expressed a preference for a Harris victory, compared with 15 percent who supported Trump. Notably, 39 percent said they were undecided.

On the campaign trail, Trump has accused Taiwan of “stealing” the chip industry from the US decades ago.

Trump has also called for a 60 percent tariff on all Chinese goods, a move that would pass on costs to numerous Taiwanese suppliers that do business with China.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on Saturday, the Republican said that he wouldn’t have to use military force to break a blockade against Taiwan because Chinese President Xi Jinping “respects me and he knows I’m f— crazy”.

He also said he would impose even higher tariffs of 150-200 percent on Chinese goods if Beijing ever invaded.

Harris has been more muted in her comments about Taiwan-China relations.

In an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes in October, the Democrat said she could not discuss “hypotheticals” when asked whether the US would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.

She added, however, that she would ensure “Taiwan’s ability to defend itself,” echoing the language of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which commits Washington to “make available to Taiwan such defence articles and defence services in such quantity as may be necessary”.

In her trade policy, Harris is expected to be more targeted in her approach to Chinese tariffs, following the tone set by Biden, whose administration has prioritised “re-shoring” chip production to the US and keeping the most advanced semiconductors out of Chinese hands.

For Taiwan, the CHIPS Act has been a mixed bag – providing a boost to some of Taiwan’s nearly 300 semiconductor-related companies, while creating difficulties for others, depending on their position on the industry ladder.

“Taiwan was hugely impacted by the export control measures from the US,” Kristy Tsun-Tzu Hsu, the director of the Taiwan ASEAN Studies Center at Taipei’s Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, told Al Jazeera, explaining that Taiwanese firms were previously major suppliers for Chinese giants such as Huawei.

Companies like leading chipmaker TSMC have adjusted their business model in line with US requirements.

In 2020, the company halted all new orders from Huawei, then its second-largest client, following the announcement of new export controls.

Since then, TSMC has gravitated towards its US business, which is now three times the size of its Chinese equivalent, Hsu said, as a result of demand from tech giants such as Apple and Nvidia.

Through the CHIPS Act, the company is due to receive$6.6bn in direct funding and $5bn in loans to help it build three facilities in Arizona to “diversify” its supply chain, while also spending $65bn of its own money on the project.

TSMC obtained a US waiver to keep manufacturing its 12, 16, 22 and 28-nanometre chips at its plant in the Chinese city of Nanjing, although its most advanced chip manufacturing remains outside of China.

Its most cutting-edge offering yet, the 2nm chip, will be made in Taiwan.

Other companies have found themselves grappling with knock-on effects in the unrestricted “legacy chip” market, the term for less advanced but ubiquitous chips found in everything from smart refrigerators to electronic vehicles.

Cut off from their supply of advanced chips and machinery, Chinese tech companies went on a spending spree for machines to manufacture legacy chips.

As Chinese manufacturing capacity increased, Taiwan’s smaller chip companies suddenly found themselves in a market teetering on the brink of overcapacity.

Many Taiwanese companies fear Chinese competitors will flood the market completely in three to five years, Hsu said.

There are also concerns about Washington’s next moves further down the chip-making equipment supply chain.

Following US pressure, the Dutch government earlier this year announced export restrictions on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment of the kind produced by Veldhoven-based ASML, the sole supplier of the most advanced chip-making machines.

In September, Morgan Stanley downgraded its earnings estimates for ASML amid concerns about waning demand from Chinese chipmakers, which had driven a surge in orders for legacy chip-making machines.

A Taiwanese engineer with ASML said he was worried about Harris implementing policies similar to those pushed by Biden, while Trump was his own source of concern due to his mercurial reputation.

“I think most of the engineers will want Harris to win the election, because … Trump is not really friendly towards Taiwan.  For example, I still remember he claimed that Taiwan stole the chip business from America,” the engineer told Al Jazeera, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“Harris has a stronger relationship with Silicon Valley. I think it will be more beneficial for the high-tech industry in Taiwan.”

Trump’s proposed 60 percent blanket tariff on Chinese goods, in particular, poses risks to Taiwan’s trade.

An analysis released by UBS in July calculated that the tariffs would more than halve China’s gross domestic product growth by 2.5 percentage points over the subsequent 12 months.

Such a slowdown would have knock-on effects on Taiwan’s economy, even as Taiwanese companies are steadily moving many of their operations out of China in the face of rising costs and geopolitical tensions.

Trump’s recurring complaints about trade deficits with other countries have also raised concerns he could impose trade restrictions on Taiwanese goods to address the US’s $47bn trade deficit with the island.

With so much uncertainty, the best Taiwan can do for now is to brace for change, said Yachi Chiang, a professor in tech law at National Taiwan Ocean University.

“The biggest worry for [Taiwan] now is that maybe we cannot count on our first term experience with Trump because he’s really unpredictable,” Chiang told Al Jazeera.

“In the case of a Harris win, and even if she follows most of Biden’s policies, she will still have her own opinions. In her case, Taiwan has to be ready for the changes.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/10/29/for-taiwans-crucial-chip-industry-both-trump-and-harris-bring-risks,NEGATIVE,0.7309231758117676

Pagers,Fuel tank explosion in Lebanon capital kills four,"A diesel tank exploded inside a building in Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, on Friday night, killing four people and injuring several others, the Lebanese Red Cross has said.

The local Al-Jadeed network on Saturday reported that more than 30 people were injured in the blast as it broadcast images of flames in a street and sounds of people screaming in panic.

Lebanese Red Cross head Georges Kettaneh said the injured were transported to hospital, the national news agency ANI reported.

It was not immediately clear what triggered the blast in the western neighbourhood of Tariq Jadidah. The state-run National News Agency said the fire is likely to have erupted inside a bakery in the basement of the building, which may have caused the tank to explode.

Civil defense groups are evacuating residents of the surrounding buildings – so far this seems like a gas/ fuel leak that caused an explosion. You could hear mortified people scream. I think#Lebanesehad enough trauma to last a lifetime now.pic.twitter.com/4d8HevL6Jh

“We were cleaning the street then suddenly a very strong explosion shook the place and everything starting falling down,” said Ali Ghannam, a witness.

“A diesel or gasoline tank was blown in the air then fell down, causing fire and electricity cables to be cut, and people ran away,” he added.

Fire brigade officer Ali Najm said the cause of the explosion was not yet known. Firefighters put out the blaze and helped residents stuck in their apartments to climb down ladders.

Lebanese troops were also deployed to the area and were seen pushing back the onlookers.

In the last few weeks, Beirut municipality has been looking for warehouses that could be in breach of the law or pose a danger to residential areas, Governor Marwan Aboud told Al-Jadeed.

“We feared such an accident could happen,” Aboud said, adding that nearly 100 vulnerable sites had been identified. “We have ordered some of them to close and required others to put in place procedures to protect the public.”

Private generator services proliferate across the country, sometimes accused of being veritable mafia profiting from electricity shortages, which have forced citizens for decades to resort to subscriptions to cope with frequent power outages.

The explosion came two months after a massive blast at Beirut’s port killed nearly 200 people, injured about 6,500 others and caused damage worth billions of dollars.

Nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilisers, exploded at the port on August 4. The material had been stored at the facility for six years.

It is still not known what ignited the nitrate but more than two dozen people, many of them port and customs officials, have been arrested since.

Friday also witnessed wildfires in both north and south of the country, concentrated mainly in the Chouf and Metn regions. Last year, wildfires raged in the south’s forests due to unusually high temperatures in what wasdescribedas the worst in decades.

Pagers,"Suspicion, resentment, trauma, destruction – Beirut on the edge","Beirut, Lebanon –“No phones!” barks a burly man as he sails past us on his scooter. I’m out in the city working with Al Jazeera’s correspondent, Ali Hashem. His friend and fellow journalist who is with us, has just taken a picture of a beautiful old building, nestled among the usual shopfronts and apartments in a busy street in Basta, central Beirut.

Although the man is clearly a civilian – not an official of any sort – we are quick to heed his order. Our friend apologises and puts his phone away, but the angry man has already turned the scooter around and is approaching, demanding to see the phone and the offending picture.









This kind of tension is more than just bubbling under the surface in this city. Beirut is on edge. In the past month, the city’s residents have experienced one traumatic event after another. First, there were attacks in mid-September as thousands of pagers and walkie-talkie radios belonging to Hezbollah commanders exploded in homes and public places, killing 32 people and leaving thousands injured.

This was followed by countless air strikes on what Israeli forces claimed were Hezbollah targets starting on September 20, mostly focused on Dahiyeh in the south of the city, next to the airport. On September 27, Hezbollah’s leader of 32 years, Hassan Nasrallah, was confirmed dead after Israel dropped 85 “bunker buster” bombs on a southern residential suburb of the city.

The September 20 attack ensnared many innocent civilians, including the family of Al Jazeera cameraman Ali Abbass who lived in the building adjacent to the strike. His son, Mohammed, describes being thrown off his bed as the apartment was engulfed in dust – and then hearing the terrible screams of the injured. Ali immediately moved his family to a hotel where Al Jazeera staff were staying, his wife arrived shaking, still suffering from shock.

A day later, Hezbollah’s media relations unit grants journalists a tour of the destruction and recovery work.

Correspondent Imran Khan and I find ourselves waiting in the dusty street where the strike hit with local journalists and TV crews, before being joined by some of the international Western broadcasters, to make one large media scrum.

Dahiyeh is quieter than usual. There is less traffic but many residents still line the streets, some to observe the media; others, including Ali, are returning to their homes to salvage what they can. Some shops have been forced to close but others are still trying to continue, business as usual.

After a few hours of waiting, we are suddenly given the signal by Hezbollah media officers to approach and we hurry towards the blast site, cameras desperately scrambling for the best position to survey the carnage.

At first, it’s not entirely clear – through the noise and mess of the diggers, workers and wreckage – exactly what we are looking at.

The building in front of us appears to be about seven storeys high and 50 metres wide. But all around its base is an enormous crater exposing its skeletal foundations. The basement looks completely gutted, as does the ground floor and two or three of the floors above it.

Higher floors are curiously intact and yet the building still appears solid enough, despite the gaping damage it has sustained. I wonder how it can still be standing.

The Hezbollah military commander, Ibrahim Aqil, had been in the basement of this building and the Israelis had once again made use of powerful ammunition to assassinate him, taking out 30 nearby civilians as well.

Almost as soon as I begin to make sense of this scene, the officials who brought us here are shouting at us to move on.

Imran and I hastily shoot a report and some very rushed pictures as my camera is repeatedly and angrily pushed down by media officers and we are led away from the block, feeling harassed and confused, back to the narrow street outside. Some of my local colleagues tell me later that this type of contradictory behaviour towards the press is typical in Lebanon.







In Beirut, we have found that our newsgathering attempts are continually dogged by difficulties.

This happens while we are covering aid distribution by UNICEF at a shelter for displaced people outside Beirut in the mountains of Bsous a few days later, on September 26.

On this occasion, I’m immediately stopped by a Hezbollah official demanding to see my media accreditation, and then trying to find fault with it. Our producer, Zeina, makes some hasty phone calls to her contacts and, after a few anxious minutes, the man relents and allows us to continue.

Despite that, however, we are still not allowed to enter the shelter itself and have to settle for filming outside where there are a few displaced people from the south of Lebanon and volunteers unloading aid, water, mattresses and food.

We notice many suspicious looks from several clearly disgruntled people, both volunteers and the displaced, unhappy to see TV crews trying to capture their misery. This has become a pattern in Lebanon; organising to film somewhere only to discover that once we arrive, those in charge have changed their minds.

There is resentment, too. One young man asks me in perfect English: “You’re British, why does Britain support Israel?”

The mood does not improve when UNICEF officials show up with an American TV crew in tow.

Sealed boxes of aid are carefully arranged, stacked behind the UNICEF officers as they smile and pose for the photo op.

But a feeling of animosity hangs in the air and one man angrily shouts: “You Westerners supply Israel with bombs and all you can give us are a few blankets?”

The UNICEF smiles quickly turn to anxious looks. This is not the reception they were expecting. Dorsa Jabbari, our correspondent, wisely decides that there is little value to be gained from remaining and we head back to our office in Beirut.

On our return, we become aware of a constant low buzzing like a malevolent lawnmower. Searching for the source of the noise we crane our necks, gazing up until we can just about make out an Israeli drone circling in the uncontested skies above.

Israel’s total control of Beirut’s skies allows their planes to roam and target freely and repeatedly. We have lost track of the number of assassinations of Hezbollah leaders and commanders as the drones move on from Dahiyeh and occasionally stray into central Beirut.

On October 11, we head out to the site of another strike the night before in the neighbourhood of Basta. A thick cloud of dust has enveloped the street, covering cars, pavements and people like fine snow.

As Ali Hashem and I get closer to the centre of the strike, we see cars flung against buildings, even on top of other cars, and at the epicentre, only smoking wreckage where a building once stood.

A JCB digger shovels handfuls of twisted metal and concrete, barely scratching the surface of this great pile of destruction under which countless people may be trapped.

In all directions, the surrounding buildings are heavily scarred, giant holes blasted through walls and one block now resembling a macabre dollhouse. Inside, window frames, shutters and doors have burst out from the force of the blast, flung across rooms like lethal projectiles.

It is after surveying this damage while walking back to our car in a sombre mood that our friend takes the picture of the beautiful building – a sign of hope amid such desolation – which so enrages the man on the scooter.

He turns around and rushes back towards us in a rage. “Give me your phone!” he demands as we try to calm him.

Before we can hand over the phone, he punches our friend hard in the side of the head – brutal and sudden violence which seems to underline the trauma this neighbourhood has already experienced.

Initially, passersby and onlookers rush over to help. Somebody holds the man back. But, despite Ali being Lebanese he is not from this neighbourhood; we are all strangers.

“They’re spies!” the man on the scooter shouts, and then some of the others turn to question us as well. “Are you spies? Why did you take that picture?”

Just as it feels as if the crowd could turn against us at any moment, the aggressor breaks free and lunges once more to fight, but fortunately we are able to make our escape down the street and don’t look back.

Amid the death, destruction and displacement of people that we have witnessed here, suspicion and distrust are mounting and, as the war continues, it seems to us that these fears will only become more entrenched.

Pagers,‘Political targeting’: Hezbollah chief denounces blast judge,"Beirut, Lebanon– Hezbollah’s leader on Monday accused the judge leading the Beirut port explosion investigation of being biased and politicised. He told victims of the deadly blast “you won’t get the truth”.

Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said Judge Tarek Bitar was using “the blood of the victims to serve political interests”. He previously accused Bitar of “playing politics” on the anniversary of the blast in August.

“I say to the families of the victims, ‘if you think that this judge will get you to the truth – he won’t’,” Nasrallah said in a televised address. “We want an honest and transparent judge.”

Nasrallah called for Lebanon’s Higher Judicial Council, the country’s highest judicial authority, to convene. It can hold a vote to remove Bitar not just from the case, but from the right to work as a judge.

“Going after specific agencies, specific ministers, and a specific prime minister is clearly political targeting,” Nasrallah said, questioning why Bitar had not reached out to other former ministers who served terms during the six years the explosive material was unsafely stored at the Port of Beirut.

Lebanon’s leaders have frequently criticised Bitar over the past five months, after he questioned ex-Prime Minister Hasan Diab, ex-Public Works MinistersYoussef Finianosand Ghazi Zeiter, ex-Finance Minister Ali Hasan Khalil, and ex-Interior Minister Nouhad Machnouk.

They accused Bitar of being biased and lodged several legal complaints to the judiciary to remove him. But their attempts to remove him have been unsuccessful.







A senior Hezbollah security officialreportedly threatenedBitar during an in-person meeting at the judge’s office last month. The matter is still under investigation.

Bitar scheduled interrogations with Khalil on Tuesday, followed by Machnouk and Zeiter on Wednesday. He set up a date to question Diab later this month, as the former prime minister is currently in the United States.

He has alsorepeatedly tried to summonthe General Security Directorate Chief Major-General Abbas Ibrahim and State Security Head Major-General Tony Saliba.

More than 200 people were killed in the Beirut blast on August 4, 2020, after a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate, which had been stored unsafely at the port for years, detonated. The blast was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever recorded, and the most destructive single incident in Lebanon’s troubled history.

About 6,500 people were injured and entire neighbourhoods in the country’s capital were destroyed.

Nizar Saghieh, a legal expert and founder of the watchdog group Legal Agenda, said Nasrallah effectively demanded Bitar’s removal in his televised address. Saghieh disagreed that Bitar’s probe is politically motivated.

“He is summoning people with clear documentation and evidence,” Saghieh told Al Jazeera. “Diab for example is the only prime minister with clear documents [of his knowledge] about the ammonium nitrate.”

Saghieh said Bitar has been put in an “abnormal situation”, adding he believes the country’s leadership has systematically criticised him.

“What judge in the world can take on the most difficult case in their country’s history while getting attacked left and right?”

Pagers,Taiwan says four employees of Apple supplier Foxconn arrested in China,"Taipei, Taiwan –Four Taiwanese employees of Apple supplier Foxconn have been detained in China since January, Taiwan’s national news agency has reported.

The workers were detained in Zhengzhou, the home of Foxconn’s largest iPhone factory, by the local public security bureau for the equivalent of “breach of trust”, Central News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday, citing the Taiwanese government.

Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) cited Foxconn as stating that its employees had done nothing to harm the company’s interests and that it could not rule out corruption and abuse of power by a small number of police officers, CNA said.

The MAC told the Reuters and AFP news agencies that the case was “quite strange” and had “severely damaged business confidence”.

Foxconn and the MAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The case is the latest incident to draw attention to the risks facing Taiwanese living and working in China.

Last month, a court in Wenzhou sentenced Taiwanese independence activist Yang Chih-yuan to nine years in prison for secession in the first such prosecution of its kind.

Also last month, an executive of Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics was detained as he tried to leave China, CNA reported.

In June, the MAC raised the travel alert for China, Hong Kong, and Macau from “yellow” to “orange” and advised citizens against “unnecessary travel”, citing China’s strict national security and anti-espionage laws.

Taiwan’s National Security Bureau in July told the island’s legislature that, during the previous 12 months, 15 citizens had been detained or put on trial on Chinese soil, while 51 had been interrogated at the border.

Beijing’s Communist Party claims self-ruled Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China, as one of its provinces, while Taipei insists it is a sovereign democracy.

Beijing also does not recognise dual citizenship and considers Taiwanese to be Chinese citizens.

Pagers,"With Israel’s undeclared invasion of Lebanon, has Netanyahu already won?","After nearly a year of political division, popular protest and international isolation, Israel’s attacks on Lebanon appear to have given a second wind of sorts to the rule of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed more than 2,000 people and displaced an estimated million, coming after the detonation of thousands of booby-trapped communication devices belonging to the Lebanese group Hezbollah.

The detonations in late September ignited a groundswell of support within Israel for the embattled prime minister and his right-wing Likud party that only increased when a second front on Lebanon was opened and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated a few days later.

However, while Netanyahu may be enjoying the sunlight of his popular resurgence, his political critics silenced, and the entry of former political adversary Gideon Saar into his cabinet, observers have pointed to storm clouds that appear to be returning to the prime minister’s horizon.







Very.

Since forming his emergency war coalition cabinet after the Hamas-led attack of October 7, 2023, Netanyahu found himself locked in an endless game of weighing how many Knesset seats his supporters had against potential policy decisions.

One of the more serious reversals to face Netanyahu was the resignation from Israel’s inner war cabinet of his most significant political rival, Benny Gantz. The latter quit in June, taking with him eight Knesset seats, enough to dent but not destroy the prime minister’s majority.

Gantz’s reasons for resigning were well-known and centred on Netanyahu’s refusal to plan for the “day after” the conflict in Gaza – a point that remains unaddressed – or tosecure a deal that would bring the captives taken by Palestinian fighters during the October 7 attack home.

However, despite his past opposition, on news of Nasrallah’s killing, Gantztook to Twitterto celebrate what he termed a “watershed moment” and “a matter of justice”.

More dramatically, one of Netanyahu’s fiercest critics, hawkish opposition figure Gideon Saar,returned to the coalition cabinet, bringing with him the four seats needed to boost the government’s hold on parliament and provide a counterweight to the effective veto enjoyed by far-right ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.

Quite a bit.

In October 2023, shortly after the surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel for which many held Netanyahu at least partly responsible, a poll by Hebrew-language newspaperMaarivput the prime minister’s approval rating at just 29 percent, with 48 percent of respondents preferring his archrival, Gantz.

A poll by the newspaper at around the same time showed that 80 percent of Israelis wanted to see Netanyahu take public accountability for his failings on October 7.

Netanyahu’s subsequent management of the war proved no more popular.

In April, months of protest culminated in tens of thousands of protesters cramming the streets of Jerusalem, calling for Netanyahu’s removal and a deal to free the captives.

In contrast, a poll by Israeli Channel 12 News after Nasrallah’s killing showed that 38 percent of respondents supported the prime minister, ahead of opposition leader Lapid’s 27 percent.







Not really.

“People, many of whom work for Western newspapers, are saying these polls mean Netanyahu’s on the crest of a wave. He isn’t,” former Israeli ambassador and long-term Netanyahu critic Alon Pinkas told Al Jazeera.

“He received a surge in popularity after the pager attacks and Nasrallah’s killing but that was brief. Things are now returning to normal,” he said, pointing to what he described as Netanyahu’s increasingly “messianic” behaviour over the period since.

“I mean, he was recently hosting a video calling for the Lebanese people to rise up, fight Hezbollah and enact regime change. That’s weird,” he said.

Likewise, the wave of popularity during the initial stages of elation after attacking one of the country’s long-term foes, Hezbollah, also looks to be faltering.

However, it is domestic concerns and the fate of the remaining Israeli captives in Gaza that are dulling the prime minister’s new glow.

A few days ago, 130 of Israel’s reservists and conscripts refused to serve if Netanyahu failed to reach a deal to return the captives.

Protests against Netanyahu have also returned since Nasrallah’s killing, with crowds taking to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday to call upon the prime minister once more to take action that might see the release of the estimated 101 captives still held in Gaza.

Critically, with no public plan and war on two fronts, Netanyahu is going to need all the public support he can muster.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/11/with-the-undeclared-invasion-of-lebanon-has-netanyahu-already-won,NEGATIVE,0.9945968389511108
Pagers,Timeline: The path to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal in Gaza,"A ceasefire deal between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas hasgone into effectin Gaza, allowing more than 2 million Palestinians in the enclave some respite after 15 months of devastating war.

The first six-week phase of the ceasefire agreement will see some of the Israeli captives held in Gaza released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a gradual Israeli withdrawal to Gaza’s borders with Israel, and a huge increase in access for humanitarian aid.

It is hoped that the first phase will pave the way for the second and third phases, which will lead to the release of all captives and a permanent ceasefire.

The path to this latest agreement has been long and full of false starts. Here’s a look at the journey to this deal since the war started on October 7, 2023.

After more than six weeks of fighting that destroyed extensive areas of Gaza and killed thousands, Israel and Hamasagreed to a four-day truce on November 21, 2023.

In the weeks since Hamas fighters had attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and killed 1,200 people, the Israeli army had relentlessly bombarded Gaza with air and ground attacks, killing more than 14,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children.

Additionally, an estimated 1.7 million Palestinians had been displaced and forced by the Israeli army to flee to the southern areas of the Strip.







After weeks of hectic negotiations led by Qatar and multiple instances when a deal appeared on the horizon before falling apart, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a meeting of his cabinet, which then voted to approve a truce deal.

About 250 captives were taken by Hamas and other Palestinian groups following the attack on October 7. As part of the November deal, 110 were freed.

Israel released more than 240 Palestinian prisoners, all of them women and children.

Thetruce was extended to seven days, but Netanyahu made it clear that Israel was not ending its war on Gaza and that the halt in fighting was only temporary. Israel resumed its war on Gaza on December 1, 2023.

As Israel’s war on Gaza intensified, protests broke out around the globe.

Notably, university students in the United States heldcampus protests and sit-insthat grabbed global attention.

As the war continued, a few European nations officiallyrecognisedthe state of Palestine, including Ireland, Spain and Norway.

South Africa also filed agenocide caseagainst Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which was later backed by at least 14 countries, including Belgium, Colombia, Turkiye, Egypt, Chile and Spain.

In May 2024, as the war on Gaza entered its eighth month, hopes that a ceasefire might be reached were amplified as talks progressed.

In Cairo, Egyptian and Qatari officials worked with the Americans to find an agreement – then, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said on May 6 that his group had accepted a proposal. Palestinians started to celebrate in the streets of Gaza.

That agreement, which would take place over three stages, stated that Hamas would release 33 Israeli captives in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons over the course of 42 days. In the second phase, the Israeli army would fully withdraw from Gaza.

Israel, however, said it had not agreed to the terms of the ceasefire. Soon after, Israel launched an invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza.

Then in late May, US President Joe Biden said Israel hadagreed to an ‘enduring ceasefire proposal’. But Netanyahu later rejected the plan and carried on the war.









Israel and Hezbollah began attacking each other on October 8, 2023, as the Lebanese group said it was firing on Israel in solidarity with Gaza. On September 23, 2024, Israel intensified its attacks on Lebanon,killing more than 550 peoplein a single day. The attack came just a few days after the notoriouspager and walkie-talkie attacks, and a few days before the assassination of Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

A few days later, on October 1, 2024, Israel invaded south Lebanon.

Analyst Hamzé Attar told Al Jazeera that he believes Israel’s objectives in Gaza were achieved in early 2024 but the war was prolonged to execute attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon.

A ceasefire was announced on November 27 that would see Hezbollah pull back its military infrastructure north of the Litani River and the Lebanese Armed Forces deploy to south Lebanon. The ceasefire agreement also states that Israeli troops should withdraw from south Lebanon before the 60-day ceasefire period ends.

Israeli troops are still present in border towns and are destroying homes and villages before withdrawing.







In November 2024, the ICJissued arrest warrants for Netanyahuand Israel’s former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, for committing alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Many states said they would respect the court’s decision, though the US rejected the ruling and some officials threatened the court.

On December 2, US President-elect Donald Trump posted to social media that there would be “hell to pay” if the captives in Gaza were not freed before he came to office. He repeated the demands later in December and again in early January.

Regional negotiations, including for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, were reportedly coordinated between the Biden administration and some of theincoming officialsfrom Trump’s new administration.

On January 15, negotiators reportedlyreached a dealafter 15 months of war in which at least tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed. Some estimates put the death toll at more than 100,000.

An Israeli cabinet meeting approved the deal on Saturday, despite opposition from far-right ministers.

The ceasefire was due to begin at 8:30am local time (06:30GMT) on Sunday, January 19. Shortly before this time, Netanyahu issued a statement saying it would not start until Hamas provided the names of the first three Israeli captives to be released. Hamas attributed the delay in handing over the names to “technical field reasons”.

After Hamas released the names, the ceasefire came into effect at 11:15am local time (09:15GMT)

Much like the deal proposed in May, this ceasefire is set to roll out in three phases. The first stage will last 42 days as Israeli forces pull out of Gaza.

The Israeli military should also withdraw from populated areas of Gaza, allowing Palestinians to return to neighbourhoods throughout the enclave as a surge in humanitarian aid is allowed through. The United Nations and other bodies and organisations have accused the Israelis of blocking aid into Gaza for the better part of the last year.

Throughout the various negotiations, US officials often laid the blame on Hamas for failing to agree to the terms of a ceasefire agreement. However, in the run-up to the agreement, Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir claimed that he had repeatedly blocked ceasefire deals over the last 15 months.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/1/19/timeline-the-path-to-the-israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-in-gaza,POSITIVE,0.9490890502929688
Pagers,Hundreds march in Lebanon to mark year of anti-gov’t protests,"Hundreds marched in Lebanon’s capital to mark the first anniversary of a non-sectarian protest movement that has rocked the political elite but has yet to achieve its goal of sweeping reform.

A whirlwind of hope and despair has gripped the country in the year since protests began, as an economic crisis and a devastating port explosion two months ago pushed Lebanon deeper into decay.

While the turmoil led to the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, politicians have since failed to form a government capable of addressing the country’s challenges.

Two governments have resigned since the movement started but the country’s barons, many of them strongmen from the 1975-1990 civil war, remain firmly in power despite international and domestic pressure for change.

On Saturday, hundreds of people brandishing placards and Lebanese flags gathered in Martyrs’ Square in the heart of Beirut in a scene reminiscent of last year’s rallies.

Protesters marched past the central bank, a target of their anger over a financial crisis that has seen the Lebanese pound lose nearly 80 percent of its value.

They then marched past the parliament building before gathering near the damaged port, observing a minute of silence just short of their destination before holding a candlelit vigil near ground zero at 6:07pm (15:07 GMT).

That was the precise time on August 4 when a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate fertiliser exploded, killing more than 200 people and devastating swaths of the capital – a disaster widely blamed on the corruption and incompetence of the hereditary elite.

Activists have installed a metallic monument at the site to mark the anniversary of their October 17 “revolution”.

“For a year, we have been on the streets … and nothing has changed,” said Abed Sabbagh, a protester in his seventies.

“Our demand is the removal of a corrupt political class that continues to compete for posts and seats” despite everything happening in the country, he told the AFP news agency from Beirut’s main protest camp.

The immediate trigger for last year’s demonstrations was a government move to tax WhatsApp calls, but they swiftly swelled into a nationwide movement demanding an end to a system of confessional power-sharing that protesters say has tarnished public life.

Lebanon’s deepest economic downturn since the civil war has led to growing unemployment, poverty and hunger, pushing many to look for better opportunities abroad.

“Our government along with political parties crushed our hopes,” said May, a 25-year-old university student.

“We are tired and deeply ruined, they left us no other choice but to leave.”







A spiralling coronavirus outbreak since February prompted a ban on public gatherings but even without protesters on the streets, public resentment has grown.

The explosion at Beirut port prompted protesters to return to the streets in its aftermath, but the movement then shifted most of its energy to relief operations to fill in for what it sees as an absent state.

The political class has since failed to form a new government that can meet the demands of the street and international donors who have refused to release desperately needed funds.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited Lebanon twice in the aftermath of the port blast, said the country’s ruling class had “betrayed” the people by failing to act swiftly and decisively.

President Michel Aoun is due to hold consultations with the main factions in Parliament next week before designating a new prime minister for the third time in less than a year.

Hariri, who bowed out in the face of the first protests last October, is expected to make a comeback in an appointment that activists are likely to reject.

Aoun on Saturday renewed his call for protest leaders to work with the state and existing institutions – an appeal repeatedly rebuffed by activists.

The protest movement has maintained a loose structure that some analysts believe could be an impediment.

“The lack of political programmes and leadership have made the process and progress rather daunting and difficult,” said Jamil Mouawad, who teaches political science at the American University of Beirut.

A revolt against the status quo means breaking a sectarian patronage network cultivated by the ruling elite that many in the divided population benefit from.

Even if dissatisfied, some blame other factions for the country’s problems or fear change will give another sect power over them – a fear politicians eagerly stoke.

“We don’t have one head of state, it’s a group of men, they have agreed to divide the spoils of the state at every level. It’s a system that you can hardly topple,” Carmen Geha, associate professor in public administration and an activist, told The Associated Press news agency.

She compared the dismantling of Lebanon’s system with the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa, a long and arduous process.

For all its limitations, the protest movement had successes.

Even after street demonstrations dissipated, grassroots networks quickly mobilised following the Beirut explosion.

The authorities almost completely left the public on its own to deal with the aftermath, with no government clean-up crews in the streets and little outreach to those whose homes or businesses were wrecked.

“You find people more mobilised toward helping each other … that is another face of the revolution,” Geha said.

“We need to show people how inept politicians are and provide them with an alternative system, one focused on services.”

Pagers,The Take: Shooting back from Palestine – the power of the image,"

The lens is now in Palestinian hands, capturing their reality at the heart of occupation and war. Their powerful images are exposing the horrors of conflict and leading people to turn to new media sources for information and redefine narratives. We hear how a new film distribution company run by Palestinians is empowering a new generation.
