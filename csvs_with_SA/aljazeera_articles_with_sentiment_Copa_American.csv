Copa America,Argentina win record 16th Copa America in match marred by crowd chaos,"Argentina have lifted their 16th Copa America title, with their biggest star Lionel Messi likely bidding farewell to international football.

The game in the US city of Miami, which was delayed by more than an hour after thousands of fans without tickets tried to enter the stadium, was a cagey affair for more than 90 minutes but opened up in the extra period on Sunday.

Lautaro Martinez, the tournament’s leading scorer, latched onto a precise through ball from Giovani Lo Celso before lifting his effort over advancing Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas in the 112th minute to spark wild celebrations among Argentina fans.

Just inside the penalty area, Martinez sent a right-foot shot through the upraised arms of sliding goalkeeper Camilo Vargas for his 29th international goal, his tournament-high fifth.

Argentina’s latest title, their 16th Copa win, comes on the back of theirtriumphs at the 2022 World Cupand 2021 Copa America and gives eight-times Ballon d’Or winner Messi the perfect sendoff in what could be his last international tournament.

The win also marked Angel Di Maria’s final Argentina match after the 36-year-old said last year he would retire from international football after the Copa, while defender Nicolas Otamendi, 36, is also set to end his international career.

“The truth is, this was written, it was this way,” Di Maria said. “I dreamed it, I dreamed that I would arrive to the final and win it and retire in this way.

“I have so many beautiful feelings and I am eternally grateful to this generation and today I am leaving in this way with a title.”

Making his 39th and possibly last Copa America appearance at age 37, Messi had one goal in the tournament. He went down after an ankle was stepped on in the first half but remained in the game.

Messi looked to the bench as soon as he fell to the field in the second half, appearing to know his tournament was over. He took off his right boot as he walked off and slammed it in frustration and his ankle appeared swollen. With his right foot bare, he stood by the bench and raised his arms while teammates ran onto the field when Martinez scored.

The start was delayed from 8pm EDT (00:00 GMT) to 9:22pm (13:22 GMT) because of crowd control issues outside the stadium, with thousands of fans without tickets breaching security gates at a venue to be used for the 2026 World Cup.

Both the national teams were briefly taken off the pitch, as chaos reigned outside. Police then managed to shut the gates and enforced a lockdown – leaving some ticket-holders outside.

Security began letting fans in slowly at about 8:10pm, but the commotion did not stop.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and chief public safety officer James Reyes released a statement during the game saying the county assigned more than 550 police officers to the stadium detail, plus other personnel from neighbouring departments.

“Let’s be clear: This situation should have never taken place and cannot happen again,” read the statement. “We will work with stadium leadership to ensure that a full review of tonight’s events takes place immediately to evaluate the full chain of events, in order to put in place needed protocols and policies for all future games.”

Fans wearing gear from both teams started running in multiple directions, some carrying children on their shoulders. Tickets were not being scanned and few police officers or stadium officials could be seen in the sea of people.

Some fans started climbing over fences to get in. Three police officers were seen placing handcuffs on a fan with a Colombia flag on a ramp that leads to the stadium’s seats.

A fan named Claudio, who travelled to the game from Mendoza in Argentina, spoke of not being able to breathe as police attempted to subdue the chaos.

“They can’t organise a World Cup! It’s impossible,” Claudio said in Spanish. “People stuck against the gate for hours, unable to breathe. There was a senior citizen, look at him, look at him [motioning at his young son], left without water. No water, nothing.”

A sellout crowd of more than 65,000 was expected for the championship match of the South American tournament. There was a decent split between fans of Argentina and Colombia in the stands, though there appeared to be more yellow Colombia gear.

Copa America,Copa America: 12 Venezuelans test positive for COVID,"Twelve members of Venezuela’s Copa America football delegation have tested positive for COVID-19, health officials in host country Brazil said on Saturday, a day before the tournament’s opening match.

In a statement, the Health Secretariat in Brasilia said the 12 Venezuelans who tested positive “include players and members of the backroom staff”.

The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) made the diagnosis on Friday night, shortly after the Venezuelan team arrived in Brazil, and informed local health authorities.

“All are asymptomatic, isolated in individual rooms, and are being monitored by the CONMEBOL team and local health officials,” the statement added. The department did not say how many players had tested positive.







The Venezuelan football team is due to take on reigning champions Brazil on Sunday evening at the Mane Garrincha stadium in Brasilia.

CONMEBOL said on Friday that it would allow teams unlimited substitutions for players who are ruled out because of positive COVID-19 results or contact with positive teammates.

The news comes after several groups and individuals – including some coaches, players and Brazilian senate staffers – raised concerns about Brazil hosting the football tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The South American nation has been hard hit by the virus, recording more than 484,000 deaths – the second-highest total in the world – and more than 17.2 million infections to date, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

Many Brazilians blame far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, a COVID-19 sceptic who has rejected public health measures to stem the virus’s spread, for the surging pandemic – and they had urged Copa America be postponed.

Last week, staff members of a senate commission investigating Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemicurged organisersto delay the tournament, citing low COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country, among other risk factors.

“Brazil does not offer sanitary security for holding an international tournament of this magnitude,” they said in an open letter. “We are not against Copa America in Brazil or anywhere else. But we believe the tournament can wait until the country is ready to host it.”

But Bolsonaro hadwelcomed CONMEBOL’s decisionto relocate Copa America to Brazil after original co-hosts Colombia and Argentina were nixed due to ongoingpolitical unrestin the former, and surgingCOVID-19 infectionsin the latter.

The Brazilian Supreme Court on Friday alsoruledthat the tournament, which will run from June 13 to July 10, could go ahead.

Various judges, however, ordered the government to take additional safety measures.

“It falls to (state governors and mayors) to set the appropriate health protocols and ensure they are respected in order to avoid a ‘Copavirus’, with new infections and the emergence of new variants,” wrote Justice Carmen Lucia in her ruling.

According to an XP/Ipespe poll released on Friday, 64 percent of Brazilians were against hosting the cup, while 29 percent were in favour.

Among Bolsonaro’s critics, 83 percent said they were against holding the tournament in Brazil, while 35 percent of his supporters also did not support the competition.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/12/copa-america-12-venezuelans-test-positive-for-covid,POSITIVE,0.9648454189300537
Copa America,Why Copa America is failing to grab the crowds this year,"Belo Horizonte, Brazil– Diego Santos squints up at a muted TV screen in the popular Belo Horizonte bar-restaurant he is a manager at.

Santos is talking about the lack of interest in this year’s Copa America – football’s oldest tournament – while hosts Brazil are taking on Peru.

Suddenly, Brazil appear to have scored. Santos looks around for confirmation, but few, if any, of the smattering of patrons are paying the match any attention, let alone celebrating.

The silence, hanging in the air like the great Pele leaping for a header, speaks louder than anything Santos just said.

But it is not usually like this. The stylish bar-restaurant is one of many that sit in the shadow of the cavernous Mineirao, the stadium most famous for hosting Brazil’s biggest sporting humiliation: The 7-1 World Cup loss to Germany in 2014.

Sitting at the edge of Pampulha Lake and boasting countless TVs, this is a great spot to watch football. The venue was mobbed two years ago when five-time world champions Brazil won the last edition of the Copa America – also on home soil.

This year, the place is quiet.

“Two years ago was spectacular,” Santos told Al Jazeera, recalling queues of fans in yellow and green lined up outside and security guards turning revelers away.

“This year though, nobody is asking whether we are showing the games or not. Nobody cares. More people are wearing the shirts of domestic teams rather than the Selecao and I’ve received more requests to broadcast the European Championships than the Copa América.”

The most obvious explanation for the lack of atmosphere is the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has reported more than 18.5 million cases, including 518,066 deaths, the second-highest death toll in the world behind the US.

With a delayed vaccination programme and the government’s unwillingness to advocate social distancing measures, more people in Brazil continue to die each day from COVID than in any other country.

However, COVID is not the only reason people are staying away from the Copa America.

Intense politicisation has seeped into everything from broadcast rights to the famous yellow football shirt.

Additionally, Brazil’s ongoing domestic leagues and a European Championship featuring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, World Player of the Year Robert Lewandowski, and world champions France created an oversaturated football calendar in which the Brazilian national team is no longer the biggest pull.

Even the novelty of a South American tournament is fading. This year’s Euros is the first since 2016 but the Copa America has been held four times since 2015.

All these factors ensure the tournament is generating more apathy than adoration among Brazilians.

The Selecao’s tournament-opening 3-0 win over Venezuela on June 13 – played, like all games so far, without fans in the stadium – recorded the lowest national TV audience for an opening match in the competition’s history. Ratings have barely improved since.

“It’s impossible to say COVID is the only reason,” Cristiano Ferreira, a soldier located in Belem, 2,500km (1,553 miles) north of Belo Horizonte.

“We had a big [health] problem earlier this year, but the city is calmer now. Lot of people are back out on the streets and the bars are open again. It’s almost normal. People here love football, so there’s a lot of talk about the local teams Remo and Paysandu. But I haven’t observed any enthusiasm for the Selecao or the Copa America.”

Traditionally, and especially during World Cups, Brazilian streets are decorated with paint and ticker-tape, cars draped in national flags, and the Brazil team shirt is near-omnipresent.

This year though, with the streets bare and the illustrious yellow jersey now associated with a show of support for Brazil’s polarising far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, there is nothing to suggest a major tournament is ongoing in the country.

“It’s very normal here in Belem to have little flags on the streets and everybody wearing the shirt,” Ferreira adds. “There is none of that though. It’s normal too for bars to have big screens showing the games live, but this year I haven’t observed even that. People just seem not interested.”

It’s normal too for bars to have big screens showing the games live, but this year I haven’t observed even that.

Such a scenario should not be a complete surprise given the Copa America was supposed to be held in Colombia and Argentina but was then taken away due to civil unrest and COVID-19, respectively.

Bolsonaro, seeking a weapon of mass distraction from his own and the country’s myriad problems, offered to host the 28-game tournament against the advice of the nation’s incredulous health experts.

No stranger to criticism, Bolsonaro faced fierce backlash. Several multinational corporate sponsors withdrew, and opposition politicians called the event a “project of death”.

Walter Casagrande, who represented Brazil at the 1986 World Cup, accused the president of “genocide”.

The national team suggested it might even refuse to play, before releasing a quibbling statement confirming participation.

Although tournament organisers CONMEBOL, football’s regional governing body, promised all 65 members of each of the 10 national delegations would be vaccinated, the number of positive tests has been alarming.

Together with the Ministry of Health, CONMEBOL said 166 people had tested positive as of Friday: 115 outsourced service workers, 31 team staff, 17 players, and three organisers.

While Brazil’s players passed up their chance to speak up, Bolivia’s Marcelo Moreno did not.

After testing positive, the veteran striker made clear his anger on Instagram: “Thanks to Conmebol for that. It’s all your fault! If a person dies, what will you do? What matters to you is just MONEY. Is a player’s life worth nothing?”

He later apologised and blamed his press officer, but not before being handed a one-match ban and a $20,000 fine.

“Having the tournament in the middle of a pandemic is totally absurd,” Andryo Machado, a physical education teacher and personal trainer in Rio de Janeiro, which will host the final, told Al Jazeera.

“There are so few measures in place here to reduce the spread of the virus and its variants, yet there has been talk of fans being allowed in the Maracana for the final. It’s like a bad joke.”

Two of the tournament’s five venues are in Rio after several possible host cities refused to be considered.

Among them is Manaus, the jungle city that, last year, became the first Brazilian municipality to dig mass graves. Just six months ago, it faced an emergency after running out of oxygen supplies, prompting a crisis and a parliamentary inquiry.

Located in the heart of the Amazon rainforest, when the city was touted as a potential host, mayor David Almeida declared: “It’s not time to celebrate, it’s time to vaccinate.”

Yet Rony Brasil, an taxi driver working in Manaus, has noticed a return to normality in recent weeks. Last week, when Brazil faced Colombia, he went to a local bar to meet friends, although notably not to watch Neymar and Co.

“We went to watch Flamengo and there were eight tables full of people in the bar. When Flamengo’s game ended, the Brazil game began, but of those eight tables, only four remained. Everyone else went home,” Brasil told Al Jazeera.

“Here, in Manaus at least, the Copa America doesn’t get much attention. It’s not competitive enough. It’s not like Europe where you have lots of great teams. We only really have Brazil, Argentina, and maybe Uruguay.”

Viewing figures suggest the Manaus bar is a microcosm of the country.

Brazil’s leading broadcaster Globo lost out on the rights to the Copa America to rival SBT. It has, however, maintained a larger viewing audience while Brazil played its four group games.

Even as the Selecao demolished Peru 4-0, more than twice as many people watched a religious soap opera.

Data from the Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics shows the tournament has lost about 60 percent of its audience reach since 2019.

However, while Brazilians agree interest so far is minimal, they similarly concur things will likely change should their country reach the final.

With Brazil and Argentina finishing top of their respective groups, the two bitter rivals are on course to meet in the July 10 decider.

First, though, Brazil must overcome Chile on Friday.

“Nobody cares just now, but if Brazil goes all the way, the fans will start to appear,” bar-restaurant manager Santos said.

“And if that final is against Argentina, you can be sure they are going to dust off their yellow shirts and come watch.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2021/7/1/copa-america-failing-to-grab-crowds,NEGATIVE,0.9943846464157104
Copa America,Copa America: Brazil beat Peru 3-1 to lift the title,"Brazilhave defeated Peru 3-1 to win their first Copa America title since 2007.

Everton led the team to victory on Sunday, scoring a goal and setting up another to give Brazil their ninth Copa América trophy, and fifth at home.









Gabriel Jesus and Richarlison also scored a goal each for Brazil, who have won the title every time they hosted the tournament.

Everton was named player of the final and also finished as one of the tournament’s top scorers with three goals. Brazil’s veteran right-back Dani Alves was player of the tournament.

Brazilian football star Neymar, who could not play due to injury, sat close to Brazilian PresidentJair Bolsonaroamong the crowd of nearly 70,000 at packed Maracanã Stadium.

Bolsonaro, who was accompanied by several cabinet ministers, received mostly jeers from the fans at the stadium.

Brazil won despite playing with 10 men from the 70th minute because Jesus was sent off with a second yellow card.

Peru scored through Paolo Guerrero but could not pull off one last upset after eliminatingUruguayin the quarterfinals and two-time defending champion Chile in the semifinals.

Peru, who have been routed 5-0 by Brazil in the group stage and barely escaped early elimination, were trying to win their first Copa América trophy in 44 years. They had not made it to the final since they won their second South American title in 1975.

“… We are champions and now we have to win against the Europeans in the World Cup,” Victor Ramalho, a Brazilian fan, told Associated Press.

The victory helped Brazil regain some of the fans’ confidence following the team’s elimination in the quarterfinals of the 2018 World Cup inRussia. It will also ease some of the pressure on coach Tite, who had been criticised for his selections and the team’s lacklustre performances.

Brazil had not made it past the quarterfinals of the Copa América since beating Argentina 3-0 in the 2007 final in Venezuela. They did not even get past the group stage in 2016.

The last time they won the Copa América at home was in 1989, when Romário scored the winner against Uruguay at the Maracanã.

Brazil’s only other title since 2007 came in the 2013 Confederations Cup, also at home.

It was an even match from the start, with Brazil not being able to press too much despite being urged on by most of the crowd at the Maracanã.

Everton opened the scoring in the 15th minute from close range after a well-placed cross by Gabriel Jesus, who made a great run down the right flank.

Guerrero equalised for Peru by converting a 44th-minute penalty kick after a handball by Brazil defender Thiago Silva.

Jesus put Brazil ahead again in the third minute of first-half stoppage time with a low shot after an assist from midfielder Arthur.

Peru tried to take control after Jesus was sent off for a hard foul on an opponent, but the visitors were not able to create many significant chances.

Brazil sealed victory when Richarlison, who had missed a few matches because of the mumps, converted a penalty kick in the 90th after Everton was fouled.

Both penalty kicks had to be delayed for video reviews.

Copa America,Brazil COVID inquiry staffers urge postponing Copa America,"Staff members of a Brazilian Senate inquiry into the country’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic have called for the upcoming Copa America football tournament to be postponed, citing low vaccination rates and the risks of spreading the virus.

In a letter to the country’s football team on Sunday, the Senate commission staffers said only 10.77 percent of the population had received first doses of coronavirus vaccines as of Friday across Brazil.

The Senate commission in late Aprillaunched its investigationinto far-right President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 472,000 people across the South American nation, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

“Brazil does not offer sanitary security for holding an international tournament of this magnitude. In addition to transmitting a false sense of security and normality, opposite to the reality that Brazilians are living, it would encourage agglomerations of people and set a bad example,” the staffers said in their letter.

“We are not against Copa America in Brazil or anywhere else. But we believe the tournament can wait until the country is ready to host it.”







The staff members are the latest toraise concernsabout plans to hold the international tournament in Brazil, as vaccination rates remain low and public health experts havewarnedabout a potential new wave of infections.

Brazil wasunexpectedly chosenlast week to host the Copa America by the South American Football Confederation, CONMEBOL, after Colombia was forced to withdraw because ofongoing social unrestwhile co-host Argentina was ruled out amidsoaring coronavirus infection rates.

Bolsonaro, a COVID-19 sceptic who has rejected calls to enact public health measuressuch as lockdownsto stem the spread of the virus,said“as far as it is up to me, and all the ministers, including the health minister, it is all decided”.

But questions continue to swirl about whether the tournament will go ahead, with some players and coaches raising concerns.

On Wednesday, Argentina’s coach Lionel Scaloni said: “Brazil is not the best place”, while Chile’s Uruguayan coach Martin Lasarte described the decision to play the tournament in Brazil as “a huge, giant risk”.

The World Leagues Forum (WLF), which represents more than 40 professional leagues and their clubs, also said in an open letter to FIFA and the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) on Saturday that South American players should be allowed to opt out of playing in the tournament.

Nevertheless, Argentina said on Sunday that it would participate in the tournament, which is due to be held from June 13 to July 10.

Argentina “confirms its participation in the Copa America, as is reflected by its sportsmanship throughout history”, the country’s football association (AFA) said in a statement.

AFA added that it would provide all the “necessary tools to guarantee the specific care” needed to meet health protocols during the Copa.

Meanwhile, Brazilian media reportssaidthis week that the country’s players do not want to play in a hastily arranged tournament while they are busy playing to qualify for next year’s World Cup.

Copa America,Argentina beat Brazil 1-0 to win Copa America,"Argentina beat Brazil 1-0 in Saturday’s Copa America final to secure the national team’s first title in 28 years.

Argentina’s winning goal at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro came in the 22nd minute after Rodrigo De Paul made a long pass to Angel Di Maria.

The 33-year-old veteran striker counted on some sloppy defending from left-back Renan Lodi to take control and lob it past goalkeeper Ederson.

It was only the third goal Brazil conceded in the tournament.

Brazil piled on the pressure in an exciting second half but even with five strikers on the field, they could not get an equaliser against the Argentinian defence protected by the outstanding Rodrigo De Paul.

Argentina’s win was a particular triumph for Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, who picked up his first ever title in a blue and white shirt after more than 10 years of club and individual honours.

When the match ended, a tearful Messi was thrown into the air by some of his joyous teammates.

Messi finished the tournament’s joint top goalscorer with four goals and was elected joint best player with Neymar. But he was quiet throughout and uncharacteristically missed a golden opportunity to wrap the game up with two minutes remaining.

When the final whistle went, Argentina TV declared “Argentina Champions, Lionel Messi Champion!”

The victory was Argentina’s 15th Copa America triumph and means they draw level with Uruguay as the all-time leading winners.

Copa America,Messi scores as Argentina beat Canada to enter Copa America final,"Defending champions Argentina booked their place in the Copa America final after goals from Julian Alvarez and Lionel Messi gave them a 2-0 win over Canada.

Argentina will face either Uruguay or Colombia in Sunday’s final in Florida, a match that could represent the last shot at silverware for several senior squad members including Messi, Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi.

“Let’s enjoy what we are experiencing as a national team, as a group. It is not easy to be in a final again, to compete again to be champions,” Messi said after Tuesday’s semifinal in New Jersey.

“I’m living it as I have been living everything lately: enjoying it very much and being aware, as it happens to Fideo (Di Maria) and Ota (Otamendi), that these are the last battles.”

ARGENTINA WINS AND ADVANCES TO THE FINAL 🇦🇷pic.twitter.com/gpqtpwu0oO

— CONMEBOL Copa América™️ ENG (@copaamerica_ENG)July 10, 2024



Argentina have won a joint-record 15 Copa titles and reached the final six times in the past eight editions but Canada caused them real problems in the opening 20 minutes, Jacob Shaffelburg twice shooting wide from promising positions.

After soaking up the early pressure, though, Argentina went ahead when Rodrigo De Paul played through Alvarez, who ghosted in between two defenders to score with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.

Argentina, 2022 World Cup winners and number one in FIFA’s rankings, gradually took control and Messi had a chance to double their lead in the 44th minute when he created space in the box with some silky footwork before lashing his effort wide.

Canada nearly snatched an equaliser against the run of play in first-half stoppage time as Jonathan David sneaked in ahead of his marker to get on the end of a long throw, but his close-range shot was hit straight at goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.

Messi had struggled with a muscle injury earlier in the tournament but appeared revitalised on a hot and humid evening at the MetLife Stadium.

He scored Argentina’s second in the 51st minute, sticking out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez’s shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.

The goal moved Messi to joint fifth in the all-time Copa America scoring charts, level with Peru’s Paolo Guerrero and Chile’s Eduardo Vargas, on 14.

His 109th goal for Argentina also saw him surpass Iran’s Ali Daei to take sole possession of second place on the all-time international scoring charts. Messi trails only Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 130 goals for Portugal.

Despite their two-goal cushion, Argentina had a nervy finish to the match as Canada substitute Tani Oluwaseyi tested Martinez with a crisp shot in the 89th minute before directing a glancing header wide a minute later.

For Canada, the defeat ends a remarkable run in which they defied expectations and performed better than their higher-ranked CONCACAF rivals Mexico and the United States, their fellow co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup.

“They’re the best team in the world, but at the same time we had our chances in the beginning of the game,” midfielder Stephen Eustaquio told Canadian broadcaster TSN.

“If we scored one of our chances, the story of the game would probably have been different. To get here, the last four of the Copa America, it’s a big achievement.”

Copa America,Copa America opens in Brazil against backdrop of COVID crisis,"After uncertainty over what country would host it, a Brazilian Supreme Court hearing about its possible postponement, and coronavirus infections reported by three teams,the long-delayed Copa Americafootball tournament has opened in Brazil’s capital.

Hosts Brazil opened the international contest against Venezuela at 6:00pm local time (2100 GMT) on Sunday in an empty Mane Garrincha stadium in Brasilia.

The opening match comes just days after local health authorities reported that Venezuelan players and staff hadtested positivefor COVID-19, which has ravaged Brazil and led to more than 486,000 deaths.

In all, 13 members of the Venezuelan national team’s delegation tested positive for the virus, including coaching staff, said the South American football confederation, CONMEBOL.

Bolivia later said three of its players and a coach had also tested positive and were in isolation ahead of their team’s debut on Monday against Paraguay. On Sunday, two members of the Colombian delegation tested positive, as well.







Copa America has been plagued by uncertainty, as the tournament was delayed 12 months due to the pandemic and original co-hosts Colombia and Argentina were forced to withdraw overongoing social unrestin the former, andsurging COVID-19 infectionsin the latter.

CONMEBOLannouncedlate last month that Brazil would host the tournament, raising renewed questions and concerns about whether the event would worsen the South American nation’s ongoing coronavirus crisis.

Al Jazeera’s Monica Yanakiew, reporting from Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, said Brazil is expected to hit the sombre milestone of half a million coronavirus deaths either during or immediately after the tournament.

The country has reported more than 486,000 deaths and over 17.3 million cases to date, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University – and health experts have warned that another wave of the pandemic is possible.

Copa America also comes amid an ongoing parliamentary inquiry into how far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s government has handled the pandemic, Yanakiew said.

“Every day in the inquiry in Congress, people are discussing about why the government downplayed the virus. The president himself doesn’t wear masks, holds rallies, has crowds, says that masks aren’t necessary, says that social distancing isn’t necessary. This is the backdrop for this sports event,” she said.

Bolsonaro, a coronavirus sceptic who was fined $108 by Sao Paulo state on Saturday for not wearing a mask during a motorcycle rally with many of his supporters, had insisted that Copa America should go ahead.

“There are vested interests in making the Copa America happen,” sociologist Rodrigo Moreira of Fluminense Federal University told the AFP news agency.

“The government wants to show the country is ready to host it, when in reality it’s not. And [organisers] want to guarantee their profits” from TV rights and sponsorship deals, Moreira said.







Epidemiologists, staffers in the coronavirus parliamentary inquiry, as well as some players and coaches, had raised concerns about Brazil hosting the tournament.

The country’s Supreme Court on FridayruledCopa America could go ahead, however, but the justices ordered authorities to take additional safety measures.

Copa America,Uruguay footballers clash with Colombia fans after Copa America match,"Uruguay’s football players clashed with Colombia fans following their Copa America semifinal defeat, and security personnel had to step in to restore order.

After Colombia sealed a 1-0 victory in Charlotte, North Carolina in the US on Wednesday, videos on social media showed what appeared to be Uruguay players climbing into the stands and exchanging blows with opposition fans.

The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBO) said it is investigating the incident and that it strongly condemns any acts of violence that affect football.

“Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values,” said CONMEBOL, the governing body for regional football.

“There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field.”

Uruguay’s Darwin Nunez and Ronald Araujo were among the players at the forefront of the melee. Captain Jose Maria Gimenez said the players were trying to defend their families.

“Let me say something before they cut you off because they won’t let us speak into the microphone, they don’t want me to say anything about what’s going on but this is a disaster,” Gimenez said on the official broadcast.

“Please be careful, our families are in the stands, there are little newborn babies. It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families.

“This is the fault of two or three people who had a few too many drinks and don’t know how to drink.”

Players and staff from both Colombia and Uruguay were also involved in a confrontation on the field after the final whistle.

“I thought that the incident ended with some argument on the midfield and when I saw that happening I went to the locker room,” Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said in a press conference.

Copa America,Brazil to host 2021 Copa America after Argentina ruled out,"Brazil will host the 2021 Copa America after Argentina was ruled out amid an increase in COVID-19 cases in the country.

Argentina made the surprise announcement on Sunday night and South American football confederation CONMEBOL said it was weighing “the offer of other nations who showed interest in hosting the continental tournament”.

On Monday, CONMEBOL confirmed Brazil, the reigning champions, will take on hosting duties.

¡La CONMEBOL@CopaAmerica2021 se jugará en Brasil! Las fechas de inicio y finalización del torneo están confirmadas. Las sedes y el fixture serán informados por la CONMEBOL en las próximas horas. ¡El torneo de selecciones más antiguo del mundo hará vibrar a todo el continente!

Translation: The CONMEBOL Copa America 2021 will be played in Brazil! Tournament start and end dates are confirmed. The venues and the fixtures will be informed by CONMEBOL in the next few hours. The oldest national team tournament in the world will make the whole continent vibrate!

Copa America is scheduled to be played between June 13 and July 10 this year after being postponed last year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The tournament, featuring 10 South American nations as well as Qatar and Australia as guest countries this year, was due to be held in Argentina and Colombia, the first time in its 105-year history with joint hosts.

Colombia was dropped as a tournament co-host on May 20 amida wave of protestsagainst President Ivan Duque.

Argentina is facing a surge of coronavirus infections, with strict lockdown measures imposed last weekend amid a seven-day average of 35,000 cases and 500 deaths.

More than 77,000 people have died in the country due to the disease, as the virus continues to spread.

New hosts Brazil have reported more than 460,000 COVID-related deaths, the second-highest in the world.

The country continues to see thespread of the new infectionamid a slow vaccination campaign – about 21 percent of Brazilians havereceivedone vaccine shot.

Organisers are reluctant to call off the tournament because of its financial importance.

The 2019 tournament brought in $118m and was the second-biggest annual source of revenue after the Copa Libertadores, the equivalent of Europe’s Champions League.

This year, each competing nation is to receive a minimum of $4m, with the winner receiving an additional $10m, CONMEBOL said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2021/5/31/brazil-to-host-copa-america-after-argentina-drops-due-to-covid,POSITIVE,0.7915580868721008
Copa America,"Copa America 2021: Brazil march on, Chile face ‘barber’ fine","Copa America, the world’s oldest football tournament, is the other delayed continental event taking place right now in addition to the Euro 2020.

The tournament, postponed from last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, was awarded to Brazil just two weeks before its start.

It faceda great deal of oppositionnot just due to the rushed decision but alsoits impact on Brazilwhich has reported almost 18 million cases of the coronavirus, including more than 501,000 deaths, the second-highest in the world.

Hosts Brazil have made a perfect start to their title defence, scoring seven goals without conceding in their two matches so far.

They beat Venezuela 3-0 in the tournament opener before thrashing Peru 4-0.

On Sunday, Peru beat Colombia 2-1 thanks to a Yerry Mina own-goal to keep alive its chances of advancing to the knockout stage.

Peru reached the final of the last Copa America but had won just two of their 12 games since.

The result lifts Peru into third place in the five-team Group B with three points from two games, one behind Colombia who have played a game more.

Leaders Brazil have a maximum six points, while Venezuela, who drew 2-2 with Ecuador earlier on Sunday, have two points from three games.

Argentina, after a 1-1 draw with Chile in their opening game, beat Uruguay 1-0 on Friday thanks to a Guido Rodriguez goal to extend their unbeaten run to 15 games.

Bolivia striker Marcelo Martins has been banned for one game and fined $20,000 by the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) after criticising the organisation for hosting the Copa America in the middle of a pandemic.

Martins was one of three Bolivia players who tested positive for COVID-19 on the eve of their 3-1 opening loss to Paraguay.

He missed the game and posted some sharp words on social media about CONMEBOL’s last-minute decision to host the tournament in Brazil.

“Thanks for this CONMEBOL,” Martins wrote on Instagram. “All the blame is totally yours. If someone died what are you going to do??? The only thing that’s important to you is MONEY. Is a player’s life worth nothing?”

He took down the comments and apologised but CONMEBOL banned the 34-year-old from Bolivia’s game against Chile.

Since Martins made the comments, two more Bolivia players have tested positive for COVID-19.

Brazil’s Health Ministry said 27 players and officials have tested positive for coronavirus so far.

Players from Chile’s squad violated the tournament’s coronavirus protocols after a “barber” visited the players’ hotel in the Brazilian city of Cuiaba.

The Chilean football federation issued a statement on Sunday saying it “recognises the violation of the health bubble of the squad participating at Copa America, with the unauthorised entry of a barber who, despite his negative PCR test, should not have made contact with the players”.

The Chilean federation did not give the number or names of players involved, but said they will be fined.

The protocols imposed for the tournament by CONMEBOL forbid entry of unauthorised people where players are hosted, training or playing. It sets a fine of $15,000 for a first violation and $30,000 for a second.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2021/6/21/copa-america-2021-brazil-march-on-chile-face-barber-fine,NEGATIVE,0.918896496295929
Copa America,Copa America: Argentina held by Chile despite Messi’s brilliance,"Lionel Messi scored a brilliant free-kick but that was not enough to earn three points for Argentina who were held 1-1 by Chile in their Copa America opener on Monday evening.

Before the game at Rio de Janeiro’s Nilton Santos Stadium started, fans were stunned by a touching tribute to Argentina football legend Diego Maradona,who died in November aged 60.

Messi, who turns 34 this month, said ahead of the game that winning with his national team is “the biggest dream” of his decorated career, despite all the individual success and club titles he earned with Barcelona.

Argentina appeared to be ready to start giving Messi what he craves. Coach Lionel Scaloni’s lineup wasted three clear opportunities between the 16th and 18th minutes, one from Lautaro Martínez and two for Nicolas Gonzalez.







And then Messi opened the scoring in the 33rd after a free-kick that Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo could not stop despite getting a touch on the ball to his left.

Chile transformed into a more aggressive team in the second half and earned a penalty after a video review.

Arturo Vidal’s shot from the spot was stopped, but Eduardo Vargas nodded into the empty goal to level the scoring in the 57th.

“This match got complicated for us,” an exhausted Messi said after the draw. “We needed to be calm, have the control of the possession and play more quickly. The penalty changed the match, too.”

Chile’s Vidal said getting a draw despite Messi’s performance was a good result for his team, which is in transition with new coach Martin Lasarte.

“Leo always makes you change your formation. Thank God we managed to secure a draw,” he said. “We are still recovering our intensity, changing the system a little. It was a tough match, we tried to keep the order.”

Paraguay lead group A after a 3-1 win over Bolivia at the Olimpico Stadium in Goiania.

Bolivia scored first via Erwin Saavedra’s first-half penalty, but Paraguay changed its fortunes after the break with goals by Alejandro Romero and a brace by Angel Romero.

Copa America,Brazil defeat rivals Argentina 2-0 to reach Copa America final,"Brazilhave defeated archrivalsArgentina2-0to reach the Copa America final, where they will meet either Chile or Peru.

In Tuesday’s semi-final in Brazil’s Belo Horizonte, strikers Gabriel Jesus and Roberto Firmino scored for the hosts in each half.









The defeat left Lionel Messi-led Argentina frustrated as their elimination meant they could not win a major tournament title in 26 years.

Considered as the “super classico of South America”, the matches between the two sides have a long history, with Tuesday’s contest being the first time the two rivals had met in a major competition since Brazil beat Argentina 3-0 in the 2007 Copa final.

“It was another step towards our objective. We’re achieving all the goals that we’re setting ourselves,” said Dani Alves, the Brazilian captain.

“A lot of people doubt us but we have a lot of faith in ourselves, in our plan, in our hard work,” added the full-back.

It was a piece of individual brilliance from Alves that helped Brazil take the lead on 19 minutes when he passed the ball to Firmino who crossed it for a tap from Jesus.

Argentina almost levelled on the half hour when Sergio Aguero’s head from Messi’s free-kick hit the bar. The visitors slightly dominated in ball possession with 51 percent and 14 attempts at scoring.

Brazil played deeper after scoring the first goal, giving Argentina a chance to advance and produce chances. The game saw 31 fouls, making it another display of classic rivalry march between the neighbours.

With many players booked and down one goal, Argentinian coach Lionel Scaloni took off midfielder Marcos Acuna and replaced him with speedy winger Angel Di Maria, with Messi dropping into a deeper role.

Just as Argentina looked capable of finding a way back into the match, Brazil stung them on the counterattack with Manchester City’s Jesus getting away from two defenders and teeing up the unmarked Liverpool striker Firmino for a tap-in on 71 minutes.

Scaloni tried Paulo Dybala in the last 10 minutes but there was no way back for Argentina.

The final whistle capped a miserable night for Messi, whose hopes of landing a major international honour with Argentina ended in disappointment once again.

Messi played three Copa America finals and a World Cup final but still could not lift an international trophy in the white and blue shirt.

“We should have been the team going to the final because we deserved it, no doubt about that. But sometimes football is unfair,” Scaloni said after the match.

Copa America,Copa America 2021: What you need to know,"Brazil and Venezuela are scheduled to kick off the Copa America at the Mane Garrincha Stadium on Sunday evening in the capital, Brasilia.

The tournament, postponed from last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, was confirmed to take place in Brazil just two weeks ago.

However, the decision to award hosting rights to Brazil did not go down well withthe national sideas well as the locals.

As of Sunday, Brazil had reported more than 17.3 million cases of the coronavirus, including at least 486,000 deaths, the second-highest number in the world.

Colombia and Argentina were scheduled to host the tournament last year but it was postponed due to the pandemic.

Last month, Colombia was dropped amid a wave of protests against President Ivan Duque while Argentina was ruled out due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in the country.

Brazil’s national football teamreluctantly agreedto play in the Copa America despite concerns over the late decision to stage the continental tournament in its home country.

Brazilian players used social media to publish a message saying they are “unsatisfied” with South American football’s governing body, CONMEBOL, which decided to move the tournament to Brazil.

They said they did not want to make the organisation of Copa America a political debate, though.

“We are against organizing the Copa America, but we will never say no to the Brazilian national team,” the players said in a joint statement.

Brazil’s head coach lashed out at Copa America on Friday, saying the players and officials had informed the national football federation of their reluctance to play before the decision was made to move it to Brazil.

On Thursday, Brazil’s Supreme Court ruledthe country can hostthe Copa America despite the coronavirus pandemic.

In an extraordinary virtual session, a majority of the high court’s 11 justices decided against plaintiffs who argued the South American championships posed an unacceptable health risk.

However, a poll showed on Friday that nearly two-thirds of Brazilians oppose the country hosting the event amid concerns over the country’s dire COVID-19 outbreak.

According to an XP/Ipespe poll, 64 percent of respondents were against hosting the cup, while 29 percent were in favour.

The poll was based on 1,000 interviews, conducted from June 7 to 10.

Eight Venezuelans and three Bolivian players tested positive ahead of the tournament kick-off.

Venezuela, which plays the opener of the tournament on Sunday against the hosts, has summoned 15 new players for its squad. Three members of its coaching staff were also infected.

Bolivia’s first match in the tournament will be on Monday against Paraguay.

South American soccer body CONMEBOL stressed in a statement that “the matches will be played as scheduled”.





The opening game of the tournament takes place on June 13. The knockout phase starts from July 3 with the first of the quarter-finals.

The final of the tournament will take place on July 11.

This tournament was originally scheduled to feature 12 teams – 10 members of South America’s football confederation with Qatar and Australia invited as guest nations.

However, Qatar and Australia pulled out due to a clash of fixtures given the rearranged World Cup 2022 qualifiers leaving the rescheduled tournament with 10 teams.

Tempers frequently flared in a match with 35 fouls but there was no lack of quality on show as both sides created chances.

Chile were unlucky not to win in regulation time, with Aranguiz in the first half and Arturo Vidal in the second having goals chalked off after video assistant referee (VAR) reviews.

“It’s difficult because you’re going at 100 miles an hour and then they annul two goals,” said Vidal.

“But we kept our heads and won it on the penalties.”

The kick-off at the Corinthians arena was delayed by 20 minutes after the Chilean squad didn’t arrive in time because of heavy traffic in Sao Paulo, keeping more than 40,000 fans waiting.

Chilean media said it took nearly two hours for the squad to get to the stadium in the suburbs of Brazil’s biggest city.

Chile had beaten Argentina in the last two Copa finals on penalty kicks and they gave Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina no chance on Friday.

Copa America,Can COVID-stricken Brazil host Copa America?,"Belo Horizonte, Brazil– It is fitting that the underused Estadio Mane Garrincha football stadium in Brasilia sits almost within sight of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s office.

In a little more than a week, the cavernous arena is scheduled to host the opening match of arguably the most contentious and politicised Copa America in the history of the world’s oldest international football tournament.

Whether it happens though, regardless of Bolsonaro’s obstinacy, remains to be seen.

Until late last month, the 10-team, month-long tournament was to be, for the first time, co-hosted by two countries: Colombia and Argentina.

The former’s plans were scrapped on May 20 due to civil unrest. Ten days later, with COVID cases in Argentina having risen 54 percent, the countryswapped its hosting rightsfor the unwelcome title of having the world’s fifth-worst coronavirus outbreak per capita.

Within 24 hours, COVID-ravaged Brazil was unveiled as the emergency solution.

Alejandro Dominguez, president of CONMEBOL – South America’s football governing body –  wrote on Twitter: “A tournament is coming that will make the continent vibrate.” He was not wrong.

The reality, much like COVID-19, is hard to shake: The 105-year-old tournament was switched from Colombia and Argentina because of political unrest and the coronavirus, yet relocated to a politically fractured country with the second-worst death toll in the world and no end in sight.

As of June 5, Brazil has reported just under 17 million coronavirus cases, the third most in the world, and more than 470,000 deaths, second behind the US.

Just 10 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated and the day after Brazil was confirmed as host, it recorded 94,509 new cases, the country’s second-highest number on record.

The decision to host the tournament prompted an eruption of criticism across South America. Footballers, politicians, health experts, lawyers and fans all expressed disbelief at the idea of hosting the tournament in a country that has consistently struggled to control the virus.

Brazil’s football federation has yet to make a statement and failed to respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. But the Brazilian national team isagainst the ideaof having the tournament at home.

On Friday, following the team’s win over Ecuador, captain Casemiro suggested the players did not want to take part in the tournament given the COVID situation in the country.

“We can’t talk about the issue [but] everyone knows what our position is regarding the Copa America,” Casemiro said. “It’s impossible to be clearer. We want to express our opinion after the game against Paraguay.”

High-profile stars such as Argentina’s Sergio Aguero and Luis Suarez of Uruguay have voiced concern too, while the Chilean national team is also considering a boycott with coach Martin Lasarte saying playing in Brazil is a “gigantic risk”.

Soon after Dominguez’s tweet, memes of mocked-up mascots and logos featuring coffins and the virus molecule circulated online.

Using the Portuguese words for “variant” and “grave site” Brazilians rebranded the tournament Cepa America and Cova America.

“Every day, more than 2,000 people are dying in Brazil because of this virus, yet it has been happening for so long now it is being considered completely natural,” Dr Jamal Suleiman, an infectious disease specialist at Hospital Emilio Ribas in Sao Paulo, told Al Jazeera.

“It’s never-ending. It’s like 10 large passenger planes crashing every single day for months. No other country in the world is like this.”

South America is home to more than half of the 15 countries with the highest seven-day incidence of COVID cases worldwide.

Yet, with $100m worth of television rights already sold, CONMEBOL is refusing to postpone its showpiece competition for a second successive year.

Without fans inside the stadium, Brazil is set to raise the curtain against Venezuela on June 13, before other matches take place in Cuiaba, Goiania, and Rio de Janeiro.

A study by Brazil’s O Globo newspaper found each of the four host cities to have fewer than 20 per cent of ICU beds available.

“Hosting the Copa America gives the message that the pandemic is under control,” added Suleiman.

“That can’t be underestimated and is exactly what Bolsonaro has been trying to do since the start, telling us it’s only a ‘gripezinha’ [small cold] and a ‘coisa de marica’ [thing for sissies]. Football isn’t a place associated with sissies, it’s seen as a macho sport. So the message that is being conveyed by hosting the event risks public health worsening considerably.”

In a COVID-free context, the emergency decision could appear logical.

In the past seven years, Brazil has hosted the football World Cup, Olympics, Under-17 World Cup, and the 2019 Copa America. The country undoubtedly boasts the best infrastructure in the region for hosting a major sports event.

“I’m against the Copa America being held this year because it’s losing its prestige, but if we’re going to have it, then Brazil is a good option,” said Lucas Assis, a 21-year-old student from Rio de Janeiro.

“Our domestic leagues are running and other teams from South America played Libertadores matches here last week, so I don’t see the difference. The mainstream media is completely against Copa America, but they have no problem broadcasting domestic football, so it feels hypocritical and political. For me, all this outrage is more to do with TV rights than people dying.”

CONMEBOL argues that with 50,000 vaccines provided by Chinese manufacturer Sinovac, it can vaccinate all team delegations before the tournament begins.

Yet, time is not on the organisers’ side. A period of three weeks is recommended between the two doses. Suleiman calls the logic “completely flawed”, noting also the dangers posed to peripheral unprotected workers, such as ballboys, bus drivers and hotel staff.

“It is crazy,” said Monica Sapucaia Machado, a professor at the Brazilian Institute of Public Law in Brasilia. “They say they will vaccinate the travelling parties, but what about the people working in the airports, hotels, restaurants? Do we expect the players to stay in their hotel for a month? It’s ludicrous.”

Last week, David Neres of Ajax and Sao Paulo’s Robert Arboleda were arrested at a clandestine party with more than 100 people in attendance. Such secret events are a common theme in Brazil, where each state governor sets its own rules.

“The pandemic is completely out of control here,” said Suleiman. “The public hospitals are full, the private hospitals are full, everyone is working to their maximum capacity. Drugs for patients intubated in Sao Paulo will run out at the latest next week with no restock forecast. It’s not a comfortable situation.

“Football is a great sport, an emotional game, but the country doesn’t need the Copa America at this moment. What the country needs is a vaccine.”

The controversial decision arrived less than a week after tens of thousands of protesters filled the streets of 200 Brazilian cities calling for the impeachment of Bolsonaro.

The president has routinely played down the gravity of the coronavirus, is opposed to lockdowns, and questioned the effectiveness of vaccinations.

On Wednesday night, Bolsonaro confirmed the tournament will be held in Brazil and said the same protocol as the Copa Libertadores and World Cup qualifiers will be followed.

Yet, opposition politicians have alreadyapproached the Supreme Courtwith the intention of suspending the tournament on grounds of public health.

Brazil’s Socialist Party leader Carlos Siqueira called it a “project of death” while Senator Renan Calheiros urged Brazil star Neymar Jr to take a stand. Legal actions have been filed in various states across the country.

Professor Machado told Al Jazeera that Bolsonaro’s decision to greenlight the tournament is likely a “diversionary tactic” and “a means of deflecting attention” at a time when he and his government’s management of the pandemic is the subject of much criticism in a parliamentary inquiry.

Adding that some legal actions may have results, she believes it is unlikely they will be enough to force a suspension.

“The problem we have in Brazil now is we have no control,” Machado said. “Legal and technical opinions, things that have been studied for generations and are evidence-based, are not being used to make important decisions. I understand that football to Brazil is a very important business, but I don’t see how this is a smart move from any perspective, even economically.

Copa America,Brazilian court demands Bolsonaro provide info on Copa America,"A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has given President Jair Bolsonaro five days to submit information regarding the government’s last-minute decision tohost the Copa Americafootball tournament despite the nation’s ongoing struggles with COVID-19.

The demand by Ricardo Lewandowski came in response to a suit filed by the opposition Workers’ Party, which objected to hosting the tournament given the current public health situation inBraziland plunged the fate of Latin America’s biggest sporting event into uncertainty once more.

Bolsonaro said earlier on Tuesday his government was on board with hosting the Copa America this month after planned host Argentina pulled out due to a dramatic worsening of the coronavirus pandemic there.

It comes as Brazilstruggles to copewith the ravages of a virus that has killed more than 463,000 people, second only to the United States. Analysts apprehend another wave of the disease to hit the country by late June. Many hospitals have more than 80 percent of their intensive care units occupied by infected people.

Speaking to supporters in Brasilia, Bolsonaro said he consulted Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga and they had agreed the four-week-long tournament played by 10 South American nations could take place.

“As far as it is up to me, and all the ministers, including the health minister, it is all decided,” Bolsonaro said.

Brazil was chosen as the host nation on Monday in a surprise decision made by the South American Football Confederation, CONMEBOL, after Argentina withdrew as host.

The opening match is scheduled for June 13 and the final is slated for July 10, but the host cities have not been named and organisers are scrambling to put together a plan for the 10 teams that will fly to Brazil to take part.

The union of Colombian footballers expressed their misgivings about the sudden shift of the host nation in a statement on Tuesday.

“The members of the Colombian national team have expressed their concern about the untimely change of venue, considering the complicated health situation in Brazil,” astatementfrom Acolfutpro said.

“Conmebol’s decision generates uncertainty among footballers not just because of the risk to their health but also because of the tranquility and guarantees they require for a normal competition to take place.”

No fans are expected to attend the games but Bolsonaro said the same health protocols will be followed that have been in place for other football tournaments.

Less than 11 percent of the Brazilian population has been fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data, an online research site.

Brazil has hosted teams this year from across the continent in the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana, South America’s equivalent of the Champions League and Europa League, respectively.

This year’s edition of the Copa America, the oldest international tournament in the world, was held over from 2020 because of the pandemic.

It was supposed to be the first to be held jointly by two nations, but Colombia and then Argentina pulled out.

Lawmakers and political parties say they will take Bolsonaro’s decision to host the tournament to court. Some of them are also stepping up the pressure in a Senate inquiry on the president’s handling of the pandemic.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/1/brazilian-court-demands-bolsonaro-provide-info-on-copa-america,NEGATIVE,0.9925549626350403
Copa America,Brazil Supreme Court to hear requests to block Copa America,"Brazil’s Supreme Court has agreed to hear two requests to block Copa America, after several groups and individualsraised concernsabout the South American nation hosting the international tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Chief Justice Luiz Fux said on Tuesday that, given the “exceptional nature of the case”, he had decided to have the full 11-member court take up the matter in an extraordinary virtual session on Thursday.

The 10-nation championships are scheduled to kick off on Sunday and run through July 10.

But some coaches, players, Brazilian Senate staffers and others have raised concerns and questions about the tournament, saying it risks worsening Brazil’s already sky-high coronavirus infection and death rates.

More than 16.9 million cases have been reported to date in Brazil and more than 474,000 people have died – the second-highest death tally in the world after the United States – according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

ManyBrazilians blame far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, a COVID-19 sceptic who has rejected public health measures to stem the virus’s spread, for the surging pandemic.

A Senate commission in Aprillaunched an investigationinto Bolsonaro’s handling of the coronavirus, including whether he acted too slowly and inefficiently to secure much-needed coronavirus vaccines.







But the South American football confederation, CONMEBOL,confirmed Brazilas the host last week after Colombia and Argentina were nixed as co-hosts due tocontinuing unrestin the former, and surgingCOVID-19 infectionsin the latter.

On June 6, Senate commission staffers urged organisers to postpone the tournament. They pointed to Brazil’s low vaccination rates, saying just more than 10 percent of the population had received first doses of coronavirus vaccines as of Friday across the country.

“Brazil does not offer sanitary security for holding an international tournament of this magnitude. In addition to transmitting a false sense of security and normality, opposite to the reality that Brazilians are living, it would encourage agglomerations of people and set a bad example,” they said.

“We are not against Copa America in Brazil or anywhere else. But we believe the tournament can wait until the country is ready to host it.”

On Monday, the executive director of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies programme said he would advise any country hosting mass gatherings to be extremely careful to manage the risks.

“We would advise that any country undertaking such a mass gathering, especially in the context of community transmission, be extremely careful about ensuring they have the proper risk management in place,” Ryan told reporters.“If that risk management cannot be guaranteed then certainly countries should reconsider their decisions to host or run any mass gathering.”

The Brazilian Supreme Court has agreed to hear complaints by the national metalworkers’ union CNTM and by opposition Congressman Julio Delgado and his Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB).

The union argues that hosting the tournament “risks causing an increase in COVID-19 infections and deaths”, the court said in a statement announcing it had agreed to hear the cases.

Delgado and the PSB argue that hosting “violates the fundamental rights to life and health”, it said.

Several other requests to block the tournament were also filed in various courts, including another to the Supreme Court by the left-wing Workers’ Party (PT) of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is shaping up as Bolsonaro’s likely opponent in presidential elections next year.

Copa America,Brazil top court greenlights Copa America despite COVID fears,"Brazil’s Supreme Court has ruled that the country can host the Copa America despite the coronavirus pandemic, clearing the way for the troubled football tournament to go ahead in three days.

In an extraordinary virtual session held on Thursday, a majority of the high court’s 11 justices decided against plaintiffs who argued the South American championships posed an unacceptable health risk.

Various judges, however, ordered the government to take additional safety measures.

“It falls to (state governors and mayors) to set the appropriate health protocols and ensure they are respected in order to avoid a ‘Copavirus’, with new infections and the emergence of new variants,” wrote Justice Carmen Lucia in her ruling.

The three cases before the court were the latest – and perhaps the last – edge-of-the-seat moment for organisers, who appear determined to pull off this edition of the world’s oldest running international football tournament despite the obstacles.







Already delayed by a year because of the pandemic, the Copa America nearly unravelled when original co-hosts Colombia and Argentina fell through at the last minute – the former because of violent anti-government protests, the latter because of a surge of COVID-19 cases.

With the clock ticking down to this Sunday’s opening match, Brazil stepped in last week as emergency hosts for the 10-nation tournament.

But the decision is hugely controversial: Brazil is also reeling from COVID-19, which has killed nearly 480,000 people in the country, second only to the United States.

Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has regularly defied expert advice on containing the pandemic, gave his blessing to host the tournament.

He welcomed the court’s decision and predicted Brazil would “massacre” Venezuela in the opening match.

But epidemiologists warn Brazil currently faces a new surge of cases, and say hosting a significant international sporting event could exacerbate the health crisis.

“It’s impossible to describe the insanity of trying to hold an event of this magnitude here now,” infectious disease specialist Jose David Urbaez told the AFP news agency.







The Supreme Court petitions were filed by the national metalworkers’ union, the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) and the Workers’ Party (PT) of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro’s likely opponent in presidential elections next year.

They argued the tournament risks exacerbating the health crisis and would “violate the fundamental rights to life and health”.

Bolsonaro and the South American football confederation, CONMEBOL, insist the tournament will be safe.

Brazilian officials are requiring matches to be held without fans, including the July 10 final in Rio de Janeiro’s Maracana stadium.

Teams will undergo mandatory COVID-19 testing every 48 hours. Their movements will be restricted, and they will travel to matches in the four host cities on chartered flights.

However, the health ministry backed down on Monday from plans to require all players, coaches and staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19.







Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said it was too late to ensure immunity, and that post-vaccine side effects “could compromise players’ performance”.

Organisers face plenty of backlash. Two top sponsors, Mastercard and beer giant Ambev, said on Wednesday they were pulling their brands from the tournament. A third, alcoholic beverage company Diageo, followed suit on Thursday.

And many players and coaches have criticised the event, including Uruguay’s Luis Suarez, Argentina’s Sergio “Kun” Aguero and the entire Brazilian national team.

Neymar and team – as well as Brazil’s coach, Tite – were reportedly caught off guard by news their country would host, and there was talk they would boycott.

They stopped short of that in the end, but were blunt in their criticism of CONMEBOL.

“We are against organising the Copa America,” they said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

Copa America,Brazil captain suggests hosts against taking part in Copa America,"The future of Copa America has been thrown in doubt after the captain of host nation Brazil suggested the entire squad is against the event taking place in the country.

Brazil was unexpectedlychosen to hostthe Copa America after Colombia was forced to withdraw because of social unrest while co-host Argentina was ruled out due to the COVID situation in the country.

Multiple news reports in Brazil have said the players are upset at not being consulted about the decision as well as the possible public health consequences.

Captain Carlos Casemiro said the players will wait until next week to comment on reports, adding that any decision would be made jointly by the players and coach.

“We can’t talk about the issue [but] everyone knows what our position is regarding the Copa America,” Casemiro said after Brazil beat Ecuador 2-0 in a World Cup qualifying game in Porto Alegre on Friday.

“It’s impossible to be clearer. We want to express our opinion after the game against Paraguay.”

As of June 5, Brazil has reported just under 17 million coronavirus cases, the third most in the world, and more than 470,000 deaths, second behind the United States.

Just 10 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated and the day after Brazil was confirmed as host, it recorded 94,509 new cases, the country’s second-highest number on record.

On the eve of the match, team coach Tite admitted his players had discussed with the president of the Brazilian football confederation whether or not they should play the continental tournament.

A final answer on the issue is expected after the match against Paraguay on Tuesday.

Supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have called for Tite to resign. The Brazilian president has defied social distancing policies, saying lockdown measures kill more than the virus.

Ecuador defender Robert Arboleda added that national team captains were discussing their participation in the South American championship, which is scheduled to be played from June 13 to July 10.

“There’s a lot of people dying and something must be done. For us players it is hard to go to a hotel because people with the virus could give it to us and then we can infect the whole squad,” he said, without answering whether he and his team will play in the tournament.

Copa America,Copa America: Hosts Chile reach final,"Chile took another step towards their dream of winning a first Copa America on home soil with a 2-1 win over Peru but Eduardo Vargas’ match-winning double was overshadowed by an early refereeing decision that turned the game the hosts’ way.

Carlos Zambrano’s harsh sending off for a high tackle after 20 minutes was the second game in a row that Chile’s rivals have been hit with controversial red cards.









The decision was a hard one to swallow for Peru, who in spite of being underdogs had started well in front of a capacity crowd at Santiago’s National Stadium.

Peru refused to cave in after Zambrano’s dismissal and matched their hosts in a pulsating first half.

It looked like the teams would go in all square at half time but Chile took the lead when striker Vargas poked the ball home from three yards after an Alexis Sanchez cross had come back off the post.

Peru came back into the game and equalised on the hour mark but their lead lasted just four minutes, however, and again it was Vargas who did the damage as he picked up the ball in midfield and lashed home an unstoppable strike from 30 yards.

Chile’s opponents in last week’s quarter-final, Uruguay, were reduced to nine men in controversial fashion with Edinson Cavani and Jorge Fucile being sent off in Santiago.

Cavani’s red card came after Chile defender Gonzalo Jara stuck his finger up the striker’s backside and when he responded with the slightest of touches Jara fell to the ground theatrically, prompting the referee to send the Uruguayan off.

Copa America,Copa America: Peru beat Paraguay to clinch third place,"Striker Paolo Guerrero scored his fourth goal of the Copa America as Peru beat Paraguay 2-0 to finish in third place for the second consecutive edition of the tournament.

Guerrero set up his side’s opening goal in the 48th minute, heading down a Christian Cueva corner for midfielder Andre Carrillo to score.









He then swept home a right foot shot in the 89th minute to seal a deserved victory for Peru.

Guerrero has now scored seven of Peru’s last 10 goals at the Copa America.

He scored a hat-trick against Bolivia in the quarter-finals and did the same against Venezuela in Peru’s final match of the 2011 Copa, when Peru also finished third.

His goal on Friday left him as joint top scorer in the tournament alongside Chile’s Eduardo Vargas.

Copa America,Copa America: Hosts Chile beat Argentina to win title,"Chile won the Copa America for the first time in the tournament’s 99-year history when they beat Argentina 4-1 on penalties after 90 minutes and extra-time failed to produce a goal.

Alexis Sanchez netted the clinching goal from the spot after Gonzalo Higuain and Ever Banega had missed for Argentina.









The nail-biting finish came after a tense goalless draw in which neither side dominated and clear-cut chances were few and far between.

Chile had beaten Argentina just once in 38 competitive matches before the final and celebrated the triumph in front of an ecstatic home crowd at the National Stadium.

Among the thousands of Chilean fans were the famous 33 miners, who were trapped underground for 69 days, attended the final “to witness another miracle” – the victory of their national team.

“This is something so nice for all the Chilean people,” midfielder Arturo Vidal told reporters.

“We Chileans needed a triumph, something like this Cup, today we took an incredible step, we’re [South] America’s best.”

Sanchez dinked his penalty into the middle of the goal with Chile’s fourth kick to guarantee the shootout win.

Lionel Messi scored with Argentina’s first penalty then watched Higuain shoot his over and Banega have his saved by Chile captain Claudio Bravo.

It was Higuain who had come closest to breaking the stalemate for Argentina in the last minute of regulation time.

Messi sent Ezequiel Lavezzi through on the left and he crossed to Higuain at the far post but the striker put the ball in the side netting.

Copa America,Copa America: Brazil crash out on penalties,"Derlis Gonzalez slotted two penalties, one in regular time and again in the shootout, to help Paraguay knock Brazil out of the 2015 Copa America.

Paraguay won 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw that helped them seal a last-four match against Argentina, their second in the tournament having fought back from two goals down for a 2-2 draw in the teams’ opening group match.









It was the second tournament in succession that Paraguay have beaten Brazil on penalties at the quarter-final stage after 2011 when they went on the reach the final.

Featured: The psychology of penalty shootouts

Robinho started and finished a fine move in the 15th minute to put Brazil ahead before Gonzalez equalised with 20 minutes to go when he converted a penalty after a hand ball by Thiago Silva.

Gonzalez then netted the decisive Paraguayan penalty with the fifth spot kick to take his side through.

We had chances to kill the game off. Paraguay, with all respect, aren't one of the best sides.

“Unfortunately, our game dropped in the second half,” said Robinho.

“We had chances to kill the game off. Paraguay, with all respect, aren’t one of the best sides. We didn’t kill the game and unfortunately we lost a goal with a silly mistake and we lost.”

Brazil had won 12 of their previous 13 matches since Dunga took charge after last year’s World Cup.

They had more possession in the first half and weaved some good attacks but Paraguay were quick and dangerous on the break.

In the shootout, the writing was on the wall for Brazil from their second penalty which was put wide by Everton Ribeiro.

Another substitute, Douglas, missed their fourth to give Paraguay two penalties to settle the outcome.

Santa Cruz then skied his penalty, Philippe Coutinho gave Brazil hope by netting his but Gonzalez made no mistake.

Copa America,Costa Rica replace Japan in Copa America,"Costa Rica have accepted an invitation to replace Japan at the Copa America, the Central American country’s Football Federation president Eduardo Li said.

“We have taken the decision to take part in the Copa America,” said Li, whose squad will take one of two berths for guest teams in the July 1-14 tournament.









“We can go with an Olympic team, an under-23 (side) with five reinforcements basically over 23 years of age.”

Japan pulled out on Monday after failing to get the release of European-based players and facing a problem with J-League clubs, whose season has been extended into July following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country in March.

Costa Rica, guests at their fourth Copa America, will go into Group A with hosts Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia.

They held visiting Argentina to a 0-0 draw in a friendly in March.

“We want to raise the name of Costa Rica at international level and the more so in a tournament like this one,” added Li.

Butt keeper dropped

Meanwhile Mexico international goalkeeper Jesus Corona has been dropped by his country’s squad for the Concacaf Gold Cup in the United States next month.

His club, Cruz Azul, had two players suspended for six matches and coach Enrique Meza banned for three after a free-for-all that marred their Clausura championship semi-final defeat at Morelia on Sunday.

Morelia’s fitness coach Sergio Martin was banned for six matches and coach Tomas Boy for five for their part in the fracas sparked by Cruz Azul players when a home fan ran on to the pitch near the end with the score 3-0 to Morelia.

“Those sanctioned (for Cruz Azul) were six, (including Argentine midfielder) Christian Gimenez and (goalkeeper) Jesus Corona for six matches for…aggression against an opponent… on the pitch,” the Mexican Football Federation (Femexfut) said.

Meza and Cruz Azul striker Isaac Romo, who was sent off with Gimenez after the fracas, were suspended for three matches.

Two other members of the Cruz Azul coaching staff were handed two and three-match bans.

Morelia forward Miguel Sabah, who was also red-carded, was banned for three matches.

Corona and Martin were arguing off the pitch near the end of the fighting when the goalkeeper head-butted the Argentine, an incident the referee missed but which was filmed by TV Azteca.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2011/5/18/costa-rica-replace-japan-in-copa-america,NEGATIVE,0.9969596862792969
Copa America,Copa America: Brazil through to quarter-finals,"Thiago Silva and Roberto Firmino scored either side of half-time to fire Brazil to a 2-1 win over Venezuela at the Copa America, sending the five-time world champions into a quarter-final meeting with Paraguay.

The victory completed the quarter-final line up that will see hosts Chile face Uruguay on Wednesday, Peru take on Bolivia on Thursday, and Colombia line up against Argentina on Friday.









The Brazil-Paraguay tie will take place on Saturday.

Defender Thiago Silva, recalled to the side for this match, opened the scoring for Brazil after just nine minutes when he volleyed home a corner from Robinho.

Firmino doubled their lead six minutes into the second half when he leapt to volley home a cross from Willian on the left.

Nicolas Fedor got a consolation goal for Venezuela six minutes from time when he stooped to head home from close range after Jefferson had touched a free kick from Juan Arango onto the post.

Earlier, Colombia were left sweating on their Copa America hopes after a lacklustre 0-0 draw with Peru.

Colombia did manage to progress with a third-place finish with Peru finishing runners-up.

“We didn’t play well and we’re suffering,” Colombia’s James Rodriguez said.

“We need to look at ourselves and recognise that when we don’t score we have to take responsibility.”

Chile beat Argentina in the final for the second straight year, 4-2 in the penalty shootout following a 0-0 tie that ended an expanded 16-nation edition in the US to mark the championship’s 100th anniversary.

It was the third consecutive defeat at a major international tournament for Messi and his teammates after losing out to Germany in the World Cup in 2014, and the two Copa America defeats to Chile in 2015 and 2016.

Messi, winner of four Champions League titles and eight Spanish La Liga crowns with Barcelona, was also a member of Argentina’s Copa America team that lost to Brazil in 2007.

Messi says he is done with playing for Argentina after losing second consecutive Copa America final to Chile.

— Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish)June 27, 2016



Al Jazeera’s Daniel Schweimler, reporting from the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, after the final, said that “great despondency was descending on Argentina” following the three consecutive final losses.

“There is this great generation of players – including Messi, Angel Di Maria, Sergio Aguero, so many wonderful players – yet they are unable to win a major tournament.

“They are reaching the finals but they just don’t seem to have what it takes to be able to get their hands on those trophies. I think there’s a great deal of soul-searching, a great deal of questioning now about to take place here in Argentina.”

Argentina have not won a major senior title since the 1993 Copa America.

Messi wept on the pitch of the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey as Chile’s players celebrated their second consecutive win.

“There is no limit to this team,” Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal said. “We will keep going, we will keep fighting.”

“Argentina have a very good, world-class team, and it is especially beautiful to beat them,” said striker Eduardo Vargas.

“We are a historic group. We have proved it.”

Following an ill-tempered evening that included a first-half sending-off for both teams and eight yellow cards, the game was goalless throughout normal time and 30 minutes of extra time.

Copa America,Qatar seek to upset Lionel Messi’s Argentina in Copa America,"Copa Americaguest teams Japan and Qatar are still in contention as the last round of group stage matches begins, and some of their South American opponents are not too pleased.

Qatar and Japan, who met in the Asian Cup final in February, are in third place in their groups. The top two in each of the three groups qualifies for the quarterfinals but only the two best third-place finishers advance.









If winless Argentina is prematurely eliminated, Group B rival Qatar could be responsible after being given entry to the Copa America to help preparations for the 2022 World Cup.

Asian championQatar has so far drawn with Paraguay 2-2 and lost to Colombia 1-0.

“We have come to compete, not to take pictures, even if we admire the players of the teams we are facing,” Qatar’s Spanish coach Felix Sanchez said on Saturday.

“Our main goal is to evaluate ourselves in a tournament of this calibre, so demanding.”

Sanchez’s team on Sunday has the chance to upsetLionel Messi‘s Argentina, which has only one point from two games.

“It would be beautiful to qualify no matter if it is against a monster like Argentina,” said Sanchez, whose contract was extended until 2022 after winning the Asian Cup. “It will be a great step, even though we know they are also trying to advance to the next stage.”

The Qataris have already been invited to return to next year’s Copa, which is being hosted by Colombia and Argentina. Australia will be another guest side.

Japan has brought an under-23 team to Brazil that is being groomed for the Tokyo Olympics next year.

Japan was thrashed by Chile 4-0 but held favourite Uruguay to 2-2 after leading twice.

On Monday, the young Japanese can eliminate Ecuador to advance and, depending on other results, possibly face host Brazil in the quarterfinals on Thursday.

Venezuela coach Rafael Dudamel is particularly upset with Japan’s decision to bring its Olympic team.

“I do not agree that a guest like Japan gives due importance to its participation by coming with players that are mostly under 23,” Dudamel said Saturday after Venezuela beat Bolivia 3-1 and qualified to the quarterfinals of Copa America.

“I raise my voice and say Copa America needs to be only for South American teams,” he added. “We have not seen South American teams be invited to the African Cup of Nations, tournaments in Europe… We have to respect the hierarchy that we have historically built.”

There is nothing unusual about guest teams being invited to the Copa America.

Mexico, Costa Rica, United States, Jamaica, Honduras, Panama, Canada and Japan have all played past tournaments. Mexico had the best result among those, reaching the final in 1993 and in 2001.

Still, Paraguay coach Eduardo Berizzo said he does not like the idea of teams outside of the Americas being given slots.

“Playing among all American teams, that is logic,” Berizzo said after drawing Qatar. “We should think of a Copa America with Central and North Americas integrated. I never saw any European cup with South American teams. I strongly believe that Copa America needs to be played by American teams.”

Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez said business was the main reason to invite teams to the Copa America.

“We are few countries in South America to organize a tournament with 10 teams, even more so with four phases like in a World Cup,” Tabarez said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2019/6/23/qatar-seek-to-upset-lionel-messis-argentina-in-copa-america,NEGATIVE,0.9885057210922241
Copa America,Brazil kick off under-fire Copa America with win over Venezuela,"Brazil has kicked off Copa America 2021 with a 3-0 win over COVID-hit Venezuela as the much-opposed tournament kicked off in Brasilia on Sunday.

Marquinhos, Neymar and Gabriel Barbosa scored in the opening game at Mane Garrincha stadium on Sunday, less than a day after several Venezuelan players tested positive for COVID-19.

South American football governing body, CONMEBOL, chose Brazil as host two weeks ago despite its alarming COVID-19 figures, after Argentina and Colombia were dropped as co-hosts.

Despite his opposition to staging the tournament in his home country, Brazil captain Casemiro said the defending champions intended to retain their trophy.

“It could be a friendly, Copa America or World Cup qualifiers, we play it to win,” said Casemiro after his side’s win.

“Venezuela had the idea of defending, they wanted a draw. But we were focused and we were aggressive in the last third of the pitch.”

Venezuela summoned 15 new players at short notice after eight squad members tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday, and the disruption showed on the field.

Brazil opened the scoring in the 23rd minute after a corner kick ended with Marquinhos striking from close range.







Brazil coach Tite – who also opposed holding the tournament – took Lucas Paqueta off at halftime, but kept Roberto Firmino on the bench. Instead, Everton Ribeiro went on and provided more dynamism on the right flank.

Ribeiro found Danilo on the right edge of the box, and the Brazilian was pushed to the ground. Neymar calmly scored from the spot in the 63rd to make it 2-0.

Neymar dribbled past Graterol and crossed for Barbosa to chest the ball into the empty net in the 89th to seal the home side’s win.

Copa America,Copa America: Argentina edge out Uruguay,"Sergio Aguero’s superb diving header gave Argentina a 1-0 victory over River Plate rivals Uruguay at the Copa America.

Aguero met a 56th-minute cross from his Manchester City teammate Pablo Zabaleta and buried an unstoppable effort past Uruguayan goal-keeper Fernando Muslera at his front post.

















Argentina coach Gerardo Martino was banished to the stands for arguing with the match officials after just half an hour of a stormy encounter which frequently threatened to boil over.

The result left Argentina and Paraguay level at the top of Group B with four points each, ahead of Uruguay on three.

Earlier, a blunder by Jamaica goal-keeper Duwayne Kerr gifted Paraguay a 1-0 win.

Midfielder Victor Caceres played a long ball out of the Paraguay half for Edgar Benitez to chase and Kerr’s attempt at a clearing header bounced straight off the striker’s thigh and into the net in the 35th minute.

Jamaica, in the tournament for the first time as a guest team and warming up for the CONCACAF Gold Cup in the United States starting on July 7, have no points after they also lost their first game 1-0 to Uruguay.

Copa America,Copa America: Argentina thrash Paraguay to reach final,"Lionel Messi helped set up five goals as Argentina trounced Paraguay 6-1 to reach the final of the 2015 Copa America.

Angel di Maria scored twice and Marcos Rojo, Javier Pastore, Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain also found the net in a brilliant display orchestrated by an inspired Messi.









Gerardo Martino’s side took the lead after 15 minutes when Messi swung a free kick in from the left, Rojo failed to connect cleanly with his first touch but swept the ball home from close range with his second.

Argentina doubled their lead 12 minutes later and again Messi was the provider, threading an inch-perfect pass through the Paraguayan defence for Pastore to run on to.

His powerful low shot gave goalkeeper Justo Villar no chance.

Lucas Barrios gave Chile hope with a goal just before the break but minutes into the second half Pastore burst through midfield and fed Di Maria, who buried a left-foot shot into the bottom corner of the net.

Six minutes later Messi destroyed the Paraguayan defence with a mazy run to set up Pastore. His shot was parried by Villar but Di Maria was on hand to slot home the rebound.

On 80 minutes Di Maria turned provider, crossing from the left for Aguero to head home, and minutes later Higuain came off the bench to score a sixth.

Argentina had scored only four goals in their four previous matches but Messi said it was not because the team had not been playing well.

“We talked about that just before the match and we said it was just chance that we hadn’t scored more because we’ve been playing well,” Messi said.

“Today all the goals came at once.”

Copa America,Winless Paraguay reach Copa America final,"Paraguay advanced to the Copa America final with another penalty shootout victory in Wednesday’s semi-final against Venezuela.

Paraguay, who are still to win a match in the tournament, earned their place in Sunday’s title match in Buenos Aires – the first in the competition since 1979 – 5-3 on penalties after a goalless draw in Mendoza.









The only miss in the shootout came when Justo Villar stopped Franklin Lucena’s shot. Dario Veron netted the final spot kick, sending Paraguay through to face Uruguay, who beat Peru 2-0 in Tuesday’s semi-final.

Venezuela, known more for baseball, twice hit the post in extra time but came up just short of reaching their first ever final in the South American championship.

Paraguay also eliminated Brazil on penalties in the quarter-finals, having advanced to the knockout rounds as the third-placed team after three draws in group play.

“Today we played bad, we played good,” said Paraguay’s Nestor Ortigoza. “The important thing is we won.”

After the shootout, a brawl between the teams started as Paraguay celebrated, and police intervened.

That came after a game in which Paraguay had their coach and assistant coach expelled from the sideline for arguing decisions.

Nestor Ortigoza, Lucas Barrios, Cristian Riveros and Osvaldo Martinez also netted for Paraguay in the shootout.

“We came convinced we could advance,” Venezuela coach Cesar Farias said. “We did everything humanly possible. Our team never lost its focus… We’re not content because we worked to go farther.”

After a lacklustre 90 minutes, the best chances fell to Venezuela in extra time.

Maldonado fired a cross shot that was deflected by Fedor onto the post in the 93rd minute.

A few minutes later, Juan Arango’s long-range free kick struck Villar’s far post and Paraguay’s defenders barely cleared the rebound.

Fedor came close again in the 96th, but his shot from close range was saved by Villar.

Venezuela were able to pressure even more after Jonathan Santana was sent off in the 102nd minute for receiving a second yellow card.

Villar had to make another stop on a shot by Salomon Rondon from near the penalty spot, and Gabriel Chichero shot wide from the top of the area in the 114th.

Venezuela had made it through to the Copa America semi-finals for the first time in their history by beating Chile 2-1 in the quarters.

With the 45,000-capacity Malvinas Argentinas stadium less than half-full on a cold night, those fans on hand saw a game of few scoring opportunities before Venezuela’s extra time flourish.

Paraguay were again without striker Roque Santa Cruz, who had already missed the quarter-final against Brazil because of a muscle injury in his right leg.

The powerful striker came on as a substitute in the 73rd, but only lasted seven minutes before having to go off.

Copa America,Copa America: Argentina knock Colombia out on penalties,"Argentina moved into the semi-finals of the Copa America after beating Colombia 5-4 on penalties.

Argentina’s 90-minute onslaught failed to give them the goal they deserved as normal time ended in a stalemate.









Carlos Tevez got the winner with Argentina’s seventh spot kick in what was a thrilling end to a great tie.

Colombian goal-keeper David Ospina was the man of the match, making some remarkable stops to keep his side in the game.

The Arsenal keeper made a miraculous double save in the 25th minute when he dived to keep out a point blank shot from Sergio Aguero with his legs and then got up to parry away Lionel Messi’s header from the rebound.

He also did just enough to tip a shot from Nicolas Otamendi onto the post with 10 minutes left. Jeison Murillo scooped the ball off the line with seconds to go as Argentina piled on the pressure.

Copa America,Copa America fever hits Argentina,"Carlos Tevez will line up alongside Lionel Messi in Argentina’s attack when the hosts open the Copa America against Bolivia in La Plata on Friday.

Coach Sergio Batista said the decision was part of the tactics he had devised for Messi to have a brilliant tournament and inspire Argentina to clinch the South American title they last won in 1993.









Less than a month ago, Tevez appeared out of the running for a place in Argentina’s squad but he and Batista cleared the air over issues that had kept the striker out of the reckoning and he has impressed the coach in training.

“Carlos will play because he can link much more with Lionel and the idea is not to have players of such speed as we would have if (Angel) Di Maria and (Ezequiel) Lavezzi played (either side of Messi)… With Carlos we have more play,” Batista told reporters on Thursday.

“I don’t go by popular clamour. If I say Tevez must play it’s because that’s best for the national team”

Argentina coach Sergio Batista

Batista, who has dropped Di Maria to the bench to make way for Tevez, denied he had bowed to popular demand and media pressure to include the Manchester City captain.

“I don’t go by popular clamour. If I say Tevez must play it’s because that’s best for the national team. He has earned his place on his own,” Batista said.

Batista said he had alternative tactics if Messi were suffocated by Bolivian marking.

“We discussed Messi getting man-to-man marking and we have a plan B, someone (else) who will take control of the team and the ball,” he said.

“Lionel must enjoy what he’s doing, he’s a great player, the world’s best, and we’ll take maximum advantage of that. We built a team for him and let’s hope it’s his Copa America.”

Late entry

While most eyes are on Argentina’s tournament curtain-raiser against Bolivia, Colombia and Costa Rica are gearing up for their Copa America opener on Saturday at Jujuy.

Although the Argentinians are hot favourites to win Group A, second spot looks up for grabs and Costa Rica will be doubly keen to make the most of their last-minute invite following the withdrawal of Japan owing to the fallout from the deadly tsunami three months ago.

Coach Ricardo La Volpe will in particular hope for a strong showing as he wants to show what his Central Americans are made of, particularly as his side will later go up against his Argentinian compatriots.

La Volpe is Buenos-Aires born and was the reserve goalkeeper in the 1978 Argentine World Cup side but this month his loyalties are firmly with the ‘Ticos’ as they look to make the most of their invitation to the party for the fourth time after 1997, 2001 and 2004.

Colombian counterpart Hernan Darío ‘Bolillo’ Gomez will likewise be expecting his side to get off to a flier as they target a second win after 2001, when they lifted the crown on home soil.

“If we don’t get through the first round of the Copa America then I’m off – that much is clear. That is, I shan’t so much just go; they’ll fire me”

Colombia coach Hernan Dario Gomez

Whereas Costa Rica have a largely inexperienced side the Colombians will be expecting their strikeforce of Porto star Radamel Falcao Garcia and Teofilo Gutierrez, who plys his league trade in Argentina with Racing Club, to put three early points on the scoreboard.

Even if the likes of former greats Faustino Asprilla and Carlos Valderrama are no longer around to call upon, Gomez certainly expects the ‘cafeteros’ to get through the pool.

“If we don’t get through the first round of the Copa America then I’m off – that much is clear. That is, I shan’t so much just go; they’ll fire me,” said Gomez as he looked forward to the opening encounter.

Like many of the teams here – though Argentina want to break an 18-year trophy drought and also prevent a Brazilian hattrick of wins – Colombia are primarily preparing for the 2014 World Cup.

Gomez notes that while he believes he has a good team in the making he must look to 2014 as the goal as “Colombia haven’t been to the last three World Cups so that’s 13 years we have not been doing well and we are starting from zero.”

He added that he was wary of Costa Rica as he much respected La Volpe as a coach.

Even so, Costa Rica will be underdogs in that their main squad was just recently in action at the Gold Cup, hence they will be missing some of their more experienced names such as Bryan Ruiz, Marcos Urena and keeper Keylor Navas.

Copa America,Uruguay beat Paraguay for Copa America title,"Uruguay won the Copa America for a record 15th time after beating Paraguay 3-0 with two goals by Diego Forlan and another from Luis Suarez.

Suarez scored in the 12th minute during Sunday’s final in Buenos Aires, while Forlan hit the target in the 42nd and in the final minute of the game.









The victory gave Uruguay their first Copa America title since 1995, and made them the most successful side in the South American tournament.

The small country of 3.5 million also reached the World Cup semi-finals a year ago, surpassing the performance of continental powers Brazil and Argentina.

Suarez gave Uruguay the lead. Receiving a pass in the area, the Liverpool forward beat defender Dario Veron to score from a deflected left-footed shot that went in off the far post behind keeper Justo Villar.

Uruguay could have led in the second minute, when Villar stopped Diego Lugano’s point-blank header.

Forlan – voted the best player at last year’s World Cup – made it 2-0 by lashing a left-footed shot from 12 metres that left Villar flat-footed. He was set up after teammate Egidio Arevalo Rios had stolen the ball in midfield.

The Atletico Madrid striker had not scored in his 12 previous matches for the national team.

Sebastian Eguren almost made it 3-0 in the 74th, foiled when Villar stuck out his left arm with the ball headed for the net.

Forlan notched the final goal in the 90th minute, taking a pass from Suarez and scoring into the far corner.

Player down

Paraguay, who won Copa America titles in 1979 and 1953, played without injured forward Roque Santa Cruz and winger Aureliano Torres.

Paraguay Coach Gerardo Martino and top assistant Jorge Pautasso were suspended from the match after being sent off for repeatedly arguing with the referee in Wednesday’s victory over Venezuela.

Martino, an Argentine, is seen as a leading contender to take over Argentina’s national team.

The Argentine federation was to meet on Monday and decide on the future of coach Sergio Batista, who is reported to be on the way out.

For their part, Argentina and Brazil were again upset in the quarter-finals of the Copa America. Uruguay ousted Argentina on penalties and Paraguay eliminated Brazil, also in a shootout.

Argentina have won the title 14 times, Brazil eight. Brazil had won four of the past five titles.

Meanwhile, in Uruguay, thousands celebrated while watching a huge screen outside the Montevideo city hall, shooting off flares, waving flags and singing.

With their conquering heroes expected back home late on Sunday night, they planned to keep partying well into the night in the streets of the capital.

Copa America,Colombia first to reach Copa America quarters,"Argentina and Costa Rica will fight for second place in Copa America Group A after Colombia beat Bolivia 2-0 to reach the last eight.Radamel Falcao scored twice in Santa Fe on Sunday as Colombia took seven points from their three matches, the best return of the tournament so far, to qualify for a quarter-final against the best third-placed team from the three groups in Cordoba next Saturday.

Bolivia were eliminated.Falcao is now joint top scorer of a low-scoring tournament with a tally of two, equal with Peru’s Paolo Guerrero, and the team went through without conceding a goal.









“These results put us in the quarter-finals with authority,” Colombia’s coach Hernan Dario Gomez told the post-match news conference.“Our objective is not to go looking for a goalscorer but our identity as a team,” he said after Falcao scored the goals but Colombia created chances for several different players.

Porto striker Falcao put the Colombians ahead after a quarter of an hour when he ran onto winger Dayro Moreno’s defence-splitting ball down the left to steer it past goalkeeper Carlos Arias.

Colombia went further head close to the half hour with a penalty converted by Falcao after defender Santos Amador brought down left back Pablo Armero.

It was the second penalty of the tournament and the second faced by Arias after he saved one from Costa Rica’s Joel Campbell in Bolivia’s 2-0 defeat in Jujuy on Thursday.

“With the attitude of going out to win all the matches we knew things would happen for us. Today we got first place but if we don’t make the most of it in the next match, it stops there. We want to carry on dreaming,” Falcao told reporters.

Midfielder Adrian Ramos almost made it three when his header from a perfect high cross from Armero went just over the bar.

Colombia’s goalkeeper Luis Martinez had trouble turning away a free kick from midfielder Ronald Garcia near the end of the first half and Jhasmany Campos had a half chance for Bolivia early in the second but his effort went over.

Colombia created several chances to increases their lead with Falcao shooting wide from the best after being set up by substitute Hugo Rodallega, who later had a shot on target deflected by a defender.

Copa America,Copa America: Peru set up a Chile semi-final,"Peru striker Paolo Guerrero scored a hat-trick to give his side a comfortable 3-1 victory over Bolivia at the Copa America, setting up a last-four showdown with hosts Chile.

Guerrero scored twice in three minutes midway through the first half to put the Peruvians in the driving seat in their quarter-final clash.









His first was a header from a Juan Vargas cross, his second came on the counter-attack after a corner, and his third arrived in the 74th minute when Bolivian midfielder Danny Bejarano gifted him the ball with a misplaced pass and left him one-on-one with the goal-keeper.

Marcelo Moreno scored a late consolation from the penalty spot after Damian Lizio had been tripped in the box but Peru were never in danger of losing and will face Chile in Santiago on Monday in the first of the Copa semi-finals.

“We’re getting better and better,” said Guerrero, who is closing in on Teofilo Cubillas’ all-time scoring record for Peru.

Copa America,Copa America: Brazil’s Jesus sent off after flying kick in QF win,"Brazil striker Gabriel Jesus was sent off after hitting Chile’s Eugenio Mena with a flying kick in the 48th minute of Copa America quarter-final at Estadio Nilton Santos in Rio de Janeiro on Friday.

Defending champions Brazil advanced to the semi-finals with a 1-0 win after substitute Lucas Paqueta scored the only goal of the match.

Paqueta’s winner to the left corner of Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo in the 46th minute gave Brazil fans some hope that the Selecao would ease into the next stage.

But only two minutes later, Jesus was sent off after hitting Chile’s Eugenio Mena with a flying kick.

RED CARD FOR JESUS 🟥

Neymar and Brazil coach Tite said after the match that Jesus did not see Mena and accidentally kicked him as he tried to recover possession in the midfield.

“Defending well is a characteristic of ours,” Brazil’s Thiago Silva said. “Regardless of what we did today we concede few goals. Ever down to 10 we created clear opportunities. I am very proud of this team, for its fighting spirit.”

Paqueta replaced Roberto Firmino after a tense first half with few opportunities for both sides.

An exhausted Neymar said after the match that playing with 10 men was a great test for Brazil.

“Every match we need to get some tests to make us stronger, show we can do it in every circumstance,” Neymar said. “We had to stand together. It was very hard to do it.”

Chile’s Arturo Vidal said his team will leave the tournament with some pride.

“We lost to a great team, a favourite which is playing at home,” he said. “If we play like we played today, with some more time to work, this team will clearly have its intensity back. We hope to qualify to the World Cup. It will be hard, but we can.”

Peru advanced to the semi-final after beating Paraguay 4-3 on penalties after a 3-3 score in regular time.

byRamon Diaz,  Paraguay coach

Hosts Chile will face Peru in Santiago on Monday before favourites Argentina take on Paraguay in Concepcion on Tuesday.









All four teams have Argentine coaches: Chile are led by Jorge Sampaoli, Peru by Ricardo Gareca, Argentina by Gerardo Martino and Paraguay by Ramon Diaz.

“It’s a source of great happiness for the whole country that we not only have top-class players but also top-class coaches,” Diaz said after his side disposed of Brazil in a penalty shootout.

Six of the 12 coaches who started the competition were Argentine. Five of those progressed to the last-eight.

“There are six Argentine coaches and that means that at international level, coaches, just like players, have shown they can do well in these kind of tournaments,” Diaz added.

Gareca is in charge of Peru at his first international tournament, while Gustavo Quinteros was in the dugout for Ecuador.

Copa America,Brazil crash out of Copa America,"Paraguay, who did not have a single shot on target in 120 minutes of a goalless Copa America quarter-final, sent holders Brazil crashing out 2-0 on penalties on Sunday.

Brazil joined hosts Argentina, their rivals in the previous two finals, in going out of the tournament at the same stage after Argentina lost on penalties to Uruguay on Saturday.









Brazil dominated the 120 minutes of play which ended 0-0, creating a string of chances which Paraguay repelled with a mix of stubborn defending, some luck and a man-of-the-match performance from goalkeeper and captain Justo Villar.

The teams were down to 10 men each from the 13th minute of extra time after a scramble for the ball by several players on one side of the pitch developed into a free-for-all with Paraguay defender Antolin Alcaraz and Brazil midfielder Lucas Leiva sent off.

The Brazilians, brilliant at times in open play, were dismal in the shootout with Elano, Andres Santos and Fred all firing their penalties wide while Villar saved from Thiago Silva.

Edgar Barreto missed Paraguay’s first penalty but Marcelo Estigarribia and Cristian Riveros converted theirs.

“It was a match dominated almost entirely by Brazil. We had to take refuge a lot of the time at the back and, well, the penalties are a lottery which we took well and they failed with theirs,” Villar said.

“You need more than will to win matches, you need goals and all Brazil lacked was goals,” Brazil coach Mano Menezes told a news conference.

“Our opponents have not won a match (at the tournament),” he added after Paraguay qualified with three draws including 2-2 against Brazil in their group.

Brazil had the best moves of the first half. In the seventh minute, Robinho ran from the right across to the left and fed Pato whose pass back into the middle was only half-cleared with Neymar volleying the ball just over the bar.

They should have scored close to the half hour when Paulo Henrique Ganso passed forward to Robinho who threaded a good ball out right to the unmarked Neymar whose low shot went just outside the far post.

Villar saves

Left back Andre Santos took a 33rd-minute free kick, putting it low into the edge of the six-yard box where centre back Lucio broke through but had his effort blocked by Villar.

Andre Santos shot over when set up by midfielder Ramires’s diagonal pass from deep on the right as the first half wound down.

Brazil got back to business right away in the second half as Maicon set up Neymar for a shot that was scrambled away to Maicon, whose shot was also blocked.

Ganso had a brilliant low shot saved by Villar at the base of the near post in the 67th and five minutes later the goalkeeper blocked a point-blank effort from Pato.

Pato looked set to score in the 82nd when put through by Robinho but Villar blocked his effort and the striker headed the rebound into the side-netting from a tight angle.

As Brazil continued to pound the Paraguay defence, substitute Fred’s header from a corner was cleared off the line by Barreto.

Two minutes from the end a shot by Barreto appeared to hit Thiago Silva’s arm as he blocked it and striker Nelson Haedo Valdez also came close with a shot from outside the box.

Paraguay had their best of very few chances two minutes from the end of extra time but Haedo Valdez volleyed Estigarribia’s left cross wide of Julio Cesar’s right-hand post.

Venezuela-Chile

Venezuela beat Chile 2-1 to reach the semifinals of the Copa America for the first time in their history.

Left-back Gabriel Cichero scored their winning goal nine minutes from time, stabbing the ball home from close range after Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo had parried a free kick.

Centre-back Oswaldo Vizcarrondo had given the Venezuelans the lead with a header from a set piece in the 35th minute before Humberto Suazo equalised for Chile in the 70th minute.

Both teams ended the match with 10 men, Chile’s Gary Medel and Venezuela’s Tomas Rincon sent off in the closing minutes.

Copa America,Copa America: Brazil beat Peru with injury-time winner,"An injury-time goal from Douglas Costa gave Brazil a barely deserved 2-1 win over a plucky Peru side in the Copa America.

Substitute Costa slipped the ball past the keeper from close range in the 48th minute of the second half to break the deadlock and extend Brazil’s winning run to 11 matches.









Peru got off to a dream start after just three minutes with an unexpected opener to Christian Cueva.

David Luiz failed to clear a long ball and goal-keeper Jefferson passed the ball straight to Cueva who hammered it home from 10 yards out.

However, Peru’s lead lasted just two minutes. Dani Alves stroked a lovely cross into the box where an unmarked Neymar headed home his 44th international goal in 64 matches.

Earlier, Venezuela beat Colombia 1-0, the biggest upset of the tournament so far and their first victory over their South American neighbours in the history of the competition.

Striker Jose Salomon Rondon scored the only goal of the Group C match in the 60th minute in the central Chilean city of Rancagua.

Midfielder Rafael Ocosta swung in a deep cross from the right, Alejandro Guerra headed it back across goal and Rondon buried a firm header into the bottom lefthand corner of the Colombian net.

Copa America,‘Unsatisfied’ Brazil football team rules out Copa America boycott,"Brazil’s national football team has agreed to play in the upcoming Copa America despite concerns over the late decision tostage the continental tournamentin its home country.

The tournament, postponed from last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, was scheduled to be jointly hosted by Colombia and Argentina.

Colombia was dropped last month amid a wave of protests against President Ivan Duque while Argentina was ruled out due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in the country.

Brazil has reported more than 17 million cases of coronavirus. More than 476,000 people have died of the virus in the country whose death toll is second only to the US.

Experts have warned it is facing a new surge that could be exacerbated by a major international sports tournament.

On Wednesday, Brazilian players used social media to publish a message saying they are “unsatisfied” with South American football’s governing body, CONMEBOL, which decided to move the tournament to Brazil.







They said they did not want to make the organisation of Copa America a political debate though.

“We are against organizing the Copa America, but we will never say no to the Brazilian national team,” the players said in ajoint statement.

“We are a cohesive group, but with different ideas. For multiple reasons, humanitarian or of professional nature, we are unsatisfied with the leading of Copa America by CONMEBOL, no matter if it were hosted belatedly in Chile or in Brazil.

“All the recent facts make us believe it was an inadequate process.”

On Tuesday, the country’s Supreme Court said itwould rule on Thursdayon two requests to block the 10-nation tournament, which is scheduled to open Sunday and run through July 10.

Chief Justice Luiz Fux said given the “exceptional nature of the case”, he had decided to have the full 11-member court take up the matter in an extraordinary virtual session.

The players did not address the pandemic directly in their text.

Over the last week, local media reported many Brazilian players were not necessarily worried about COVID but felt they had to voice their criticism to the president of the Brazilian football confederation, Rogerio Caboclo, for deciding to move the tournament without consulting them.

Caboclo was suspended from his office on Sunday following a sexual harassment case in which he denies any wrongdoing.

The tournament has become a divisive, politically loaded matter in the country. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has regularly defied expert advice on containing the pandemic, gave his blessing to host it.

But epidemiologists have voiced alarm, as have Bolsonaro critics and some coaches and players from participating countries.

Brazil and Venezuela are scheduled to kick off the Copa America at the Mane Garrincha Stadium on Sunday evening in the capital Brasilia.

Copa America,Copa America: Neymar sees red after Brazil’s loss,"A first-half goal from Jeison Murillo gave Colombia a 1-0 win over Brazil at the Copa America in a game marred by ugly scenes at the final whistle that saw Neymar and Carlos Bacca shown red cards.

The defeat was Brazil’s first in 12 matches and the first game coach Dunga had failed to win since taking over following their disastrous 2014 World Cup.









“It’s never a good thing when at the end of a match we’re talking about the referee.

“I think if you look at what happened, including at the end, you have to conclude it has something to do with the referee.”

The scrappy game threw up few clear chances but Colombia put away the one that mattered to get the win over their illustrious rivals.

This was only their second victory in 10 Copa America encounters against the five-time world champions.

Colombia were the better side throughout with defender Murillo seizing on a loose ball to get the all-important goal nine minutes before half time after a Juan Cuadrado free kick had bobbled around in the box.

Neymar kicked the ball at Pablo Armero in frustration at the final whistle.

Scuffles broke out at the end of the match and Neymar and Bacca were both shown red cards.

The Brazilian had already been given a yellow and will miss Brazil’s next match against Venezuela and probably at least one more game.

“Referees need to show Neymar more respect,” Willian told television reporters after the game.

“He is always being targeted.”

Copa America,Uruguay reach Copa America final,"Uruguay are through to the final of the Copa America following a 2-0 win over Peru that keeps them on course for a record 14th title in the world’s oldest international football tournament.

Liverpool star Luis Suarez scored both second goals in La Plata to send the Uruguayans through to a meeting on Sunday with the winners of Thursday’s second semi-final between Paraguay and Venezuela.









“It was a very tough game in the first half and we lacked a little clarity though we kept trying to make chances,” said Suarez.

Referring to a more cagey affair against Copa America hosts and arch-rivals Argentina in the previous round, he told broadcaster TyC Sports: “This was a game where we had to come out and attack and fortunately that’s what we did.”

After a bright start by Peru, with Luis Advincula looking lively in midfield, Uruguay increasingly found their feet and began to boss the encounter.

Diego Forlan set up the first goal in the 53rd minute, taking a long, low shot that Peru keeper Raul Fernandez dived to his left to save. But Suarez swarmed on the rebound and sent the ball into the open net from a sharp angle with Fernandez sprawled on the ground.

Suarez struck again five minutes later when he took a pass near midfield that split two defenders, then broke for goal. When Fernandez came out to stop him, he stepped around to his right and rolled the ball into an open net.

Peru’s Juan Vargas was shown a red card in the 69th minute.

Peru had its best scoring chance in the 84th when Uruguay keeper Fernando Muslera leaped high to stop Paolo Guerrero’s long shot. The ball slipped from Muslera’s hand, but he covered up quickly just inches from the goal line.

Peru were the worst team in South American World Cup qualifiers just a year ago, but have been one of the surprises of the South American championship despite the absence of the team’s top two forwards, Jefferson Farfan and Claudio Pizarro.

Copa America,Argentina draw with Colombia in Copa America,"Argentina’s passage to the knock-out stage of the Copa America is in jeopardy after the hosts were held to a 0-0 draw by Colombia, in another disappointing performance by Lionel Messi and his big-name teammates.

The match on Wednesday was similar to Argentina’s 1-1 draw in its opening game against Bolivia, with coach Sergio Batista sticking with nearly the same starters, led by a misfiring Messi and Carlos Tevez.









Argentina’s two star forwards were outplayed by Colombia strikers Radamel Falcao and Dayro Moreno, who had more chances and perhaps should have given their team victory.

“We deserved three points,” Colombia defender Mario Alberto Yepes said. “We had the chances to win. We had a lot of attacks we didn’t finish.”

Argentina will need a victory in the final group match against Costa Rica, which is fielding largely an under-23 team, to guarantee passage to the second round.

Even beating a second-string Costa Rica may be tough for Argentina, which has scored one goal in 180 minutes.

Olympic-style squad

Costa Rica and Mexico are using inexperienced Olympic-style squads in this tournament because they are not part of the South American confederation and are playing as guests.

Their full-strength teams played in the just-completed Gold Cup for the CONCACAF region, which takes in North and Central America and the Caribbean.

The Argentina players left the pitch to boos and whistles from frustrated fans.

“One does not like to go off that way,” Batista said. “People come to see the team win, and that’s what we all want.”

Batista acknowledged that Colombia defended well against Messi. “They shut down the open spots, they knew how to play. They knew our game,” he said.

The national coach will be under pressure to engineer a result for the hosts, who were tipped by many to win the tournament and face Brazil in the final.

Batista took over from Diego Maradona after a disappointing World Cup but has failed to produce results for a nation starved for any major titles in 18 years.

Argentina has two points from two games in Group A. Colombia leads the group with four from two games.

Bolivia (one point from one game) and Costa Rica (zero points from one game) will play on Thursday.

The top two teams in the group advance automatically to the quarterfinals while the best two third-place teams from the three groups also advance.

Colombia outplayed Argentina in the first half with Falcao and Moreno each coming up with several threatening chances. Moreno came close after 20 minutes with two shots sailing just side.

Argentina again failed to get Messi into the match, although Ezequiel Lavezzi came close to scoring in the 34th, charging in off the right side with a shot that goalkeeper Luis Martinez saved with his right leg.

Falcao forced Argentine keeper Sergio Romero into a diving save in the 42nd on a long shot. Moreno made Romero dive again two minutes later with another threatening attack.

The second half was much the same, and again Colombia looked more dangerous.

Pablo Armero came close on a shot just across the face of goal in the 65th. Two minutes later Romero came up with a big save on Falcao.

Argentina finished with four forwards: Messi, Tevez, Gonzalo Higuain and Sergio Aguero, on the pitch in a desperate search for a goal, but still failed to create any genuine chances.

Messi had a good opportunity with a free kick from the top right corner of the penalty area in the 81st, but his attempt sailed 10m high and wide, and the Barcelona star dropping his head onto his chest in disappointment.

He also fell to the ground in first-half stoppage time, twisting his right ankle when his boot caught in the pitch.Messi has yet to produce his Barcelona form with Argentina, and each failed match adds more pressure on the 24-year-old, who left Argentina as a youth player and has spent his formative years in Spain.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2011/7/7/argentina-draw-with-colombia-in-copa-america,NEGATIVE,0.9958916902542114
Copa America,Venezuela beat Ecuador 1-0 in Copa America,"Brazil’s playmaker Paulo Henrique Ganso, right, laid on both goals for his side [Reuters]

An unfancied Venezuelan side upset Ecuador 1-0 to go to the top of Group B at the Copa America, while Brazil snatch a 2-2 draw with Paraguay after substitute Fred hit a last-minute equaliser.

Midfielder Cesar Gonzalez scored the goal on Saturday that stunned Ecuador and put Venezuela two points clear of Brazil and Paraguay with one match to go in their group.









The game was still scoreless as the second half got underway, but again it was Venezuela – thought by many to be the minnows of the group – who looked the more likely to make the break through.

Some slick passing saw them cut through the Ecuador defence, but again they were found lacking when it came to providing the scoring touch – a weak back heel from Miku proving easy to save once much of the hard work had been done.

But two minutes after the hour mark they eventually edged ahead with some clinical finishing.

Again, some good controlled passing saw them move into the Ecuador half with Cesar Gonzalez sprinting onto a loose ball and firing it into the bottom corner for a 1-0 lead.

Falling behind seemed to spur Ecuador to greater endeavour as they went in search of an equaliser.

Edson Montano made a strong run before passing to Felipe Caicedo who showed plenty of strength in stepping past three defenders but produced a woefully weak finish that Vega made light work of.

As the clock ticked down, they were unable to conjure an equaliser and Venezuela ran out 1-0 winners at the Padre Ernesto Martearena stadium in Salta, shaking off their tag as a baseball nation, by deservedly claiming only their third ever win in the competition.

Brazil snatch equaliser

Meanwhile, Brazil, for whom playmaker Paulo Henrique Ganso laid on both goals with similar defence-splitting passes, took the lead six minutes before halftime at the Mario Alberto Kempes stadium in Cordoba.

Midfielder Ramires gained possession at the breakdown of a Paraguay attack and fed Ganso, who touched the ball perfectly through to Jadson who wasted no time shooting from the edge of the area low into the bottom corner.

Roque Santa Cruz equalised 11 minutes after the interval when the Brazilian defence failed to clear Marcelo Estigarribia’s cross from the left into the middle of the box and the striker shot into the bottom corner past Julio Cesar.

Paraguay went ahead 12 minutes later when the ever-dangerous Estigarribia robbed Daniel Alves on the left of the area and squared to the middle where substitute Nelson Haedo Valdez’s shot came off Lucio, but he put it away at the second attempt.

Brazil snatched the equaliser when striker Fred took a perfect through pass into the box from Ganso and fired low past goalkeeper Justo Villar.

Paraguay coach Gerardo Martino, rather than ruing Brazil’s late equaliser, said he was pleased with the progress shown by his team in a tight tournament since they reached the last eight at the 2010 World Cup.

“Beyond the result, I can say that after two matches here, we have played better than in the World Cup and we have fewer points,” Argentine Martino told the post-match news conference.

Decisive final round

The goal by midfielder Jadson, replacing Robinho in the only change to Brazil’s side from the 0-0 draw with Venezuela in La Plata last Sunday, was the first in the group after the opening two matches had finished scoreless.

Mano Menezes, Brazil’s coach, regretting their defensive mistakes, said: “It would have been unfair to have come away from this match defeated. Paraguay did little to beat us.

“We had two other good chances that we missed through making the wrong choice [at the finish] … The final round of [group] games has become decisive because of what [the four teams] have done up to now.”

Copa America,Messi banned from international football for three months,"FootballerLionel Messihas been suspended from playing international matches forArgentinafor three months after alleging corruption at theCopa Americalast month.

South American football body CONMEBOL also handed Messi a $50,000 fine for his comments after Argentina’s 2-1 win against Chile in the third-place playoff of the tournament inBrazilin July.









Messi, Argentina’s captain, was red carded for only the second time in his career during the Chile match in Sao Paulo following a scuffle with Gary Medel, who was also sent off.

Messi avoided the medal ceremony in protest and later said Argentina “shouldn’t take part in this corruption”.

The Argentinian also said the tournament was set for hosts Brazil, whobeat Argentinain the semi-finals, to win.

He had also complained against Copa America refereeing after Argentina’s 0-2 loss to Brazil in the semifinals.

The governing body at the time called the accusations “groundless” and “unacceptable.”

Messi and Argentina still have one week to appeal the decision, which stops the striker from playing in four friendlies this year.

The 32-year-old, who also captains FC Barcelona, will not play for Argentina in September against Chile and Mexico, or in another two games in October.

Neither Messi nor Argentina’sfootballassociation has made comments about CONMEBOL’s decision.

Messi has already been fined $1,500 and is suspended from the first match of the South American World Cup qualifiers next March, for his Copa America red card.

When asked if he feared being suspended for his comments, he said: “The truth needed to be told.”

Messi later sent an apology to CONMEBOL for his remarks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2019/8/3/messi-banned-from-international-football-for-three-months,NEGATIVE,0.9936977028846741
Copa America,"Analysis: Messi, Neymar and the Copa America final","When Lionel Messi plays for his national team, Argentina, it often looks like he is carrying a burden. There seems to be little joy to his gestures. Argentinians, in the past, have also accused of playing without any emotion and that they could not identify with him.

For all the success he has had with his club, FC Barcelona, that made Messi the best player of his generation, the same cannot be said for the national team. Though the 34-year-old had team success with the national team at youth level, the last major trophy won by the men’s national team was the Copa America in 1993.









Before that, Argentina had won the Copa America in 1991 and the World Cup in 1986. In the latter, the team was carried by the genius of Diego Maradona, the player whose shadow Messi has chased ever since. The 1991 and 1993 Copa America titles were won by a tight knit group of journeymen and hard workers such as Diego Simeone, who has since built a similar reputation as manager at Spanish champions Atletico Madrid.







On Saturday evening, at Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Messi leads Argentina in the final of the Copa America against Brazil. Many think it is his last chance to win a major trophy. He came close in 2014 when Argentina lost to Germany in the World Cup final (in the same stadium where tonight’s match will be played) and in 2016 when the Copa America celebrated its centenary with a final in New Jersey in the United States.

That night, Argentina lost to Chile in a penalty shoot-out. Messi took the first penalty and skied it into the crowd. It was the third final he had lost with Argentina in 10 years. After the game, he announced his retirement. However, he came back to play for the national team in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, where the team and Messi were eliminated 4-3 by eventual champions France in the round of 16.

In the aftermath of that 2018 World Cup exit, Jesica Paola Kessler, an Argentinian sports administrator, argued Argentinians judge the national team the same way they judge the country’s political management. “In each case, the scrutiny comes every four years and the one to take the blame is the charismatic leader,” shewrote.

While football and governance is usually teamwork, they blame or praise one player for the outcome.

“The same happens with governance. Whenever the charismatic leader appears, he or she acts as a messianic agent, who is seen as the only natural leader, with the right to rule and the only one qualified to govern and save the team or the country. When they fail, the people shout for their head,” Kessler said.

Maradona carried that burden in the 1980s and it took its personal toll by the end of that decade and subsequent one, while Messi has carried that burden since the late 2000s. It comes with the territory.

Fans watching the Copa America on TV – the games are being played in empty stadiums in Brazil; the tournament was moved there because of surging COVID-19 infections in Argentina and anti-government protests in Colombia – and journalists covering it have noticed, however, that Messi may be finally reconciling with Argentinian expectations. And it was most evident during Wednesday night’s semifinal against Colombia that had to be decided by penalties after a 1-1 regular time score.

Argentina’s goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was their hero, saving three of the shoutout penalties. But it was Messi, who converted his own spot kick, who received the most attention afterwards for his actions. As Martinez saved the penalty of Colombia’s Yerri Mina, a former Barcelona player known for his over-the-top celebrations, Messi balled his fists from the centre circle, and yelled at Mina, “How about dancing now?” This, combined with how Messi is carrying Argentina, has stood out. Of Argentina’s 11 team goals, Messi has scored four and assisted five others.

Not surprisingly, the final is billed as “Messi versus Neymar”, his former Barcelona team-mate. Like Argentina, Brazil’s global reputation is derived mostly from its success as a footballing nation. Its team, on paper, is stronger than Argentina and they are favourites. With Neymar upfront, they breezed through the group and knockout stages. But many Brazilians cannot relate to the team. The majority of the squad play in Europe.

Danê Jaheem Sosaba, a writer and researcher in Sao Paolo, says this generation of Brazilian national team players lack the abundance of superstars as the 2002 world champions, for instance, that had the likes of likeable players such as Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. “Most Brazilians would not be able to name many other first-team players besides Neymar, so they put a lot of hope just on him.”

But the alienation from the team is also related to the country’s current political and health crisis. Brazil has avery unpopularright-wing government led by President Jair Bolsonaro, who admires the country’s military dictatorship which ruled violently in the 1960s. Bolsonaro has also downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. His country has had a total of 19 million cases and more than half a million deaths thus far. In contrast, Argentina, whose centre-left government has been credited with managing the pandemic better, only has 4.6 million cases and 98,000 deaths.

According to Sosaba, many Brazilian fans and commentators could not help notice “the contrast between Bolsonaro’s quick reply to [continental football association] CONMEBOL’s proposal [to host the tournament] and his administration’s delayed reply to vaccine manufacturers”.

It does not help that many of Brazil’s national football team members, including Neymar, are supporters of Bolsonaro. Some of the players are devout charismatic or evangelical Christians, a group that forms the backbone of Bolsonaro’s base. An exception is the coach, Tite.

In the last week, one of the big talking points before the final was that a significant section of Brazilian fans will be supporting Argentina. Some of them say they are doing it for Messi; he deserves “justice” to win a competition wearing his national team shirt. At press conferences,  Brazil’s captain, Thiago Silva, and another senior team player, Marquinhos, expressed surprise at Brazilian fans’ negative attitude towards the team. Neymar also weighed in. He lambasted Brazilian fans on Instagram, accusing them of being unpatriotic. “I never attacked nor would I everattack Brazil if they are playing for something, whatever the sport, a model [beauty] contest, the Oscar … I am Brazil, and who is Brazilian and does it differently?” He ended that while he respected their choice, they should “go to hell”.

This may not have helped Neymar’s reputation among Brazilian fans. “As a football player, he is considered a failure when it comes to decisive moments, important games: he is often injured and does not play on those occasions,” says a political commentator, who is very critical of the government and who wanted to remain nameless. “His image is currently bad here in Brazil. I think many Brazilians trust Messi’s discreet and consistent style more,” in contrast to Neymar’s “rich kid” and “tacky and superficial” persona.

It is telling that one of Neymar’s most incisive critics this week was former Brazil international Walter Casagrande, who built a reputation as a centre forward at Corinthians in the 1980s. On a local TV sports programme, an agitated Casagrande likened Neymar to Bolsonaro. “I’ve never seen Neymar get angry with the crisis we are going through in Brazil. Neymar’s problem is that fans support Argentina, then he gets angry, then he thinks he’s a patriot, then he feels like a Brazilian. He thinks that being Brazilian is that? We have problems up to our foreheads … with people dying, vaccine discussions, and he is not angry about that. He is not angry about people who die because of the Bolsonaro government’s incompetence. He is not angry that the government didn’t move to buy vaccines and is suspected of bribes and embezzlement. Then he doesn’t get angry.”

In the end, Brazilians may not care. Sosaba says many Brazilians feel their government should not have hosted the tournament because of COVID-19 conditions. They sneer that this is a “Bolsonaro” or “COVID tournament”. Fans, who happened to be critics of Bolsonaro’s government, were emboldened when Tite and one of the squad players, Casemiro, first said they would consider boycotting the tournament over the government’s COVID-19 response. Bolsonaro’s supporters then accused Tite and his team of being “communists”, leading to the two backing down.

“Because of all of this [lead up], a lot of people are not caring about this edition of the Copa America, and it shows. The [local] TV network that is televising the tournament has failed most of the times to achieve and maintain high audience ratings during the matches,” Sosaba says.

Messi’s victory may be more empty in more ways than one.

Copa America,Menezes confident despite Brazil’s Copa exit,"Brazil’s elimination from the Copa America won’t derail the hosts’ preparations for the 2014 World Cup said coach Mano Menezes on Monday.

Menezes believes Brazil improved during the South American competition despite the elimination to Paraguay on penalties in the quarter-finals on Sunday, and expects the team to be at their best again soon.









“Brazil will not be stumbling in 2014,” Menezes said.

Trying to win their third straight Copa America title, Brazil exited the tournament after only one victory in four matches.

They struggled at the beginning but improved as the competition progressed.

“We had our best match by far against Paraguay. We always want to win and the result is important, but we can’t forget that we played very well on Sunday”

Coach Mano Menezes

The Brazilians outplayed Paraguay from the start on Sunday in La Plata but were unable to capitalise on numerous scoring opportunities, mostly because of a terrific performance by goalkeeper Justo Villar.

Brazil then failed in all four penalty attempts to lose 2-0 in the shootout.

“We have to look back and understand that we improved,” Menezes said.

“We had our best match by far against Paraguay. We always want to win and the result is important, but we can’t forget that we played very well on Sunday.”

Brazil also performed well in a 4-2 win over Ecuador in their last group match. The team started the tournament by drawing 0-0 with Venezuela and then drew 2-2 with Paraguay thanks to a last-minute equaliser.

Menezes, who replaced Dunga after Brazil’s disappointing elimination at the World Cup last year, is revamping the national team for the 2014 tournament.

The Copa America was seen as the coach’s biggest test so far. He brought a squad mixed with veterans and several promising young stars such as Neymar, Paulo Henrique Ganso and Alexandre Pato. Menezes is preparing them to lead the squad in 2014, when the pressure to win the title at home will be unprecedented.

Job safe

Menezes has coached Brazil in 12 matches with a record of six wins, two losses and four draws. The two losses came against Argentina and France, while the wins were against less successful teams such as Ukraine, Romania and Scotland.

The coach said he is not worried about losing his job despite the negative reaction in Brazil following Sunday’s elimination.

“I’ll be criticised just like all coaches are when they don’t win,” Menezes said.

“Humiliation” and “Incompetence”

Two of the headlines in Brazil’s papers following the defeat

“But it seems a (coaching) change now wouldn’t help. Argentina has been making changes and we saw that it didn’t solve anything.”

Argentina also disappointed in the Copa America, falling to Uruguay on Saturday in a penalty shootout.

The Brazilian football federation has already guaranteed Menezes will remain coach despite Sunday’s result, with president Ricardo Teixeira calling after the loss to reassure him that his position is safe.

He isn’t getting the same support back in Brazil, though.

“Humiliation,” read a Monday front-page headline in the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, Brazil’s largest.

“Incompetence,” said the O Globo daily in Rio de Janeiro.

Fans expressed their disappointment, too.

“These are the best players we have,” said 27-year-old building manager Gilmar Oliveira in Brasilia.

“I think the problem is the coach, that’s why we are going through this embarrassment.”

As host, Brazil won’t need to play in the South American World Cup qualifying tournament.

The team’s next official tournament will be the 2012 Olympics, a competition Brazil has never won, and they will then play in the 2013 Confederations Cup.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2011/7/18/menezes-confident-despite-brazils-copa-exit,NEGATIVE,0.5168721675872803
Copa America,Argentina on song in 3-0 Copa win,"Argentina shrugged off indifferent form in their first two matches to beat Costa Rica 3-0 in Cordoba and advance to the Copa America quarter-finals.

Sergio “Kun” Aguero opened the scoring in first-half stoppage time, and added a second just seven minutes into the second half of the match on Monday.









The 52nd minute goal came after Aguero was set up by a pass from Barcelona star Lionel Messi, who showed his best form of the tournament.

Angel di Maria, who plays his club football at Real Madrid, scored Argentina’s third in the 64th minute, sealing a win that revives pre-tournament expectations that the hosts would challenge for the title.

Argentina now have five points from three matches, having drawn their previous two encounters, and finish second in Group A. Colombia won the group with seven points.

Drought

Aguero is now the leading scorer in the tournament so far, with three goals. Argentina, playing on home soil, are seeking to end an 18-year drought in major tournaments.

Under the Copa America format, the top two sides from each of the three groups advance, being joined by the best two third-place teams.

Argentina will now face either Chile, Peru or Uruguay in the quarter-finals, depending on who finishes second in Group C. Colombia will face the third-placed team from those countries.

Groups B and C will be settled on Tuesday and Wednesday. Costa Rica have still not been eliminated, despite Monday’s loss, and await the outcome of other matches.

Argentina applied constant pressure in the first half, with Aguero breaking through just before the interval, slotting away a rebound past Costa Rica goalkeeper Leonel Moreira.

In the 52nd minute, he latched onto a through ball from Messi, tucking his shot inside the far post.

Messi set up the third goal, too, finding Di Maria, who slammed the ball into the back of the net from 15 yards out.

“I would like to thank Cordoba for the way you treated us, especially me,”Messi said afterwards.

“The truth is that we missed this affection, especially in the situation that we had arrived here in. Now it’s another Copa (America) and we will do our best for Argentina.”

Sergio Batista, the Argentina coach and former World Cup winner, fielded an attacking line-up, with Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Di Maria playing just in front of playmaker Messi.

Forwards Carlos Tevez and Ezequiel Lavezzi started on the bench, after having two poor matches in the tournament.

The new lineup looked far more settled, with Messi bossing the game as he has so far failed to do in the tournament.

Ricardo La Volpe, the Costa Rica coach, appeared to be playing for a draw from the start.

James Rodriguez scored from the penalty spot and had an assist to help Colombia edge world champions Argentina 2-1 in Barranquilla and Diego Gomez netted the winner for Paraguay in a 1-0 victory over Brazil at Asuncion on Tuesday.

Both Argentina and Brazil struggled without their injured stars, with the replacements for Messi and Neymar unable to deliver away wins for their teams.

It was sweet revenge for Colombia, who were beaten 1-0 by Argentina in a bitterly disappointing Copa America final loss as the World Cup 2022 winners also lifted the continental trophy in Miami in July. The Colombians seemed to have that match on their minds as they found a way to beat Argentina for the first time since 2019.

Yerson Mosquera opened the scoring for Colombia with a close-range header in the 25th minute but Argentina equalised in the 48th after Nico Gonzalez intercepted a Rodriguez pass. Rodriguez made amends on the hour with his penalty, awarded after a video review, securing the win at the Metropolitano Stadium.

“It is a great win against an Argentina team that has won it all,” Rodriguez said. “The weather was tough, it was so hot, but we had an excellent match. It is a fair win.”

Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said the heat had an impact on the match.

“The heat is the same for both, but it is evident that there were not good conditions for us to see a spectacle,” the coach said.

Gomez scored for Paraguay from the edge of the box, with the ball deflecting in off goalkeeper Alisson’s right post. Brazil had few opportunities to equalise and gave coach Dorival Junior his first defeat since taking over in January.

Brazil’s coach, usually reserved in front of the media, told a news conference on Monday that his team will be in the next World Cup final. The defeat at Paraguay suggested he is still miles away from delivering on that promise.

His idea of starting against a defensively sound Paraguay team with a trio of Real Madrid strikers – Vinicius Junior, Endrick and Rodrygo – clearly failed. Midfielder Lucas Moura said “the game was over” as soon as the hosts opened the scoring in the 20th minute.

“They already came to defend, even more so after they scored,” substitute Moura said.

Defender Marquinhos said Brazil’s squad doesn’t have “the usual confidence” in recent times.

“We are trying to find the best way to play,” he said. “There are many pieces being changed.”

In the other CONMEBOL qualifiers on Tuesday, Bolivia upset Chile 2-1 at Santiago, Ecuador beat Peru 1-0, and Venezuela drew 0-0 with Uruguay.

Argentina lead the round-robin competition with 18 points after eight matches, two points clear of Colombia. Uruguay are in third position with 15 points, followed by Ecuador with 14. Brazil have been pushed to fifth with 10 points.

Despite the defeat, Argentina remain comfortably on course for a place at the World Cup 2026, which is being co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

With the tournament expanded to 48 teams, the top six finishers in South American qualifying will win a berth to the finals.

Copa America,Five key takeaways from football’s 2024 CONCACAF Nations League final,"The United States have won their third straight CONCACAF Nations League title after beating Mexico 2-0 in the final, thanks to goals from Tyler Adams and Gio Reyna.

The final was played in front of a boisterous crowd supporting both teams at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on Sunday night.

The North American football tournament takes place every two years and is spread across dates allocated for international friendlies by FIFA. It determines the finalists for the CONCACAF Gold Cup and the region’s qualifiers for the CONMEBOL Copa America.

All 41 regional teams are divided into three tiers, with the top four teams from the top tier qualifying for knockout competition to determine the champion.

Here’s a look at the five talking points from the tournament:

The US men’s football team may not be as globally successful as their female counterparts, but they have been a dominant force in the North American region and have nudged ahead of their southern neighbours Mexico in recent decades.

This has fuelled a rivalry loaded with political and footballing sub-plots.

Once counted among the powerhouses of the continent, the El Tri – as the Mexican football team are known – has fallen behind the Stars and Stripes. Their last 36 meetings have resulted in 19 wins for the US and only nine for Mexico.

They have met twice in the CONCACAF Nations League final and the US has won on both occasions (2019 and 2024) — but Mexico holds a slight edge in the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Sunday’s game led to heated words being exchanged on the pitch, as well as fans throwing objects from the stands.

US coach Gregg Berhalter and some of his players were struck by debris while celebrating Gio Reyna’s 63rd-minute strike that put the home team 2-0 ahead.

“That was unfortunate because we want a really competitive game, we want a great atmosphere, but we don’t want to get things thrown at us,” Berhalter said post-game.

For the second straight year, the final was suspended in the closing minutes because of homophobic chants by pro-Mexican fans.

Canadian referee Drew Fischer twice stopped play: in the 88th minute, and again six minutes into stoppage time. The match was eventually completed, leading to the regional football body issuing a post-match statement condemning the “discriminatory chanting”.

“Security staff in the stadium identified and ejected a significant number of fans, and the referee and match officials activated the FIFA protocol… It is extremely disappointing that this matter continues to be an issue at some matches.”

Once the US were crowned CONCACAF Nations League champions, a celebratory Tyler Adams stood on the field cradling his two-month-old son Jax; the 25-year-old midfielder still grinning widely after scoring the goal of his life in his side’s 2-0 win.

In his first start in more than a year for club or country, Adams powerful strike from 35 metres thundered past the helpless Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, who’s well-timed lunge towards the right goalpost still couldn’t prevent the ball from rocketing past his right hand and into the back of the net.

“People have a lot of question marks about this, about that,” Adams said. “But to see what we do week in, week out when we have the opportunity to work together, we continue to grow.”

Adams has two goals in 38 matches for the US. The other came against Mexico in 2018.

The oft-injured midfielder made his first start for the US since the loss to Netherlands in the 2022 World Cup round of 16.

TYLER ADAMS……wow!!!! 🔥#USMNT

Earlier in the week, Berhalter motivated his players to win their third straight Nations League title by emulating the famous example of NBA legend Michael Jordan and the 1991-93 Chicago Bulls.

“The Jordan slide, when he’s holding up the three fingers with the trophy,” Berhalter said, “we photoshopped the Nations League trophy into the same picture with Michael Jordan.”

Attacking midfielder Reyna started the game for the US, scored his eighth international goal and later went on to say that winning titles for his country “never gets old”.

“I’ll never take any of them [titles] for granted,” he added.

“The group of guys and the energy we have, I always love coming to camp. I’m at a loss for words right now.”

Son of American football legend Claudio Reyna, the Nottingham Forest player has come a long way fromthe Reyna-Berhalter family feudthat emerged during the team’s run at the 2022 Qatar World Cup.

Berhalter nearly sent Reyna home from the 2022 tournament for a lack of hustle in training, sparking a feud that led the US Soccer Federation appointing interim coaches for much of last year. Berhalter returned in September and Reyna followed suit a month later after recovering from an injury.

“When I took over the team again, I talked about it needing time,” Berhalter said. “And that was something that we both acknowledged. And the more you work together and the more that he believed that intentions were true and that the whole staff has his best interests in mind, I think we started to gain trust.”

Reyna, who was picked as the CONCACAF Nations League player of the tournament, expressed hope that the three-peat would provide inspiration for competing in Copa America on home soil this summer against South America’s top teams.

“It’s big for momentum,” he said. “We’ve been together with our core group now. We know what it takes to win big matches.”

Copa America,Lionel Messi reverses decision to quit Argentina team,"Star striker Lionel Messi will return to play for the Argentine national football team for the “love” of his country, reversing his decision in June to retire from international football.

The Barcelona forward had previously said he wouldnot play for Argentina againfollowing the team’s loss to Chile in the final of the Copa America in the US.









However, in a statement on Friday, Messi explained that he wanted to continue representing his country as he preferred “to help from within”.

“I consider there to be a lot of problems in Argentine football and it’s not my intention to create another one,” the 29-year-old said.

“There are a lot of issues that need to be resolved in Argentine football but I prefer to help from within and not to criticise from the outside. A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting but my love for my country and this shirt is too great.”

The five-time World Player of the Year is now expected to be named in new coach Edgardo Bauza’s squad to face Uruguay and Venezuela for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers to be held in the first week of September.

In addition to the defeat on penalties to Chile, Messi has lost three other major finals with Argentina, two in the past two years including the 2014 World Cup final to Germany in Brazil.

Earlier, Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri had called on Messi to continue playing for the national side.

“It is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours,” Macri had said in June.

Copa America,Uruguay beat Argentina to reach Copa semis,"Uruguay reached the Copa America semi-finals at the expense of hosts Argentina with a 5-4 penalty shootout victory following a 1-1 draw after extra time.

In the other quarter-final on Saturday Peru shocked Colombia 2-0 to reach the last four of Latin America’s most coveted tournament.









Peru, who qualified from the group phase as the best third-placed team, will now meet Uruguay in the semi-finals.

Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera made some big saves during the match but none bigger than when he stopped Carlos Tevez’s effort in the shootout to send the hosts spinning out of the tournament.

Uruguay shocked the home side by taking the lead in the sixth minute from a set piece.

Uruguay star Diego Forlan’s free kick from the left was headed back across goal by defender Martin Caceres and midfielder Diego Perez slid in to score.

But Argentina equalised 11 minutes later when Lionel Messi sent in a curling cross towards the far post where Gonzalo Higuain ghosted in behind the defence to score with a downward header.

Uruguay were reduced to 10 men in the 38th minute when Diego Perez, who had been booked for going in on Javier Mascherano with his studs showing, was shown another yellow card for obstruction.

Argentina captain Mascherano was sent off three minutes from the end of the 90 minutes for a second booking.

Extra time double

For Peru, midfielders Carlos Lobaton and Juan Vargas scored in extra time to set up the semi-final clash with Uruguay.

The Colombians should have taken the lead with a penalty in the 66th minute but striker Radamel Falcao put the ball wide.

With game 0-0 at the end of 90 minutes, Colombia goalkeeper Luis Martinez spilled the ball when he came out at a Vargas free kick and substitute Lobaton fired into the roof of the net to put Peru ahead in the 12th minute of extra time.

Ten minutes later, with Colombia pressing for an equaliser, striker Paolo Guerrero took possession in a counter-attack and passed to man-of-the-match Vargas, who rifled home.

“We have to recognise that if (Colombia) had slotted in the penalty it would have been a different match,” Peru coach Sergio Markarian said at a news conference.

Markarian said that in extra time his team produced their best 30 minutes of the tournament so far.

“We’ve taken a big step, not so much towards the Copa but towards the World Cup. This will unite us,” Markarian said of his first efforts to revive the Peru team after years of disappointment.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2011/7/17/uruguay-beat-argentina-to-reach-copa-semis,POSITIVE,0.987346351146698
Copa America,"Copa America 2021 final: It’s Messi v Neymar, Argentina v Brazil","Europe might be waiting for England versus Italy in Sunday’s Euro 2020 showpiece but there is an even bigger match to look forward to in South America as an older rivalry between two more successful teams kicks off in Saturday’s Copa America final.

Brazil against Argentina is a true clasico.

The teams first met in 1914 and in the years since, they have established themselves as two of the most storied sides in world football.

Together they have won seven World Cups.

The two teams have been head and shoulders above their rivals in this year’s Copa America and in Neymar and Lionel Messi have the tournament’s two standout performers.

Argentina are unbeaten in 19 games going into the showdown at the Maracana stadium, while Brazil, the hosts and reigning champions, have not lost since Argentina beat them in a November 2019 friendly.





This year’s final is especially interesting because of the timing, in terms of organisation and personnel.

The tournament was supposed to be held in Colombia and Argentina but Brazil took over at the last minute due to unrest in Colombia and a COVID-19 surge in Argentina.

It is also another tournament where Argentina – and more notably Messi – are seeking to end a long trophy drought.

They have not won a major title since lifting the Copa America in 1993 and Messi has never won silverware with the national side.

Brazil are narrow favourites and not just because they are at home and have a slightly better record so far in the tournament. They also have a reputation for beating Argentina in crunch games.

The two sides have met four times in finals, three in the Copa America and one in the Confederations Cup – in 2005.

Argentina beat Brazil in the Copa America’s forerunner in 1937 but have not done so in a showpiece match since.

Brazil won in 2004 in the Copa America final in Peru and again in Venezuela in 2007, when they overran a fancied side that contained a young Messi in his first international final.

A major controversy has, meanwhile, taken place ahead of the final.

A famous Brazilian sports journalist, Fabiola Andrade, posted a photo of herself wearing Argentina’s jersey, saying that she would support Argentina instead of Brazil because Messi deserves a title.

This has generated huge discussions involving celebrities, politicians and players, with Neymar using expletives against “whoever cheers against”.

But away from this, the mood in general has been one of disregard towards the tournament.

Brazil has reported more than 19 million cases of coronavirus, including over 531,600 deaths, the second-highest death toll being the US.

On Sunday, up to 7,800 people will be allowed inside the 78,000-capacity Maracana for the final.

This would make it the first match in the 2021 Copa America, South America’s largest international football tournament, with fans in the stands.

Those wishing to attend must arrive with a negative coronavirus test taken no longer than 48 hours earlier. Once inside, they will be required to observe social distancing.

More than 29,000 have died of the coronavirus in Rio alone. The city’s mortality rate from the virus is 432 per 100,000 inhabitants, almost double the 252/100,000 countrywide figure.

“I don’t support hosting the tournament and I never will,” 36-year-old Brazilian Paulo Leierer told Al Jazeera.

“It’s unacceptable [given the COVID situation]. Copa America hasn’t helped take the COVID issues away. What helps to ease the worry is economic stability.

“I love football but haven’t really followed the national team for a while since it was being used for politics by a candidate that attacks democracy, I lost interest.”

That moment when Brazil finally won Olympic gold in front of a delirious crowd at the Maracanã Stadium. Can they win again tonight in the#CopaAmericafinal? 🇧🇷#StrongerTogetherpic.twitter.com/K7BrGWkMXf

— Olympics (@Olympics)July 10, 2021

Strong support for hosting the event came from Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, whose much-criticised handling of the pandemic is the subject of a parliamentary investigation.

The build-up to the final has gained a little more traction and interest.

Match ratings on public TV were very low, not only losing in number of viewers to the Euros but also other regular shows.

“I don’t support the tournament taking place in Brazil because of the health scenario we find ourselves in with the pandemic,” Isabelle Jungton, 28, told Al Jazeera.

“An event this big in Brazil right now makes the situation significantly more chaotic. Football won’t take away the bigger worry that is the pandemic. I support the Brazil team but this really isn’t relevant right now.”

Despite the outcry, not everyone in Brazil is against the tournament taking place.

“I support the tournament. Football was already taking place nationally with very strict health and security protocols, plus the infrastructure in Brazil was ready for the event. This debate whether to host the tournament or not is just political,” Alex Roberto Arno, 56, told Al Jazeera.

“It’s definitely not on the same level as the Euros. The quality also isn’t what you see in the Euros but I’m supporting Brazil and I believe they will win.”

Copa America,Late goal puts Chile into quarter-finals,"



An injury time own-goal from Andre Camillo gave Chile a 1-0 victory over Peru to leave them top of Group C at the Copa America in Argentina.

Chile will now face the second-placed team in Group B, which will be determined on Wednesday when Brazil face Ecuador and Paraguay play Venezuela who are already through as group leaders.









Chile left it until two minutes into second-half stoppage time, when a curling corner taken by Jorge Valdivia rebounded off the knee of Peru substitute Andre Carrillo and into the open goal.

Chile finished Group C on top with seven points and managed to avoid the hosts and tournament favourites Argentina, who topped Group A. Argentina now play Uruguay in the quarter-finals who beat Mexico 1-0 to claim second place in Group C.

“Chile deserved to finish first in the group,” said coach Claudio Borghi who took over from Marcelo Bielsa following the 2010 World Cup.

Chile and Peru had already secured their quarter-final spots before the game and had rested several regular starters for the game at the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas. Peru coach Sergio Markarian made nine changes from the squad that beat Mexico 1-0 in their previous match.

Both teams were reduced to 10 men from the 62nd minute when Chile’s Jean Beausejour and Peru’s Giancarlo Carmona were sent off for an altercation which followed a rough challenge.

Chile controlled much of the game and striker Esteban Pareden came close in the 14th minute but he was just a bit late to try and get on the end of a low cross by Jean Beusejour.In the second half, Paredes went close again for Chile with a header that caught the outside of the net.

The match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw, after Chile’s Humberto Suazo narrowly failed to get on the end of a deflected cross in injury time.

Chile’s winner came from a subsequent corner from Jorge Valdivia. Waldo Ponce was credited with the goal, but replays showed the ball had last touch the knee of Peru’s Andre Carrillo.

The victory means Chile will play their quarter-final at San Juan, near theChilean border.

Old rivalry renewed

Uruguay’s winning goal against Mexico came in the 15th minute as a Diego Forlan free kick was pounced on by Alvaro Pereira.

Uruguay dominated the early play, and Pereira’s goal gave them even more momentum.

Mexico’s keeper Michel was forced to make a diving stop just a minute after the goal, while Uruguay’s DiegoForlan and Luis Suarez could have doubled the lead in the first half. Uruguay pressed for a second goal in the second half, dominating most of the possession.

Uruguay should have scored more, with Forlan missing three or four clear chances. Forlan is now scoreless in his last 10 matches with the national team.

Copa America,Argentina’s Barras Bravas,"The violence that followed River Plate’s relegation from the Argentina’s top football division for the first time in their 110-year history has raised questions over hosting the Copa America final at their ground, the Monumental, on July 24.

Copa America,Lionel Messi hat-trick leads Argentina to 6-0 win over Bolivia,"Lionel Messi has scored his 10th international hat-trick and grabbed two assists as Argentina thrashed Bolivia 6-0 in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup in front of an adoring home crowd at the Monumental Stadium.

Making only his second international appearance since recovering from an injury sustained at the Copa America in July, Messi capitalised on a mistake by defender Marcelo Suarez to open the scoring in the 19th minute on Tuesday.

Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra made a couple of fine saves to prevent the hosts from extending their lead – but he was beaten in the 43rd minute when Lautaro Martinez scored from Messi’s quick cross. Argentina made it 3-0 just before the break, with Messi setting up Julian Alvarez to score.

Lionel Scaloni’s side controlled the second half as well. It looked like they had extended their lead through Nicolas Otamendi, only to see the goal disallowed for offside.

Nahuel Molina’s assist in the 70th minute allowed substitute Thiago Almada to convert another goal, making it 4-0 in favour of the home side.

Messi, 37, gave Argentina fans more reason to celebrate in the closing moments, beating two Bolivia defenders before unleashing a fierce shot past Viscarra to score his second goal of the contest.

Messi needed only two more minutes to complete the hat-trick. The Argentinian skipper scored on a left-footed drive to take his tally to 112 goals for his country. That goal also moved Messi level with Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo as the player with the most hat-tricks in international men’s football.

“It’s really nice to come here, to feel the affection of the people, it moves me how they shout my name,” said Messi, who once again refused to say whether he will play in the next World Cup in 2026.

“This drives me. Enjoying being happy where I am. Despite my age, when I’m here, I feel like a kid because I’m comfortable with this team,” he added.

Argentina lead the South American World Cup qualifying with 22 points after 10 matches, three points clear of second-place Colombia, who beat Chile 4-0 on Tuesday. Uruguay, which earlier had a goalless draw with Ecuador, and Brazil have 16 points each, with the Uruguayans in third place on goal difference.

Copa America,Lionel Messi set to return for MLS club Inter Miami after two months out,"Lionel Messi is set to return to action with his Major League Soccer club, Inter Miami, after spending more than two months out with an ankle injury, Miami coach Gerardo Martino confirms.

Messi has not played since spraining his right ankle in Argentina’s July 14 win against Colombia in the 2024 Copa America final. He last played for Inter Miami on June 1 but will be available for selection against the visiting Philadelphia Union on Saturday, Martino said.

“Yes, he’s fine now,” Martino told reporters on Friday.

“Yesterday, he returned to training. He is contemplated for tomorrow’s game, and after training, we will define the strategy for him, but he is available. We are going to once again have the best player in the world within the team, so we are all happy about that situation.”

Messi sat out Wednesday’s session with a sore throat before participating in the Herons’ session on Thursday.

“Luckily, [the sore throat] lasted just one day. Yesterday, he trained normally. Let’s hope he keeps evolving today,” Martino said. “It’s about taking into consideration all that’s happened to define the strategy.”

Inter Miami are closing in on the Supporters’ Shield and the top playoff seed in the Eastern Conference with 59 points from 27 games.

The 37-year-old forward has recorded 12 goals and 13 assists in just 12 MLS matches this season – the fastest to 25 goal contributions in league history.

He has missed eight MLS games for his club and this month’s World Cup qualifiers for his country.

Copa America,Former Chelsea manager Pochettino named US Soccer men’s national team coach,"Former Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has been named the new coach of the United States (USA) men’s team, US Soccer announced in a statement.

Pochettino, who parted ways with English Premier League side Chelsea in May after one season in charge, will take the reins of the national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by Mexico, Canada and the United States.

The Argentinian, a former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager, said his decision to join US Soccer was not just about football, but about the journey the country was on and he could not pass up the opportunity.

“The energy, the passion, and the hunger to achieve something truly historic here – those are the things that inspired me,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.

“I see a group of players full of talent and potential, and together, we’re going to build something special that the whole nation can be proud of.”

US Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said Pochettino was a “serial winner with a deep passion for developing players”.

“His track record speaks for itself, and I am confident that he is the right choice to harness the immense potential within our talented squad. We are thrilled to have Mauricio on board as we embark on this exciting journey to achieve success on the global stage.”

Introducing…#USMNTHead Coach Mauricio Pochettino 🇺🇸

— U.S. Soccer Men's National Team (@USMNT)September 10, 2024



USA have been without a permanent coach since a humiliating early exit from the Copa America on home soil in July led to the sacking of Gregg Berhalter after his second stint as head coach.

The 51-year-old boss was first appointed in 2018 and led the Americans to the knockout stages of the 2022 World Cup, but just weeks later found himself embroiled in a bitter public row with one of the team’s brightest emerging talents, Gio Reyna.

US Soccer’s search for a new coach began when Berhalter’s contract expired at the end of 2022 and included names such as Canada coach Jesse Marsch, but they ultimately rehired Berhalter in June last year with the full support of the players.

However, it proved unsuccessful as the US failed to progress beyond the group stages of the Copa America after a shock 2-1 defeat to Panama and a crushing 1-0 loss to Uruguay.

Pochettino will take over after Mikey Varas, who has been appointed interim coach, oversaw friendlies against Canada last Saturday and New Zealand on Tuesday.

USA drew 1-1 with New Zealand in Cincinnati after Christian Pulisic’s goal was cancelled out by Ben Waine’s late equaliser.

Copa America,Resurgent Peru down Mexico 1-0,"Peru has defeated Mexico 1-0 at the Copa America football tournament in Argentina to move level on points at the top of Group C with Chile.

In Friday’s first game, Chile came from behind to draw 1-1 with Uruguay.









Paolo Guerrero claimed his second goal of the tournament to give the Peruvians a deserved victory against an under-strength Mexico. He stroked the ball home from close range in the 82nd minute after being left unmarked at the far post.

The win put Peru on four points alongside Chile and leaves World Cup semi-finalists Uruguay third in the group on two points, needing a positive result in their final game next week to advance to the quarter-finals.

Having drawn their opener against Peru, Uruguay went in search of a win against Chile and Luis Suarez should have put them ahead after 19 minutes but blasted over after Edinson Cavani had put him through.

Eight minutes later, a mix-up in the Chilean defence left Diego Forlan with a free header from the edge of the six-yard box with Chilean keeper Claudio Bravo stranded, but defender Pablo Contreras cleared the goal-bound effort off the line.

Chile’s closest first-half effort came from a bizarre deflection.

Uruguayan defender Diego Lugano attempted to boot the ball clear but it hit Chile’s Mauricio Isla and floated over Fernando Muslera towards the Uruguayan goal but came back off the crossbar.

However, nine minutes after the break, Alvaro Pereira broke the deadlock for Uruguay. Suarez was the provider, crossing from the left for the Porto player to stroke home.

Chile went on the attack and in the 65th minute, Jean Beausejour escaped down the left and cut the ball back for Sanchez, who buried a low shot in the far corner of the Uruguayan net to earn his side a point.

“I’m happy with the way the team played,” Chile’s Argentine coach Claudio Borghi said.

“Let’s not forget we were playing against the team that finished fourth at the World Cup and that they had almost the same team as then, and that we were losing, so coming from behind was important.”

Six of the opening 10 matches in South America’s most prestigious international tournament have ended in draws and invitee Costa Rica, supposedly the weakest team in the competition, are the only side to have won by two clear goals.

Hosts Argentina have drawn both their matches and Brazil drew their first.

The top two teams from the three groups advance to the quarter-finals along with the best two third-place finishers.

Copa America,Uruguay and Peru in Copa quarters,"







Peruand Uruguay did just enough to ensure they joined Venezuela in theCopa America quarter-finals leaving Bolivia as the first team to pack their bags for home.

Host nation Venezuela’s goalless draw with Uruguay saw them emerge as Group A winners with their opponents scraping through in third.









Peru came from behind twice to eliminate Bolivia in a 2-2 draw and secure their place in the last eight.

Roared on by 40,000 fans in Merida’s Metropiltan stadium Venezuela dominated possession early on, creating several opportunities.

Coming off their second-ever Copa victory over Peru on Saturday, Venezuela threatened early and almost scored after nine minutes when Giancarlo Moldanado, cut the ball back from the goal line to a charging Juan Arango, who’s shot flew a meter high of the crossbar.

Venezuela already knew of their qualification following the previous nights results from Group C and both teams slowed off in the second-half, presumably conserving energy for battles to come later in the tournament.

One of those battles could be a second meeting between the sides in the quarterfinals depending on which of the third-place spots Uruguay falls into after the remaining group matches.

Venezuela finished Group A on five points, one more than Uruguay.

The two were sandwiched in the group standings by Peru who came from behind twice despite being down to ten men against Bolivia and secured their qualification with five minutes remaining.

Bolivia, who knew they would reach the quarters with a victory, took the lead through Jaime Moreno’s lob from the edge of the area in the 24thminute.

But Peru equalised nine minutes later on a counterattack, when Paolo Guerrero headed a free kick into the ground and inside the left post.

A driving shot by Jhasmany Campos put Bolivia ahead 2-1 in first half injury time and the score remained unchanged until new Chelsea signing Claudio Pizzaro, following the expulsion of substitute Jhoel Herrera in the 78th minute, headed in a Juan Carlos Marino free kick seven minutes later.

Bolivia were consequently eliminated at the group stages for the fourth consecutive time in the South America championship.

However Erwin Sanchez, the Bolivian coach, was quick to salute the efforts of his players.

“With a little extra luck we could’ve qualified,” he said. “But we’re going with our heads held high because nobody was able to crush us, nobody steamrolled past us. It was just this one late goal that eliminated us.”

Copa America,From Alvarez to Olise: Five top footballers to watch at Paris Olympics 2024,"Brazil stormed to a second Olympic gold in football at Tokyo 2020, but it’s another South American nation that is expected to dominate at Paris 2024.

Argentina boasts a wealth of current, future and vastly experienced talent in their squad, which will be managed by their former international midfielder Javier Mascherano.

The Brazilians saw off Spain in the final last time around, with Mexico claiming bronze from the host nation, Japan.

This edition of the men’s football tournament begins on July 24, two days ahead of the official opening of the Olympic Games. Here are our top five players to watch:

The tournament’s star name is undoubtedly Manchester City forward Alvarez.

The 22-year-old was in prolific form last season for Pep Guardiola’s side, who he helped to win an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title.

That all came after the Cityzens lifted five trophies in 2023 – in Alvarez’s first season – by completing the treble of the league, FA Cup and Champions League before claiming the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.

Born in Calchin in Cordoba Province, Alvarez joined City in 2022 from River Plate, where his performances drew the attention of Europe’s elite but also the coach of Argentina’s 2020 Olympic team, who selected him for the Tokyo Games.

Alvarez has just flown into France for the Olympics after winning Argentina the Copa America title on July 14 – he would like nothing more than to add an Olympic gold medal to his long list of achievements.

A big money move from Crystal Palace in the English Premier League to German giants Bayern Munich has put Olise’s name on the global stage.

The 22-year-old forward was born in London, England, where Arsenal first picked up his talents at the age of nine.

Olise then spent the following eight years in the youth ranks of the Gunners, Chelsea and Manchester City before Reading, then in English football’s second tier, offered him his first professional contract.

The failure of the big three to retain Olise became apparent with his 2021 move to Palace, where he became an immediate success and was even seen as the replacement for Wilfried Zaha, when the Ivory Coast international moved to Galatasaray in Turkey for the start of the 2023 season.

The confirmation of his rise to Zaha’s level came with July’s reported $65m move to Bayern.

Olise was born to a Nigerian father and French-Algerian mother, which is where his decision to represent France originates.

The name that may usurp all others at the Olympics could be that of Thiago Almada.

Where expectation will sit upon the shoulders of fellow countryman and Premier League star Alvarez, Almada has a stock that is primed for takeoff.

The 23-year-old has returned to play his club football in the Brazilian top flight with Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas after a shock $21m move from US Major League Soccer (MLS) side Atlanta United.The deal could potentially reach up to $30m in additional payments.

It is widely expected that Almada will join French club Lyon, who have the same ownership as Botafogo, after he made no secret of his desire to switch the Americas for European football.

The attacking midfielder won the MLS Newcomer of the Year award in 2022 following his move from his native Argentina.

That same year, he became the first active MLS player to win the World Cup when Argentina beat France in the final in Qatar.

France had hoped that their squad would be graced by the talismanic Antoine Griezmann to lead the line, but in Crystal Palace’s Jean-Philippe Mateta, they have an able replacement.

With Olise already one of the headline names, the pair will share a link-up from their time together in the Premier League.

Mateta, who joined Palace in 2022 from French club Mainz, has represented France throughout the youth level but has yet to play for the senior side.

The 27-year-old, who also holds DR Congo citizenship, has scored an impressive 22 Premier League goals in 41 starts since his permanent move to Selhurst Park.

One of the most surprising selections among the Olympic teams is World Cup semifinalist Achraf Hakimi.

The defender helped the Atlas Lions make it to the last four at Qatar World Cup 2022, making history as the first African nation to reach the semifinal of the global competition. Morocco’s run also marked the first time they had reached the quarterfinals.

At 25, Hakimi has already enjoyed an illustrious club career, having started in the city of his birth with Real Madrid.

Following two loan spells with Borussia Dortmund in Germany, the fullback moved to Inter Milan in Italy before a 2021 move to France with his current club, Paris Saint-Germain.

Copa America,Neymar injured as Brazil lose to Uruguay; Messi scores two in Argentina win,"Brazil took two serious blows in their World Cup qualifying match against Uruguay, as they lost 2-0 and then saw their star forward Neymar leave the Centenario stadium in Montevideo in tears following an injury to his left knee.

Brazil captain Casemiro said Neymar’s injury on Tuesday seemed “serious” as Brazil put on their worst performance under new coach Fernando Diniz, who will remain in the job at least until next year’s Copa America.

“For Neymar to leave the match it is surely something serious,” Casemiro told reporters after the game.

“But I hope it isn’t at the end. He has had those injuries whenever he starts picking up his pace again, it is hard”

Uruguay, now coached by Argentinian Marcelo Bielsa, had their first win against Brazil in 22 years.

While Brazil were handed their first defeat in 37 World Cup qualifying matches on Tuesday, their South American neighbours Argentina beat Peru 2-0 with Lionel Messi scoring both goals as he played the full match for the world champions.

The 36-year-old appeared fit after he was sidelined for several matches with his club Inter Miami because of muscular pain.

Messi increased his international goal tally to 106 in 178 appearances, moving within two of Iran’s Ali Daei for second on the career list behind Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo at 127.

The defending World Cup champions never faced risks at Lima’s National Stadium against a Peruvian team that have yet to score in four qualifying matches. Argentina’s confident performance could be traced to Messi finally playing as a starter and appearing fully healthy.

He made it 1-0 after a counterattack in the 32nd minute. Enzo Fernandez passed to Nico Gonzalez on the left. A low cross found Messi at the edge of the box, and he shot it to the left angle of goalkeeper Pedro Gallese.

Messi scored again 10 minutes later after Fernandez found him nearly at the same spot. Messi shot it on Gallese’s right corner. He later had a goal disallowed for a low-margin offside caught by video review in the 57th minute.

“Yes, we have a good group and a good environment in our dressing room and things are much easier. We enjoy being together and playing together,” Messi said after the match.

“After we won the World Cup we got confidence, we are more united and firm. I hope we can keep growing.”

Peruvian and Argentinian fans tried to invade the field after the match to hug Messi, who led the World Cup champions to their eighth straight victory since they won last year’s title in Qatar.

Elsewhere, Venezuela beat Chile 3-0, Ecuador and Colombia had a scoreless draw, and Paraguay beat Bolivia 1-0 on Antonio Sanabria’s goal in the 69th minute.

Argentina lead the South American qualifying group with 12 points in four matches. Uruguay, Brazil and Venezuela have seven points and are separated by goal difference. Colombia have six points, and Ecuador, Paraguay and Chile have four each. Peru have one point and Bolivia have zero.

The next World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada will include 48 teams, meaning direct entry for the top six teams in South America. The seventh-place team will contest an intercontinental playoff for a berth.

Copa America,Now or never: Does football owe Messi a World Cup?,"Lionel Messi’s smile was melancholic as he answered the reporter’s question after Argentina’s loss to Chile in the 2016 Copa America final.

“That’s it for me, I’m done with the national team,” said Messi. “Like I said before, we lost four finals and it’s just not for me.”

The anguish was evident on Messi’s face in that interview, where he announced his international retirement in the immediate aftermath of the loss.

When asked if his decision was final, he was non-committal but pointedly added how it just had to be him to miss the decisive first penalty in the shootout.

For a man gifted a left foot that God created on Sunday, someone consecrated by millions across the world, it’s fitting that Messi is a strong believer in the power of destiny.

It’s something he often evokes when talking about Argentina. In the viral dressing room clip of his speech ahead of the 2021 Copa America final, he spoke of how there was no such thing as coincidence that the tournament was shifted from Argentina to Brazil.

“God brought it here for us to lift at the Maracana, boys,” he said passionately.

Qatar 2022 will almost certainly be his closing act on the international stage. It is now or never for Messi but in one sense, so has been each of the last three World Cups.

In 2010, with Diego Maradona as manager, it felt written in the stars for the king and the heir to restore glory to Argentina for the first time since 1986. However, reality, and Germany, came crashing down on romance in South Africa.

The 2014 World Cup in Brazil coincided perfectly with the crest of Messi’s career, when he entered the tournament having won four consecutive Ballon d’Ors in the previous six years.

The supporting cast of Gonzalo Higuain, Angel di Maria, Javier Mascherano and Kun Aguero were arguably at the peak of their powers – the ingredients for success could not have been more ripe. An appearance in the final where they were eventually felled by Germany belied a mediocre showing that saw them score just two goals after the group stages.

“It is now or never for us, there is no more. We have to see this as our final World Cup and look at it as such and take advantage of the opportunity,” Messi said.

It’s a quote that would have applied to Argentina today but in actuality was said ahead of the World Cup in Russia in 2018.

They arrived as one of the oldest teams in the tournament, having secured qualification through the skin of their teeth. Argentina’s campaign was running on fumes from the start and it inevitably imploded in the round-of-16 against France.

Doha felt light years away from Kazan on that afternoon and many, including Messi, expected it to be his final bow.

Qatar is not a now-or-never World Cup for Messi, it’s a postscript for a movie that was supposed to have ended in Russia.

It’s tough to make sense of Messi’s World Cup performances. While there have been moments of genius – the injury-time winner against Iran in Brazil, the assist for Di Maria against Switzerland in the round-of-16, the touch and goal against Nigeria in 2018 – he is yet to score a goal in the knockout stages of the tournament.

For Argentina, he has seldom recreated the levels he consistently hits for his clubs. Close your eyes and think of Messi and the first image that comes up is of him in the blaugrana of Barcelona, hands aloft as the Camp Nou sways to his music.

Argentina has always been second fiddle to Messi’s iconography.

The searing images of Messi in blue and white are predominantly coloured by pain – the forlornness on his face as he posed with the Golden Ball in 2014, the uncontrollable tears in the Metlife arena after the Copa America loss in 2016, the manner in which he ignored Olivier Giroud’s outstretched hand in the tunnel after the loss to France in 2018.

While the Copa America triumph last year was a rare silver lining, it felt seismic not as much for the magnitude of the win as for the context behind it.

But, it isn’t just the lack of on-field success that led to the fraught nature of Messi’s relationship with Argentinian fans.

Jonathan Wilson, author ofAngels with Dirty Faces: The Footballing History of Argentina, believes the roots of this issue can be found in an editorial published in the iconic Argentinian sports magazine El Gráfico in 1928.

“[The writer] says if you were to erect a statue of Argentinian football, it would be the urchin child in the streets, he’d have this massive dark hair, he’d be short and squat. His teeth would be worn down by eating yesterday’s bread, his shirt would be eaten by the mice [and] he’s coming from an impoverished background,” Wilson told Al Jazeera.

“When Maradona arrives it’s like ‘this is the one’ and broadly speaking, he lived up to that with huge lows whereas Messi, it’s a different physical type, he doesn’t fit the template, so I think there’ll always be that resistance in Argentina.”

While Messi’s move to Spain at a young age also added to the resistance he faced in Argentina, Wilson believes the turning point in his relationship with the fans came after his retirement announcement in 2016.

“When he missed the penalty against Chile, he was clearly so devastated. His tears and retirement that shocked people into ‘we need him back’ and there was this outpouring of ‘please don’t retire’,” added Wilson.

Such was the intensity of this sentiment in Argentina that the arrivals board of the subway in Buenos Aires read “No te vayas Lio” (Lio, don’t go).

He didn’t go back then but he will now.

Maybe football does owe Messi a World Cup, in the same way it owes Steven Gerrard a Premier League, Gigi Buffon a Champions League and Franck Ribery a Ballon d’Or.

Greatness is not always perfect and not winning the World Cup will not take away from Messi’s legacy.

But winning it would add so much.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2022/11/13/does-football-owe-lionel-messi-a-world-cup,NEGATIVE,0.7721421122550964

Argentina’s nearly 30 of pain and run of tearful losses in important final matches came to an end last year when they won the Copa America and Lionel Scaloni’s team will head to the World Cup by taking confidence from that triumph in Brazil.

Having last lost at the 2019 Copa America, the Argentinian national team, La Albiceleste, fly into Qatar on the back of a 35-match unbeaten streak and as one of the firm favourite to break Europe’s 16-year stranglehold on the World Cup.

Much of the credit for winning a significant final after six failed attempts goes to Scaloni, the 44-year-old player who rose from the role of assistant to doomed manager Jorge Sampaoli, to caretaker, and eventually permanent boss.

The Argentine Football Association entrusted the rebuilding project to Scaloni who took over after their 2018 World Cup exit in the last 16 and with him at the helm Argentina followed up the 2021 Copa win by comfortably beating Euro winners Italy in June’s ‘Finalissima’.

Argentina had been a top heavy side for years with a luxury of options to choose from in attack but were let down by a defence and midfield that leaked goals. Scaloni’s first order of business was changing that.

Out went ageing players and in came young, hungry hopefuls as Scaloni implemented his vision for a successful team that would later be nicknamed “La Scaloneta” – the house Scaloni built.

Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, centre-back Cristian Romero and midfielder Rodrigo De Paul formed the spine of the new-look team as Scaloni found players capable of taking some of the burden off Lionel Messi’s shoulders.

Their possession-based game, with players such as Giovani Lo Celso, Leandro Paredes and De Paul dictating the tempo, freed Messi to be involved further up the pitch where he is most lethal.

Their talisman has been encouraged by Scaloni’s changes and tactical acumen, growing more determined to perform well for Argentina and even playing through injury in the Copa America semis and final.

“Scaloni is one of us,” Messi said. “It was he who selected the national team, the one who believed, the one who took charge at a difficult moment. He gave us confidence, he was bringing in new people, he always knew what he wanted and we grew. From the Copa America 2019, we took a leap.”

The 35-year-old was the best player at the 2014 World Cup when he came agonisingly close to replicating Diego Maradona’s success by leading Argentina to World Cup glory, only to be beaten in the final by a superior Germany team.

Messi is the sole surviving member from that starting lineup at the Maracana Stadium. But this time he has the support of a squad built by Scaloni to win not just matches, but titles.

Copa America,Brazil fail to live up to expectation,"Venezuelan players issued a get well soon message to ailing president Hugo Chavez after their surprise goalless draw on Sunday with holders Brazil at the Copa America.

Grendy Perozzo and Franklin Lucena sent messages on behalf of the squad to Chavez, who is convalescing in Cuba after undergoing surgery for a cancerous tumour.









“I want to send you all the help possible to a human being who is passing through a difficult moment,” said Perozzo, who said the players had earlier taken heart from a Twitter message sent by the president to wish the team luck.

The Venezuelan team certainly didn’t disappoint their president with an impressive display against a Brazil team fancied my many to win the tournament.

“I want to send you all the help possible to a human being who is passing through a difficult moment”

Message from Venezuelan players to president Hugo Chavez

Brazil were supposed to turn on the style on Sunday and ease past rank outsiders Venezuela in kick-starting a bid for a hoped-for third consecutive Copa America triumph.

Instead, the Venezuelans, straining every sinew for every ball, put the hex on the auriverde at the Estadio Unico in La Plata and secured a second goalless draw with their much-lauded rivals in a row.

Just over a decade ago the five-times world champions slaughtered their counterparts from the Caribbean nation, where baseball remains sport numero uno, 7-0 to get a triumphant Copa campaign under way.

But where Ronaldo, Ronaldino and Rivaldo found rich pickings on that occasion, Brazil this time were left to contemplate only sour grapes as they found this year’s ‘Vinotinto’ made of sterner stuff.

Brazil coach Mario Menezes, in charge for his first tournament after replacing unlamented pragmatist Dunga, had hoped for better things in choosing an attacking line-up.

Hot young talents Neymar and Ganso from Santos, plus comparatively elder statesmen and Milan stars Pato and Robinho were supposed to form the magic quartet to create the kind of sumptuous fare served up for France two decades ago by Michel Platini, Alain Giresse, Luis Fernandez and Jean Tigana.

Back to square one

Those four midfield musketeers were dubbed the “carré magique” or “magic square” and they lit up the 1984 European championship in particular – even if at World Cup level they never quite managed to land the big prize.

But on Sunday’s evidence it’s more back to square one than magic square for the Brazilians.

Brazil fans found little to cheer their chilled bones in close to zero temperatures.

Many could have been forgiven, in their frozen state, for wishing they were instead cheering on the auriverde’s women’s team at the ongoing World Cup in Germany, where Marta produced the kind of finishing earlier in the day against Norway which was sadly not in evidence from the men.

“We played well in the first half and were just missing a goal,” Robinho insisted.

“We created a lot of chances and so that stands us in good stead, even if it is always better to win,” he said.

Robinho did admit, however, that an improvement is clearly needed – and quickly.

“We must correct the things which we did poorly when we meet Paraguay” next Saturday, he said.

More of the same against the tough Paraguayans and thereafter against a hard to break down Ecuador and the holders would be struggling to convince their fans that they still possess, deep down, the magic touch.

Paraguay were impressive during their 0-0 draw against Ecuador on Sunday.

“We played the best 15 minutes so far in this Copa America and it would be unjust not to recognise that,” Paraguay coach Gerardo Martino told reporters after the match in Santa Fe.

“If (Marcelo) Elizaga was chosen as man of the match, there’s a reason,” he said of Ecuador’s goalkeeper, who made a string of fine saves as Paraguay laid siege to his goal in the opening quarter of an hour.

The tournament, played in extremely cold weather, has produced just three goals in four matches after hosts Argentina were held 1-1 by Bolivia and Colombia beat Costa Rica 1-0 in Group A.

Copa America,UEFA Euro 2020: What you need to know,"The UEFA Euro 2020, postponed from last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, kicks off on Friday, with Turkey taking on past winners Italy in Rome.

When the action gets under way at 20:00 GMT in front of a planned 16,000 fans at a quarter-full Stadio Olimpico, the overwhelming feeling for European football’s governing body, UEFA, will be of relief following the unprecedented decision to put the tournament on hold last year.

Portugal, who are grouped with Hungary and past winners France and Germany, are the defending champions, having won the 2016 edition.

The tournament kicks off on Friday, June 11. The knockout phase starts on June 26 with the final taking place on July 11 at London’s Wembley Stadium.

For the first time in the tournament’s history, it will be taking place across the continent with 11 host cities in all: London, Saint Petersburg, Baku, Munich, Rome, Amsterdam, Bucharest, Budapest, Copenhagen, Glasgow and Seville.

A total of 24 teams divided into six groups will be taking part in the tournament, which comprises 51 matches.

Group A: Turkey, Italy, Wales, Switzerland

Group B: Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Russia

Group C: Netherlands, Ukraine, Austria, North Macedonia

Group D: England, Croatia, Scotland, Czech Republic

Group E: Spain, Sweden, Poland, Slovakia

Group F: Hungary, Portugal, France, Germany

The top two teams from each group, plus four best third-place finishers, will progress to the round-of-16 phase which will be followed by the quarterfinals, semifinals and the final.

Yes. Each of the 11 venues has been given clearance to host fans. UEFA confirmed that Saint Petersburg and Baku will have up to 50 capacity; Budapest aims to host a full house; Amsterdam, Bucharest, Copenhagen, Glasgow, Rome and Seville will be hosting 25 to 45 percent; London will have a minimum capacity of 25 percent; Munich aims to host approximately 22 percent of the stadium capacity.

Dublin and Bilbao were dropped from the list of host cities after refusing to give guarantees over spectator numbers, but Seville stepped in for the latter while Dublin’s games went to London and Saint Petersburg.

Copa America,Bolivia prove no walkover,"Argentina escaped a shock upset in their Copa America opener on Friday when substitute Sergio Aguero’s late volley earned the hosts a 1-1 draw with Bolivia.

Bolivia soaked up the pressure in the first half before snatching the lead early in the second through Edivaldo Rojas.









The hosts had to wait until the 77th minute for the equaliser when Aguero slammed the ball home.

Argentina’s Lionel Messi was marked tightly by the Bolivian defence and had few chances to shine.

“It is not what we expected, now we must improve and we win our remaining (group) matches,” a visibly disappointed Messi told reporters.

“Now we need tranquility.”

One way pressure

Having weathered a first-half storm at the Ciudad de La Plata stadium, Bolivia stunned Argentina two minutes into the second half when Jhasmany Campos hit a corner low to the near post where Rojas back-heeled it past goalkeeper Sergio Romero.

Marcelo Martins looked set to give Bolivia a two-goal lead on the hour when he beat Argentina’s offside trap but Romero dived to touch the ball away from the striker’s feet then got up to block his second effort.

Argentina equalised with 13 minutes left when Nicolas Burdisso chested down a cross from Marcos Rojo and Aguero volleyed home. Minutes after his goal, Aguero might have snatched a win for the hosts but his shot brought a diving save from Bolivia goalie Carlos Arias.

In an exciting finish, either side could have snatched victory as Argentina created chances while Bolivia attempted to hit them on the break.

“We had a couple of situations that if we’d put them away we could have won the match,” Bolivia’s Argentine-born coach Gustavo Quinteros said.

“I think the team settled and were more solid in the final minutes of the first half and almost all of the second,” he told news conference.

When Spain meet England in the final of Euro 2024, history will beckon for either winner.

The Spanish will become the outright record winners of the competition, moving clear of Germany, if they lift the trophy for the fourth time, while the English will be crowned continental champions for the first time if they come out on top.

Spain have enjoyed a remarkable run to the final, having already created history with a 100 percent record from their six games, and are clear favourites in the run-up to the match. England, in contrast, have stuttered, spluttered and dragged themselves from the brink of elimination to reach the showpiece in the German capital, Berlin.

With victories in 1964, 2008 and 2012 already behind them – along with a 2010 World Cup win – the Spanish can enter the match without fear of failure, while boasting a form book that is fluttering freely. They swept through their group without conceding a goal and have rarely looked challenged in the knockout stages despite being pitted against the host nation, Germany and the pretournament favourites, France.

Only Georgia caused a momentary hint of an upset for Spanish fans, when they had the audacity to take the lead in the round-of-16 encounter – Spain swept to a 4-1 win and it could have been double that in the end.

Among those to shine against the Georgians was Lamine Yamal, now a household name the world over. The Barcelona winger could have had a hat-trick in that match but saved his first tournament goal to level the semifinal against the French, which wrote him into the history books as the youngest goalscorer at a European Championship. Saturday marked his 17th birthday.

After a limp display of one win and two draws in their group, England were seconds away from elimination in the round of 16 against Slovenia before Jude Bellingham’s last-gasp overhead kick took the tie to extra time. Harry Kane settled matters without the need for penalties.

Gareth Southgate’s side were pushed all the way to spot kicks by Switzerland, when Bukayo Saka was among the heroes and banished the memories of his miss in the Euro 2020 final defeat by Italy.

That is the closest England have previously come to a Euro crown, but they have had their moments, including on home soil in 1996 when they agonisingly lost their semifinal on penalties to Germany having been the better side in open play.

On their way to the last four in that edition, they beat Spain on penalties following a goalless draw in the quarterfinals. They also produced one of their most memorable performances since winning the 1966 World Cup – their only major international trophy – when they beat Netherlands 4-1 in the group stage.

It was against the Dutch, in the semifinals, that they produced their most stirring performance at this edition. The first-half display was comprehensive, while Netherlands produced a more obdurate response in the second period. That nearly wore down Southgate’s team but, with extra-time looming, Ollie Watkins came off the bench to score a deserved injury-time winner.

There is little to no doubt that England possess the potential as a team to overcome Spain in the final but that is based on the quality of the individuals at Southgate’s disposal.

Should the England manager get a song out of his stars then football may well be “coming home” and 58 years of hurt will come to an end with only a second piece of international silverware for the nation heralded with the greatest domestic league in the world.

Spain are the first team to win six consecutive times at the European Football Championship games. Will it be a magnificent seven for the Spaniards or will England burst the Spanish pinata?

Spain welcome back Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand from suspension. Both full-backs started the quarterfinal victory against Germany with the former sent off in extra-time for a cynical second bookable offence in the sixth minute of additional time in extra-time. The latter picked up a 29th-minute yellow card before being withdrawn at the interval. The Spaniards have no new injury concerns otherwise, so are unlikely to make many more changes as they seek a seventh straight win at the tournament.

England captain Harry Kane was substituted in the semifinal victory against Netherlands due to fatigue, having also limped out of the quarterfinal win against Switzerland. A tumble into the water bottles in the technical area during the last-eight encounter caused both Kane’s calves to cramp, leading to his withdrawal. Following the last-four win against the Dutch, the Bayern Munich striker declared that he would be fit and ready to go in the final.

Luke Shaw has made his first two appearances of the tournament from the bench as he continues his recovery from injury, but Southgate may be inclined to opt for the Manchester United defender’s experience from the start for the final.

The expanded 32-team tournament, which will feature leading clubs from around the world, will be held around the United States from June 15 to July 13.

A total of 12 venues will be used for the tournament with only two of them on the West Coast – the Rose Bowl in Pasadena near Los Angeles and Lumen Field in Seattle.

The tournament is taking place at the same time as the regional CONCACAF Gold Cup which will be held mainly on the West Coast.

The open-air stadium for the final, which opened in 2010 and has a capacity of 82,500, held the Copa America Centenario final in 2016 when Chile denied Lionel Messi’s Argentina for a second time in a penalty shootout. It will also host the FIFA World Cup 2026  final.

The other venues which will host games are – Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta), Bank of America Stadium (Charlotte), TQL Stadium (Cincinnati), Hard Rock Stadium (Miami), GEODIS Park (Nashville), Camping World Stadium (Orlando), Inter&Co Stadium (Orlando), Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) and Audi Field (Washington, DC).

The Club World Cup will feature title-winning teams from each of FIFA’s continental confederations.

The draw for the tournament will be held in December, with 30 of the 32 places already secured through the qualification procedure.

Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich are among the 12 European teams who have qualified for the tournament while Argentina’s River Plate and Boca Juniors and Brazil’s Flamengo are among six South American teams.

“This new FIFA competition is the only true example in worldwide club football of real solidarity and inclusivity, allowing the best clubs from Africa, Asia, Central and North America and Oceania to play the powerhouses of Europe and South America in an incredible new World Cup which will impact enormously the growth of club football and talent globally,” Infantino said.

The tournament will be viewed as a key test ahead of the World Cup 2026 and there will be a focus on security issues after crowd problems at July’s Copa America games at the stadiums in Charlotte and Miami.

FIFA has yet to announce any broadcast deals or sponsorship contracts for the tournament and the competition has faced some opposition within the game.

FIFPRO and the European Leagues body filed a joint complaint to the European Commission against FIFA over the introduction of the tournament into the international match calendar.

Opponents of the new tournament have said it adds further congestion to an already crowded schedule and increases the workload of players.

The last version of the Club World Cup featured seven teams in a knockout format and was won by Manchester City who beat Brazil’s Fluminense in the final in Saudi Arabia.

This matched their biggest ever margin of defeat in any competition, equaling a 6-0 loss to Uruguay in 1920 in the South American championship, the predecessor of the Copa America.

“We wanted to make the people happy … unfortunately we couldn’t,” Brazil defender David Luiz said. “We apologise to all Brazilians.”

It is also Brazil’s first loss in a competitive match on home soil since 1975, when Peru won 3-1 at the very same Mineirao Stadium in the Copa America. Its last loss at home came in a friendly with Paraguay in 2002.

“We did what we thought was best,” said Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. “Please excuse us for this mistake. I’m sorry we could not get to the final.”

Brazil’s attack was weakened by the loss of Neymar, who fractured a vertebra after getting kneed in the back in the quarter-final win over Colombia. But it was Brazil’s porous defence that was the biggest problem in the first half as the host also sorely missed suspended captain Thiago Silva.

Brazil attacked from the start but they failed to get any solid chances, and it was not long before the Germans opened up the defense and started the rout.



Toni Kroos and Andre Schuerrle scored two goals each, while Thomas Mueller and Sami Khedira added the others. Oscar pulled a late goal back for Brazil.

“The space we had was bigger than against defensive teams,” Mueller said.

“Now we have to pull it off one more time and lift the thing. We should keep our feet on the ground.”

It was Germany’s biggest World Cup win since routing Saudi Arabia 8-0 in a group match in 2002.

Klose scored his record goal in the 23rd minute, pushing him past Brazil striker Ronaldo’s 15 career World Cup goals. The German had his original shot saved, but he followed up as Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar spilled the ball, easily scoring from the rebound.

Kroos scored his first goal in the 25th minute, knocking in a cross from Philipp Lahm that bypassed Mueller in the middle. He made it 4-0 a minute later, beating Cesar after a defensive mistake from Fernandinho left the ball on the feet of Khedira.

Mueller scored the first goal, one-timing a corner from Kroos past Cesar in the 11th minute. Khedira made it 5-0 in the 29th, taking a pass from Mesut Ozil and again beating Cesar.

Schuerrle, who came on for Klose in the 58th minute, scored from a cross by Lahm in the 69th minute, and then knocked a shot off the underside of the crossbar and into the net in the 79th minute.

Copa America,Making sense of Chile’s foul football,"Chile has entered the final of the Copa America regional football championship, one of the world’s most watched sporting events, after defeating Peru in the semi-finals.

Chileans have become famous for being among the world’s most fanatic fans: they don’t just sing their National Anthem before a game: they roar it out, as though their hearts are bursting with patriotism.









But one thing many may not be so proud of, is the latest football scandal to have made world headlines. It has nothing to do with FIFA, but rather with one of their top player’s finger.

Defender Gonzalo Jara has been suspended for “unsporting behaviour”, for sticking a finger up an opponent’s backside during last week’s quarter final against Uruguay. The provocation enraged his Uruguayan opponent, who was expelled from the pitch, allowing Chile to win 1-0 more easily.

The gesture had only taken a split second. The referee didn’t see “the finger of God”, as it has been jokingly dubbed, but the almighty television cameras did.

And speaking of Uruguayan players, can anyone forget Luis Suarez’s memorable teeth, which he used to take a bite out of his Italian opponent during last year’s World Cup? It is still remembered in Suarez bottle openers.

Cameras and lip readers

But jokes aside, these incidents are not as rare as they seem. They are only more noticeable than they were in the past, when there were not hundreds of cameras simultaneously shooting every angle of every move on the pitch.









Cameras and lip readers also capture what the players are saying, which is why these days you usually see Argentina’s Lionel Messi covering his mouth when he speaks to a teammate during a game. No wonder the referee often sees much less of what is happening than the viewer at home.

The Chilean finger incident has prompted many players to explain what the general public perhaps does not know. And that is that foul language and foul gestures are and have always been a part of the game.

Questioning the virtue of an opponent’s mother or sister is a favorite tactic. The idea is to provoke your rival to the point where he loses concentration or goes into a rage that ultimately leads to a sanction.

Even Edison Cavani, the Uruguayan player who was the victim of Jara’s gesture, admits that “these are things that happen in football”.

Maybe so, but it’s a tradition that may not be able to survive the scrutiny of so many high definition cameras, glued to the player’s every word and every move.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/6/30/making-sense-of-chiles-foul-football,NEGATIVE,0.866584062576294
Copa America,The heat is on Argentina,"Like many words in Argentine slang, quilombo has its origins in something sinister which has since evolved into an habitual word used to describe a messy situation, like the country’s attempts to qualify for the quarter-finals of the 2011 Copa America.

Watching Sergio Batista’s team fumble their way to two opening draws against Bolivia and Colombia nestled among a group of cynical Porteños (natives of Buenos Aires) was an intimate lesson in Lunfardo, the slang which evolved from two centuries of nefarious criminal underground networks in the Argentine capital from the 19th and 20th centuries.









Almost every other word was an untranslatable curse, accompanied by ferocious hand gestures, the most incendiary reserved for Batista whenever his quizzical face appeared from the touchlines.

How could Argentina’s manager, blessed with the best player on the planet, make such a quilombo of the group stages in a tournament on home soil?

The situation was temporarily ameliorated after securing their place in the quarter-finals courtesy of a 3-0 victory over Costa Rica on Monday, but the scenario wasn’t quite how most observers envisaged – Argentina qualified in second place in Group A behind Colombia, setting up a precarious last-eight encounter against Uruguay in Sante Fe on Saturday.

Their neighbours from across the Rio Plata have only beaten them once since 1989, a record which stretches back to 13 internationals.

But like the country’s soaring inflation rate, the cynicism of most Argentine football fans also shows no signs of abating.

Centre piece

At the centre of the quilombo is Lionel Messi, the most gifted individual kicking a football on the planet, and his team of cracks who cannot find the right equation for the sum of their individual parts.

Batista’s attempts to mimic Barcelona’s tactics and build a team around the waspish number 10 failed spectacularly against Bolivia and Colombia, a 4-3-3 with Messi at the head completely lost in the abyss alongside Carlos Tevez and Ezequiel Lavezzi.

Only a spectacular volley from substitute Sergio Aguero spared the hosts’ blushes in La Plata against Bolivia, yet Batista stubbornly adopted the same tactics against Colombia five days later, much to the chagrin of the disgruntled press and public.

“To try and imitate Barcelona is a high-risk bet,” said Alfio Basile, who guided Argentina to two Copa America victories in 1991 and 1993.

“They recover the ball when they lose it and for this reason they always have it. It’s impossible to play like them.

“Messi is missing company. If he doesn’t get the ball, it drives him crazy and there goes the game. There is no-one he can play off.”

A third attempt at the same tactics would have been tantamount to football suicide so, with little option, Bastita removed Inter Milan’s Estaban Cambiasso, Napoli’s Lavezzi, Valencia’s Ever Banega and the homesick Carlos Tevez in favour of Madrid-based quartet Fernando Gago, Gonzalo Higuain, Angel Di Maria and Kun Aguero for the must-win encounter against Costa Rica.

Three of the four played alongside Messi in Argentina’s gold medal-winning team from the 2008 Olympics, as well as goalkeeper Sergio Romero, right-back Pablo Zabaleta and midfielder Javier Mascherano.

The results were revelatory.

Playing his favourite role from deep, behind Aguero, Di Maria and lone frontman Higuain, Messi enthralled the crowd at Cordoba’s Mario Kempes Stadium, where one set of fans unravelled a banner which simply read “Messi we believe in you”, with two delightful assists for Aguero and Di Maria.

Playful side

Batista would be churlish to tinker with his 4-2-3-1 formation against Uruguay at the Brigadier General Estanislao Lopez Stadium in Sante Fe, a sentiment echoed by the sceptical press still not entirely convinced by one impressive performance in Cordoba.

But the media also have a sense of humour too – a photo of a distressed Neymar crunched by two defenders was accompanied by the headline “Also suffering” in Sunday’s La Nacion following Brazil’s 2-2 draw with Paraguay, their second draw of the tournament after a deflating 0-0 opening display against Venezuela. A 4-2 victory over Ecuador ensured Brazil went through to the quarter-finals but Mano Menezes’s team have failed to live up to their reputation.

As well as revelling in the schadenfreude of their celebrated neighbour’s plight, Argentines have been tickled by a Youtube clip of a dumbfounded River Plate fan screaming obscenities at his television screen watching his team relegated on the final day of the season last month.

Tano Pasman was blissfully unaware his rant, loaded with vengeful and explicit Lunfardo, was being recorded and has since become a viral sensation around the country and the world.

Anything less than a victory on Saturday and Pasman’s scene would be replicated up and down the country.

That’s one quilombo Batista does not want on his hands.

Copa America,PSG’s Lionel Messi wins record seventh Ballon d’Or,"Argentine forward Lionel Messi has claimed his seventh Ballon d’Or, edging out Polish striker Robert Lewandowski and Italian midfielder Jorginho for the top honour.

Messi,who movedfrom Barcelona to Paris St Germain over the summer, retained the prestigious award on Monday, breaking his own record set in 2019 when he won the Ballon d’Or for the sixth time.

The Ballon d’Or was not awarded last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Messi won his first major international tournament with Argentina in July, helping the country’s national teambeat Brazilto lift the Copa America trophy.

“It’s incredible to be here again. Two years ago I thought it was the last time. Winning the Copa America was key,” Messi, 34, said after receiving the award in Paris.

— Paris Saint-Germain (@PSG_English)November 29, 2021



“Winning the prestigious award for a record seventh time, the Paris Saint-Germain striker is continuing to make history,” the French football club said on Twitter of Messi’s victory.

Portugal’s Christiano Ronaldo came in sixth in the 2021 Ballon d’Or ranking.

On the the women’s side, Alexia Putellas won the Ballon d’Or award for the first time after an outstanding season with Barcelona and Spain.

She follows in the footsteps of Ada Hegerberg, who won the inaugural women’s Ballon d’Or in 2018, and United States World Cup star Megan Rapinoe, winner in 2019.

“I’m very emotional, it’s a very special moment,” Putellas said at the Paris ceremony through a translator. “I would like to start by thanking all my teammates, especially my current (Barcelona) teammates. For me, it’s a collective success.”

The award for Putellas is the first time that France Football has ever given the honour to a member of the Barcelona women’s team, FC Barca said in astatement.

“Now a club icon and an example for women players in the country, she has the third highest number of appearances for the team (364) and the second biggest all-time goal tally (157),” the club said.

Putellas helped Barca win the treble and scored 26 goals in 42 games overall. She netted in the Champions League final against Chelsea in Gothenburg.

Copa America,Argentina beaten 2-1 by Morocco in chaotic opening game at Paris 2024,"A fan invasion in the opening match of the Olympic football tournament between Argentina and Morocco on Wednesday caused chaos, with Argentina eventually beaten 2-1 following a VAR review after play was suspended with the score tied at 2-2.

Argentina’s Cristian Medina scored deep in injury time to salvagewhat looked like a 2-2 draw, but the decision ruling out the goal was delivered about two hours after play was suspended when the teams re-emerged on to the pitch to finish the match in an empty stadium.

The teams played for three minutes and 15 seconds after VAR completed its review and disallowed the goal.

After order was restored in Saint-Etienne and the teams had left the field following the fan invasion, they discovered that the match had not been completed but suspended by officials.

The venue manager told Reuters the game had been interrupted, adding that a decision about whether the match would be completed was being discussed.

The teams re-emerged just before 7pm local time (17:00 GMT) and warmed up a second time so the final minutes could be played.

The gold medal winners in 2004 and 2008 were not at their best despite lining up with recent Copa America winners Julian Alvarez, Nicolas Otamendi and Geronimo Rulli.

Soufiane Rahimi put Morocco ahead after Achraf Hakimi set him up from the right following a superb passing move in the final seconds of the first half.

Rahimi doubled the advantage and netted his second goal from the penalty spot in the 49th minute before Giuliano Simeone pulled one back for Javier Mascherano’s side in the 68th.

Medina then found the net 16 minutes into stoppage time before fans stormed the pitch and objects were thrown at players as chaos erupted in the eastern French city.

Spain beat Uzbekistan 2-1 in their opening match of Group C at the Parc des Princes.

Spain, who struggled to hit their stride in the opening stages of the game, took the lead in the 29th minute against Uzbekistan with a close-range finish from Marc Pubill off Abel Ruiz’s flick.

Uzbekistan, cheered on by an ecstatic crowd, equalised just before halftime thanks to Eldor Shomurodov’s penalty following a VAR review for a Pau Cubarsi foul.

“For me, Uzbekistan were no surprise,” Spain coach Santi Denia said. “We have achieved our objective, but it’s been a very difficult game and now it is time to improve. That’s my job. I have to transmit better.”

“I told the team at halftime to improve ball circulation, which was what we were missing. We have to improve that. If we do it, we will have more options to achieve victory.”

Football federations from the two nations announced the joint bid on Friday, competing with bids from other potential hosts such as Brazil and a trio of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

“This is a pivotal time for women’s soccer,” said US Soccer President Parlow Cone. “The US and Mexico are in a unique position to host a World Cup that will leverage the same venues, infrastructure, and protocols used for the Men’s World Cup just a year prior.

“This will not only unlock the economic potential of women’s soccer, it will send a message to young players around the world that there is no limit to what they can achieve.”

The competition to host the 2027 Women’s World Cup follows a2023 tournamentthat underscored both the rising popularity and remaining barriers facing women’s football.

Spain securedthe victoryin that competition, hosted by Australia and New Zealand and seen as an unprecedented success.

But a bright moment for women’s football was quickly soured after Luis Rubiales, the former head of Spain’s football association,forcibly kissedSpanish forward Jenni Hermoso while the team celebrated its victory.

The incident set off a wave of anger and FIFA announced a three-year ban for Rubiales in October.

The US is playing host to both the 2024 CONMEBOL Copa America and the 2026 Men’s World Cup, which it will host along with Mexico and Canada.

The trio of Western European nations put in their bid to host the 2027 tournament earlier on Friday, and Brazil submitted its own bid last month.









“Extensive and detailed consultations between the three federations along with key stakeholders including central governments dates back to 2021,” the Dutch football federation (KNVB) said in a statement accompanying the European nations’ bid.

“This has led to alignment around the belief that our three countries are well placed to stage a FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 of unparalleled quality and impact.”

Copa America,World Cup winning coach Lionel Scaloni ponders Argentina future,"Argentina coach Lionel Scalonihas put into question his future at the national team in the middle of their qualification campaign for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

A Copa America title, a World Cup trophy and now a first-of-a-kind win in Brazil has left Scaloni wondering whether he’ll stay on.

Scaloni took the job after the 2018 World Cup, in which Argentina were eliminated in the last 16. Last year, Scaloni and his star captain, Lionel Messi,led the national team to their first World Cup titlesince 1986. His contract with the team runs until after the 2026 World Cup.

“I need to think a lot about what I will do,” Scaloni said at a news conference after Argentina’s 1-0 win over Brazil in a World Cup qualifying match on Tuesday.

“I need this time to think,” Scaloni said after the game in Rio de Janeiro, which was overshadowed by violence in the stands.

The kickoff was delayed by half an hour when Argentina fans and police clashed. The eventual result was Brazil’s first-ever home defeat in a World Cup qualifier.

Scaloni said he’d give it some thought before talking to Argentine Football Association President Claudio Tapia and the players “because this national team needs a coach that has every possible energy and that feels well”.

“It is not a goodbye. It is not something else. But I need to think because the bar is set really high and it is tough to go ahead,” Scaloni said. “It is tough to continue winning.”

He did not respond to other questions after making his comments.

The 45-year-old Scaloni, who had his contract extended after the 2022 World Cup triumph, replaced Jorge Sampaoli as coach.

Before he attended the news conference on Tuesday, Scaloni was seen giving emotional hugs and kisses to other members of the Argentina staff. It was the team’s last match of 2023.

Argentina lead the 10-team South American qualifying competition with 15 points from six matches, followed by Uruguay on 13 and Colombia on 12. Brazil could end the year in sixth position with seven points.

Copa America,Messi bags fifth Ballon d’Or award,"Argentina and Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi was named world player of the year 2015 at a FIFA gala in Zurich and claimed the Ballon d’Or trophy for the fifth time overall.

Messi reclaimed the award after watching his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo walk off with the prize for the previous two years.









The Argentine, who finished ahead of Ronaldo and Brazil forward Neymar, had previously won it four years in a row from 2009 to 2012.

Messi helped Barcelona to win a Spanish league title, cup and Champions League treble plus the Club World Cup and also led Argentina to the Copa America final, where they lost to Chile on penalties.

“It’s incredible, much more than anything I dreamed of as a kid,” said Messi as he received the award.

“I want to thank my team mates. Without them none of this would have been possible.”

Barcelona’s Luis Enrique was voted coach of the year.

US World Cup winner Carli Lloyd, who scored a hat-trick in the final against Japan, was named women’s player of the year.

Ronaldo ended last season without a trophy with Real Madrid, although he helped Portugal to qualify for Euro 2016.

Neymar won a treble alongside Messi at Barcelona but had a less happy time with Brazil, receiving a four-match international ban after he was sent off during the Copa America.

Copa America,Brazil-Argentina World Cup qualifier halted over COVID protocols,"Brazil’s World Cup qualifying clash against Argentina was dramatically suspended shortly after kick-off on Sunday as controversy over COVID-19 protocols erupted.

Amid incredible scenes at Sao Paulo’s Neo Quimica Arena, the match between the two giants of South American football came to a halt when a group of Brazilian public health officials came onto the pitch, triggering a melee involving team staff and players.

Argentina’s players trudged off the pitch to the changing room as the furore erupted. Argentina captain Lionel Messi later re-emerged from the tunnel without his team shirt on as confusion swept around the stadium.

The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said in a statement that the game had been “suspended” but did not say whether the match would resume or be replayed.

“By decision of the match referee, the match organized by FIFA between Brazil and Argentina for the qualifiers for the the World Cup is suspended,” it said.

“The referee and the match commissioner will submit a report to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, which will determine the steps to follow. These procedures adhere strictly to current regulations.”

The stunning intervention came just hours after Brazil’s health authorities said four players in Argentina’s squad based in England should be placed in “immediate quarantine” for breaching COVID-19 protocols.

According to Brazil’s National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), Premier League players Giovani Lo Celso, Emiliano Martinez, Emiliano Buendia and Cristian Romero provided “false information” upon their entry to Brazil.

Romero, Lo Celso and Martinez were all in the Argentina starting lineup that kicked off Sunday’s game – triggering the intervention onto the field of officials wearing ANVISA shirts.

The four Premier League players – Lo Celso and Romero play for Tottenham, while Martinez and Buendia play for Aston Villa – were accused of failing to disclose that they had spent time in the United Kingdom in the 14 days prior to their arrival.

“We got to this point because everything that ANVISA directed, from the first moment, was not fulfilled,” ANVISA Director Antonio Barra Torres said on Brazilian television.

“(The four players) were directed to remain isolated while awaiting deportation, but they did not comply. They went to the stadium and they entered the field, in a series of breaches,” the official added.

A government order dating from June 23 bans the entry into Brazilian territory of any foreign person from the United Kingdom, India or South Africa, to prevent the spread of variants of the coronavirus.

“ANVISA considers that this situation represents a serious health risk and recommends that the local health authorities (of Sao Paulo) order the immediate quarantine of the players, who are prohibited from taking part in any activity and from remaining on Brazilian territory,” the agency said in a statement earlier on Sunday.

ANVISA said Brazil’s federal police had been notified so that “the necessary measures are taken immediately”.

Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni lashed out at Brazilian authorities following the game’s suspension.

“It makes me very sad – we are the victims in the sense that we wanted to play the game, the Brazilian players also wanted to play it and the show was to be played,” Scaloni told Argentina’s TyCSports channel.

Scaloni said the match “should have been a party for everyone, to enjoy the match with the best in the world”.

Copa America,‘Brand Brazil’ suffering from failure,"A year ago, Brazil suffered their most painful and humiliating defeat in the history of football.

Somehow, things have got worse to the extent that remarkably we have to ask ourselves if there is a way back for Brazil. Can the nation synonymous with football ever regain its special status?









I was in Brazil for the astonishing 7-1 beating at the hands of Germany and still not sure it has sunk in for any of us.

The most successful football nation, virtually a brand (comparable to the All Blacks in rugby), taken apart by the Germans like a school playground game. That too at their own World Cup.

We know they weren’t particularly good. But that bad? Shocking, and perhaps irreparable psychologically.So what has happened since, with no major qualifiers to deal with, and the return of the pragmatic Dunga in charge of the giant ego of Scolari?

Interactive: Brazuca – Story of the football

Not only have Brazil been insipid in many of their friendlies – and new stars been thin on the ground – but they managed something extraordinary: To be worse in Copa America than they were at the World Cup.

At times Brazil were close to unwatchable in the South American continental tournament. In the group stage – with Neymar – there was some kind of hope. I find him paradoxically a superstar who is overrated, due to Brazil’s overall failings and Messi being his club teammate.

Without him – stupidly suspended for indiscipline – Brazil were awful. They deserved nothing against Paraguay in the quarter-finals in Chile and that’s exactly what they got. In a way, victory in the shootout would have papered over cracks that urgently need consideration.









Though maybe there is too much for Brazilians, who can talk football day and night, to address. Because the problems on the field are matches by huge issues off it.

It’s tough for Brazilians to look back at the World Cup fondly.

Only success on the pitch could make up for the financial outlay. And though the protests of two years ago seem a distant memory, they have white elephants to remind them.

None with a bigger and whiter trunk than the stadium in Manaus. In a land where political statements so often usurp common sense, building a stadium in a rainforest was a monument to misguided aims. No team plays there. No team was ever going to play there. It’s actually tragic that the project wasn’t halted before it was too late.

There have been a few high profile matches played in Manaus. Nut its cosmetic. Can Brazil really afford to maintain a stadium like this with no team calling it home? Other World Cup stadiums have problems too.

Brasilia’s Garrincha stadium has been hosting the occasional low profile friendly match (not the national team) while costing the city hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain.

Club football mess

Brazilian club football is in turmoil too. Financially even the biggest clubs – Santos included – have struggle to make ends meet. Many have tax issues. They’d like more people paying to watch but the famed Brazilian mark of quality isn’t there. This was underlined by embarrassment against Argentine clubs in the Copa Libertadores.

Such problems are not disconnected with the running of the game in Brazil, where corruption appears to have lurked for decades. In domestic administration and in the FIFA scandals. The reputations of long serving FIFA president Joao Havelange and his son-in-law, former World Cup chief Ricardo Teixeira, have been battered by years of allegations and accusations.

An interesting time for Liverpool to have bought Brazil’s bright new talent to play alongside his international partner.

Roberto Firmino, costing over $40m to link up with Philippe Coutinho. It may turn out to be an inspired move, but you can’t help sensing the whiff of desperation. A Chilean and the Uruguayan (Sanchez and Suarez) are the proven ones. Since when did clubs buy a Brazilian hoping they could emulate other South Americans?

This is how the Brazilian status is slipping. In the brilliant book by Alex Bellos Futebol, the Brazilian way of Life, there is a wonderful opening chapter about an unscrupulous agent managing to sell three terrible

Brazilians footballers to a club in the Faroe Islands on nationality alone.

One of them did forge a new life there but not as a footballer.

These days Brazil may still be a brand but it is not the brand? It appears South America has become more of the brand on the whole. It’s the continent the all-powerful English Premier League seems most interested in mining for high quality players.

What a comedown for the nation of a record five world cups. The glorious golden shirts and the glorious fans. Pele, Garrincha, Zico, Socrates, Ronaldo. It seemed like Brazil would always be a football superpower.

There is too much history, too many footballers, for Brazil to slide too much further. But fully regaining their aura?

Maybe too much damage has been done, not least in that fateful semi-final in Belo Horizonte a year ago.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2015/7/5/brand-brazil-suffering-from-failure,NEGATIVE,0.9576613903045654
Copa America,The gradual fall of Bauza and the Uruguay FA,"Uruguayan football is no stranger toBarra bravaviolence.

It has been a problem for years now and Nacional’s Copa Libertadores match against Newell’s Old Boys was the immediate catalyst to what ended up developing – the Uruguay FA’s resignation.









Several police officers were injured after fans of both sides were involved in massive rumble that spread throughout the stadium and onto the streets. The incidents led to the Uruguayan government having to intervene and deny security at the Gran Parque Central and the Estadio Centenario.

After speculation of FIFA possibly removing Uruguay from the World Cup due to government interference, Sepp Blatter calmed the nerves and confirmed that no such move would take place and that Uruguay’s place was safe.

Bauza’s farewell

Earlier, Sebastian Bauza – Uruguay FA president – had said goodbye to workers and local mediafollowing his resignation. He left the FA along with four of the five board members and members of various committees that resigned en masse, leading to 72 hours of chaos.

It marked the end of an era with an 82% approval rating, according to a survey done by Uruguayan daily El País. The era was marked with successes like the 2010 World Cup performance and winning the Copa América in 2011. Under Bauzá, Uruguay qualified to consecutive World Cups for the first time since 1986.

There was also unprecedented success at youth level – Uruguay played in the 2011 U17 World Cup and at the U20 last year.

Bauzá established a positive working relationship with national team coach Oscar Washington Tabárez as well as with all the national team players, on the squad; something that was not instilled by any president or board member prior to him.

Fan violence

Currently, there is no set legislation in Uruguayan football on fan behaviour. Last month, Bauzá attempted to make one final push for the establishment of the penal code, calling for an extraordinary meeting. This was an urgent matter because FIFA handed down a mandate for a penal code in the league three years ago.

Pedro Damiani and Eduardo Ache, presidents of Peñarol and Nacional respectively, were the only presidents not present. This was a fatal blow for Bauzá as their refusal to appear symbolised their lack of support for him.

The implementation of a bidding process for the 2018 World Cup television rights was seen as a chance to bolster AUF coffers.

This move left Bauzá on bad terms with Uruguay network Tenfield and it would open up another political battlefront for him with the most powerful man in Uruguayan football – media mogul and owner of Tenfield, Paco Casal.

Television rights

In addition to retaining World Cup rights, Casal also launched a bid in 2013 to obtain the Copa Libertadores rights from the present rights holders in South America. According to reports from Latin America, Casal’s group offered up to five times more than the current holders and was still snubbed. The backlash of this would that set off this entire political power struggle.

Bauzá failed to respond when asked to by the clubs. This confrontation led to a strain in relations between the two sides as Bauzá was also a CONMEBOL executive committee member. Eventually Peñarol and seven other clubs took legal measures on their own, trying to indict CONMEBOL and president Francisco Figueredo in a Uruguayan court after $150m disappeared from the confederation’s coffers.

Financial woes

There was also bickering regarding the distribution of moneys from the national team matches. According to VTV pundit and Sport 890 host Martín Charquero, the money the AUF gave to clubs was miniscule compared to the national team.

For many, like Charquero, it is part of the reason hindering the progress of the Uruguayan league.

“When Uruguayan clubs need money, they don’t go to AUF, they go to Tenfield,” said Charquero. If Tenfield wanted to boycott Bauza, the first thing they would have done is to tell the clubs that they don’t have money and the league would have been stopped immediately. The league would die.”

New administration

After Bauzá’s resignation was accepted, Rentistas vice-president Wilmar Valdez became the new interim boss at the AUF. This came after Danubio president Oscar Curuchet changed his mind about the post. His change of heart was based on CONMEBOL provisionally suspending the AUF during their executive board meeting in Santiago, Chile earlier in the day.

This led to hours of debates and a violent exchange between Peñarol president Pedro Damiani and Nacional representative Javier Gomensoro.

An apocalyptic status quo was established with the forced departure of Bauzá. The league resumes play as scheduled, the disciplinary code was finally passed without any opposition and the solutions to some problems were found.

Now the big question is if Valdez and the new board elected in July will be able to match what their predecessors accomplished the last few years. The bar has been set high, the standard that they must match at the very least.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2014/4/8/the-gradual-fall-of-bauza-and-the-uruguay-fa,NEGATIVE,0.9562777280807495
Copa America,Messi scores hat-trick as Inter Miami enter Club World Cup 2025,"On-fire Lionel Messi scored his second hat-trick of the week and Luis Suarez scored twice as Inter Miami beat the New England Revolution 6-2 to smash Major League Soccer’s regular season points record and confirm their participation in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025.

Miami’s win in their final game of the regular season took them to 74 points – one more than the previous record, set by New England in 2021.

Messi, who came off the bench in the 58th minute and led the late flurry of goals, has now scored 20 goals in 19 appearances in MLS with his former Barcelona teammate Suarez also notching 20, from 27 games.

The challenge of breaking the record added some spice to the final game of the regular season with Inter having already secured the Supporters’ Shield for the best record in the regular season to stamp themselves as clear favourites in the MLS Cup playoffs which start next week.

Miami had trailed 2-0 until Suarez scored twice before half-time to help Gerardo Martino’s team level at the interval.

Goals from Argentinian Luca Langoni and Colombian Dylan Borrero in the 34th minute had the home crowd chanting for Messi’s introduction from the bench, but it was Uruguayan Suarez who began the comeback with a firm left-foot finish.

Then Suarez levelled with a fine solo finish, making space for himself and switching to his right foot before drilling home.

Messi, who had scored a hat-trick for Argentina against Bolivia on Tuesday, came off the bench in the 58th minute and immediately helped put the team ahead finding Jordi Alba, who set up Benjamin Cremaschi for a tap-in.

New England thought they had drawn level with a goal from striker Bobby Wood but the effort was disallowed for handball following a VAR review.

Messi then made it 4-2, collecting a back-heeled pass from Suarez before brilliantly blasting into the far bottom corner.

The Argentinian was on target again when he latched on to a superb pass from Jordi Alba and made no mistake, completing his hat-trick in the 89th minute when he met a volleyed cross from Suarez with a precise first-time finish.

Messi’s three goals came within 11 minutes, and after his two-month injury absence after the Copa America, he now looks back to his best.

At the post-game celebration of the Supporters Shield success, club co-owners David Beckham and Jorge Mas were joined by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who announced that the Shield had earned the team a place in the 2025 Club World Cup.

Miami will take the qualification slot designated for the host nation.

“Inter Miami qualifies as the host country representative team on the basis of the club’s outstanding and consistent 34-match campaign that saw them secure the shield with two MLS matches to play,” FIFA said in a statement.

The official champions of MLS are determined by the MLS Cup playoffs, which begin next week and conclude with the final on December 7.

Miami are the favourites to win the playoffs, but the FIFA decision to select the regular season winners ensures the involvement of the Argentinian superstar.

The participation of the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi is a much-needed boost to the profile of the new-look tournament, which FIFA hope will capture the imagination of the global television audience as well as fans in the United States before the World Cup in 2026.

The competition could pit Messi against top European club opposition for the first time since he left Paris Saint Germain last year to move to Miami.

The 32-team tournament will feature title-winning teams from each of FIFA’s continental confederations.

Players’ union FIFPRO and the European Leagues body filed a joint complaint to the European Commission against FIFA over the introduction of the tournament into the international match calendar.

Copa America,Robinho spot on for Brazil,"





Brazil failed to produce the performance that has come to be almost expected of them, but they did enough in their match with Ecuador to make the Copa America quarterfinals via a disputed Robinho penalty.

They will be joined there by Chile, who ground out a goalless draw with already qualified Group B winners Mexico earlier on Wednesday.









Brazil failed to find their rythym in the first half in Puerto la Cruz and Ecuador threatened several times.

However 11 minutes after the break Giovanni Espinoza was adjudged to have hauled down Robinho and a penalty was awarded despite Ecuadorean suggestions that the dimunitive Brazilian striker might have made a meal of the challenge.

The Real Madrid striker duly tucked away the spot kick notching up his fourth goal of the competition so far.

The young Brazilian team, missing Ronaldinho and Kaka, then held Ecuador off to finish second in the group despite only showing faint glimpses of the traditional flowing football the five-time World Cup winners are famed for.

They will now face Chile in the quarterfinals on Saturday in a rematch of Sunday’s game in which Robinho notched a hatrick to register a 3-0 win.

Ecuador went home without a win despite having fielded much of the same squad that helped it qualify for the past two World Cups, including reaching the second round in Germany last year.

Chilean standoff

Chile booked their spot in the last eight by drawing 0-0 with Mexico earlier on Wednesday.

The Chileans were more dangerous early on but proved ineffective in the area and Humberto Suazo’s driving shot at the 21st minute flew just over the bar.

The game resorted to a series of counterattacks in the second half.

Mexico will play Sunday in Maturin against the loser of Thursday’s match between Paraguay and Argentina.

Copa America,How Muchachos became Argentina’s unofficial World Cup 2022 anthem,"Doha, Qatar– It has been Argentina’s unofficial anthem during World Cup 2022: “Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos a Ilusionar” (Boys, we have our hopes up again) has beensung with much fervor inside the stadiums, at Doha’s labyrinthine Souq Waqif and by players in Argentina’s dressing room.

The song tells a story.

The lyrics make reference to Argentina’s football legend, the late Diego Maradona, to the team’scurrent superstar Lionel Messi, to previous heart-breaking losses at the World Cup, to last year’s Copa American triumph, and the hopes now pinned on winning a third World Cup trophy in Qatar.

The song’s popularity surged on social media last year after Argentina defeated Brazil 1-0 in the Copa America final. Earlier this year, Messi said that it was his favourite football chant and a video of him singing some of the words went viral online.

Even the Argentina players on the bench are singing “Muchachos” with the fans in the stadium!! Incredible atmosphere again!pic.twitter.com/FuWNEG9vFx

— Julien Laurens (@LaurensJulien)December 13, 2022



But what the fans and players are singing is an adapted version of the 2003 tune Muchachos by the Buenos Aires punk band La Mosca.

The lyrics have been rewritten by Argentina supporter Fernando Ramos. Translated into English, the song goes something like this:

I was born in Argentinaland of Diego and Lionel,of the kids of Malvinas,that I will never forget.I can’t explain it to youbecause you won’t understandthe finals we lost,How many years have I mourned them

But that’s overbecause in the Maracana,the final with the brazucas,dad beat them again.Boys, now we got excited again,I want to win the thirdI want to be world championand Diego, in the sky we can see him,with Don Diego and with la Tota,encouraging Lionel.

Buenos Aires resident Martin Montalto told Al Jazeera that every Argentine recognises the song.

“It makes me so emotional when I hear it, I get goosebumps,” the 23-year-old said. “The energy in the stadium just reaches a crazy level when people start singing Muchachos. You almost feel like crying… but with happy tears.”

Juan, another Argentina fan, said the song gave him “chills” every time he heard it. The reference to the Malvinas was “specially moving”, he said, explaining that it is an ode to the Argentinian soldiers who fought against British forces in 1982 in what is commonly referred to as the Falklands war – the name the United Kingdom gave the islands located some 480km (300 miles) off the southern tip of South America.

“The memories are still fresh for many people back home. Those who died are like heroes we can never forget,” said Juan, a 46-year-old from Buenos Aires who now lives in New York.

Football writer Karan Tejwani believes Argentina’s Muchachos anthem is “thesong of the World Cup” – and not just for Spanish speakers.

“I don’t speak Spanish, neither do many people I know, but we know the words. That’s how popular it’s become,” the UK-based sports writer told Al Jazeera. “I think of it as one of my favourite chants.”

Tejwani, author Glorious Reinvention: The Rebirth of Ajax Amsterdam, said the lyrics also encapsulate the ups and downs of Messi’s international career.

“It mentions how the fans grew to love him and it seems as though after years of criticism, they finally hold him in the same regard as Maradona,” he said. “For Argentina, this World Cup, the context and the Messi factor, the song is brilliant and it goes beyond just football.”

The World Cup in Qatar is Messi’s last and the final shot at global supremacy, lifting the trophy that has eluded him during his illustrious career. The Albiceleste last won the World Cup in 1986, when Maradona led the team to victory.

Argentina play reigning champions France in the World Cup final on Sunday and the sound of thousands of Argentinian fans signing Muchachos is certain to reverberate throughout Lusail Stadium.

These are the lyrics to the song in Spanish:

En Argentina nacíTierra del Diego y LionelDe los pibes de MalvinasQue jamás olvidaréNo te lo puedo explicarPorque no vas a entenderLas finales que perdimosCuantos años la lloréPero eso se terminóPorque en el MaracanáLa final con los brazucasLa volvió a ganar papáMuchachosAhora nos volvimos a ilusionarQuiero ganar la terceraQuiero ser campeón mundialY al DiegoDesde el cielo lo podemos verCon Don Diego y La TotaAlentándolo a LionelMuchachosAhora nos volvimos a ilusionarQuiero ganar la terceraQuiero ser campeón mundialY al DiegoDesde el cielo lo podemos verCon Don Diego y La TotaAlentándolo a Lionel, y ser campeones otra vez, y ser campeones otra vez",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2022/12/17/muchachos-argentinas-anthem-and-the-song-of-world-cup-2022,POSITIVE,0.9973846077919006
Copa America,Barcelona sign Chilean Alexis Sanchez,"Barcelona have made their first move in the transfer market by signing Serie A player of year Alexis Sanchez from Udinese.

The Catalan giants will be an even greater attacking threat next season after their latest acquisition.









European champions Barca announced on Thursday they had reached a deal with Italian club Udinese to buy the striker for $36.9 million.

The 22-year-old will sign a five-year contract, the club said in a statement on their website.

“Barcelona and Udinese have reached an agreement on the transfer of Alexis Sanchez. The deal is for five years. The cost of the transfer is 26 million euros ($36.9 million),” said the statement.

The deal could be worth a total of $54 million depending on appearances.

Sanchez, who will be the first Chilean to play for the club, will undergo a medical test, sign the contract and be presented on Monday.

Sanchez has played for Udinese since 2008 and last season was voted best player in Serie A, after scoring 12 goals in 31 games.

In demand

The player had also been linked with English sides Manchester United and Manchester City, but said last month that he wanted “Barcelona or nothing”.

And Barcelona he got.

He “has been sought by the best teams in the world. However, he has been strongly committed to playing for Barca,” the statement said.

Barca coach Pep Guardiola said this week that his priority for the upcoming season was signing a forward, with Sanchez his top target.

“(He) has been sought by the best teams in the world. However, he has been strongly committed to playing for Barca”

A statement on the Barcelona website read

“He is a very young player, can play in three attacking positions, has a lot of intensity in defence, very vertical, unbalancing, and from what I’ve been told he’s a very good guy,” he told a news conference on Tuesday.

The signing is the first of the new season for Barca, where Sanchez will join the likes of Argentine star Lionel Messi and Spain’s David Villa.

Guardiola has also said he is not giving up the fight to sign midfielder Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal despite the determination by Gunners’ boss Arsene Wenger to hold on to his captain.

Barcelona starts a pre-season tour of the United States with a friendly against Manchester United in Landover, Maryland on July 30.

Copa America,Brazil football legend Pele recovering after tumor operation,"Brazilian football great Pele has undergone surgery for a suspected colon tumour and is recovering, the hospital in Sao Paulo treating him announced.

“The tumour was identified during routine cardiovascular and laboratory examinations and the material was sent for pathological analysis,” said the Albert Einstein Hospital on Monday, where Pele has been treated since August 31.

“I thank God for feeling very well,” the 80-year-old wrote on his Instagram page on Monday.

“Fortunately, I’m used to celebrating great victories alongside you.

“I will face this match with a smile on my face, a lot of optimism and joy for living surrounded by the love of my family and friends.”

Pele is due out of intensive care on Tuesday, the hospital said in a statement.

Pele, whose real name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, has been in poor health in recent years and has had various spells in hospital, most recently in April 2019 in Paris because of a severe urinary tract infection.

Back in Brazil, he had a kidney stone removed.

At the end of 2014, he suffered from a serious urinary tract infection and was placed in intensive care and on dialysis.

He also has hip problems and needed a walker to move around during his latest public appearances.

In February 2020, Pele reassured his fans about his mental health, after remarks by his son Edinho saying that he was “reclusive” and suffering “from a certain form of depression”.

The only player in history to win three World Cups – in 1958, 1962 and 1970 – Pele is considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/6/brazil-football-legend-pele-recovering-after-tumor-operation,POSITIVE,0.9953832030296326
Copa America,No Messi or Ronaldo among Ballon d’Or nominees as Spanish stars dominate,"For the first time since 2003, neither Cristiano Ronaldo nor Lionel Messi have been included as the nominees for the men’s Ballon d’Or award, with England’s Jude Bellingham among the 30 footballers named.

Portugal superstar Ronaldo, who has won the award five times, had failed to receive a nomination last year also, while Messi, who won for a record eighth time in 2023 and has been nominated 16 times, missed out despite Argentina’s Copa America win this year.

Spain, winners of Euro 2024, have six players nominated, including 17-year-old Barcelona winger Lamine Yamal, along with Nico Williams, Alejandro Grimaldo, Dani Olmo, Rodri and Dani Carvajal, who also won the Champions League with Real Madrid.

Real have a total of seven players nominated, including Kylian Mbappe who recently signed from Paris St Germain, with Bellingham and Brazil’s Vinicius Junior among the Spanish club’s other nominees.

England, runners-up to Spain at Euro 2024, have five other nominees apart from Bellingham: Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden.

Rodri, who was named the player of the tournament at the European Championship, said his team deserved to have one of their players win the Ballon d’Or.

While the prestigious award has been dominated by Spanish league players, no Spaniard has won the prize for best player in the world since Barcelona great Luis Suarez in 1960, despite Spain’s “golden generation” that won the 2010 World Cup, as well as the 2008 and 2012 Euros.

Not only did Spain play a perfect European Championship by winning all seven games in Germany, but they also scored 15 goals, the most by any team in a Euros.

“Spanish football deserves a Ballon d’Or winner,” the Manchester City player said after the final. “I’m going to be honest, I would like for a Spaniard to win it, I don’t care who. It would be great.”

Asked about his chances of winning the award, Rodri said, “I’ve heard that [Champions League winners Real Madrid’s] Dani Carvajal also deserves it. From an individual standpoint, I’m very proud of what I am doing and the recognition I’m getting. But someone else has to make that assessment.”

In the women’s Ballon d’Or Feminin, Champions League winners Barcelona have six nominees in total, including last year’s winner Aitana Bonmati and two-time winner Alexia Putellas.

Copa America,About Us,"When Al Jazeera launched from the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday, November 1, 1996, it was the first independent news channel in the Arab world. Media in the Arab world, till then, was characterised by state-controlled narratives that denied audiences the right to know and the right to be heard.

Al Jazeera pioneered a new paradigm for in-depth journalism that was relevant to its audience, giving them a broad and deep perspective on regional and international affairs, putting the human being directly at the centre of the news agenda. The Channel’s founding tagline, “The Opinion and the Other Opinion”, encapsulated bringing multiple angles to a story, informing and empowering its audiences, championing their stories, while maintaining the spirit of journalistic integrity.

Al Jazeera introduced what came to be known as the “Al Jazeera Phenomena”. It was a turning point in the history of Arab and global media that inspired academics and researchers to study and analyse this phenomena for years to come. Al Jazeera is now one of the largest and most influential international news networks in the world.

The road to success, however, has not been without its challenges. The Network and its journalists have been in the crossfire, and at times paid a heavy price for seeking to bring the truth to its audiences.

In the face of these pressures on the Network, and its journalists, Al Jazeera continued on its journalistic mission and garnered international recognition and awards for its in-depth and uncompromising journalism.

Over the years, Al Jazeera’s expansion into new channels, subsidiaries and digital content is a testament to its constant determination to evolve and deliver unmatched professional journalism to its audiences. The Network presents impartial news, programmes, current affairs, and in-depth investigations that push the boundaries of traditional media.

Al Jazeera is also continuing to pioneer new and emerging storytelling techniques that cater to a new generation, presenting an ever-innovative portfolio of digital products that inform, empower, and educate, whilst maintaining its founding principles.

Al Jazeera Media Network is ideally placed on the world stage with its headquarters in the Arab world, with over 70 bureaus around the globe, and more than 3,000 employees from more than 95 countries. Al Jazeera has extensive reach across the globe and is available in over 150 countries and territories in more than 430 million homes.
